# Summary

## Textual element

The City of Helsingborg has a long track record of working to decrease its climate impact and improve the local environment with benefits to public health and economic development. It is a city at the forefront of innovative approaches to urban development and improved services for local people and business. The city has a policy focus on Quality of Life which drives an integrated development agenda with a strong focus on environmental issues for a more sustainable city. Helsingborg has committed to be climate neutral by 2030 and is an active partner in both the Swedish Viable Cities initiative and Net Zero Cities.

This document sets out the overarching policy framework, governance and innovation capacity of the city as well as its prioritised actions to reach the net zero target. It aims to reduce emissions by 85% from 1990 levels with a focus on five key areas:

Energy
Mobility and transport
Waste and circular economy
Green industry
Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions

This document shows the challenges in each of these areas and lays out a project portfolio to address these challenges. The actions include a number of major investments in new infrastructure, ranging from an electric high-capacity bus rapid transport system to a major hydrolysis plant to replace natural gas in industry. It also includes a plan to build a second larger scale biochar plant and carbon capture and storage facility at the waste-powered CHP plant to address residual emissions. These major single point capital projects are complemented with other initiatives ranging from charging infrastructure for freight and cars to mobility management and partnership approaches with communities and other stakeholders to support behavioural changes or new agricultural practices.

A collaborative approach is a prerequisite for the delivery of this ambitious programme. Helsingborg has a strong joint approach within the municipality and with the municipal companies that include the energy and waste utility companies who are major investors in the climate transition. The city also has a strong working relationship with other major businesses and industries and has mobilised key business partners through the Helsingborg Declaration and the Helsingborg Climate Pledge to tackle climate emissions together. Helsingborg has a history of partnerships and innovation with the local community and civil society across issues ranging from culture and the arts to the environment. Engaging actively with communities to understand their challenges in climate transition and co-designing solutions will be key to enabling a high level of adoption of low-carbon behaviours. A strong co-design process will also help to ensure that the process of change can maximise co-benefits, support improved quality of life for all citizens, not least that of under-represented or marginalised groups, and ensure a just transition.

Helsingborg's Climate Action Plan is the first iteration of a highly ambitious yet achievable programme of works to drive the city's work to become climate neutral by 2030. Significant challenges lie ahead, as do countless opportunities to mobilise communities and businesses to build a long-term commitment that can drive economic development, improve quality of life and keep driving down the climate footprint beyond net zero.

# Introduction

## Helsingborg's Climate Neutrality Ambition

The goal is clear: Helsingborg aims for complete climate neutrality by 2030. In pursuit of a sustainable and responsible future, we come together as a city, mobilising our resources to make climate neutrality not just an ambition but a reality.

Helsingborg's climate neutrality goal is based on the municipality fulfilling its obligations under the Paris Agreement. This entails reducing direct greenhouse gas emissions within the city and those from energy use by at least 85% compared to 1990. Increased carbon sinks will compensate for the remaining emissions.

The climate neutrality target covers the entire administrative territory of Helsingborg, with no exclusions for sectors, scopes, sources, or gases. The target addresses both direct emissions occurring within Helsingborg's geographic boundaries (such as emissions from vehicles and industries, categorised as scope 1) and indirect emissions from electricity and district heating use (scope 2). The definition of the target is to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions under scope 1 and scope 2 by at least 85% by 2030, compared to 1990. Carbon sinks will then offset any remaining emissions. Although Helsingborg also has targets covering scope 3 emissions, these are not included within this Climate City Contract (CCC).

Achieving Helsingborg's vision requires both innovative thinking and responsible action, with equal attention to the social, ecological, and economic dimensions of sustainability. The city aims to ensure a high quality of life for all residents while maintaining a low environmental impact. This approach not only benefits the current generation but also safeguards future generations, enabling both individuals and businesses to thrive within a framework of long-term sustainable growth.

Reducing emissions and reaching net-zero will bring significant positive side effects. These include improved air quality, better public health, and enhanced urban environments, all contributing to increased well-being for citizens. By lowering emissions, Helsingborg will also foster economic opportunities, driving innovation and green job creation, which will support the city's goal of sustainable growth.

Key to this transition are the transition team and the transition arena, as outlined in Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions. These initiatives are crucial for driving the actions needed to achieve net-zero emissions. They also focus on highlighting and leveraging positive synergies between sustainability efforts, ensuring that the benefits of reducing emissions extend across all sectors of society.

An essential part of Helsingborg's approach to achieving climate neutrality is reflexive learning. After each phase of monitoring and evaluation, it is critical to engage in continuous learning to improve and adapt the city's climate strategies. This process ensures that Helsingborg remains agile, identifying what works, where adjustments are needed, and how new knowledge can shape future efforts. Reflexive learning helps drive progress by incorporating lessons learned and ensuring that climate actions remain effective and relevant in a rapidly evolving context.

This learning will take place both within Helsingborg's internal governance structures and through collaboration with regional partners. The city is part of a regional Learning Hub, a joint initiative with Lund University, Lund Municipality, and the City of Malmö, as outlined in Module C-1.1 of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality. By leveraging the resources of the Learning Hub, Helsingborg ensures that it is not working in isolation but as part of a regional effort to achieve climate neutrality, benefiting from the collective insights and experiences of its partners.

Helsingborg's profound commitment to environmental issues is reflected in our strong focus on innovation, testing, and action, ensuring that we are prepared for the future. This commitment is one of our greatest assets in achieving our goals. The transition to a climate-neutral Helsingborg by 2030 presents a significant challenge, but it also provides an opportunity to learn, innovate, and make a tangible difference swiftly.

The City of Helsingborg employs around 12 000 people, all of whom play a crucial role in supporting Helsingborg's climate neutrality goals. To meet these goals, the city must reduce emissions at four times the rate previously achieved, with a focus on its highest-emitting sectors: transport, incineration of fossil plastics, and the use of natural gas in industry.

# Emissions and Challenges Ahead

In 2022, the total greenhouse gas emissions within scope 1 and scope 2 were approximately 470 000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. Transport remains the largest source of emissions in Helsingborg. Significant emissions also stem from industrial energy use, particularly natural gas, and from the incineration of fossil plastics for district heating production. From 1990 to 2022, greenhouse gas emissions in Helsingborg decreased by 56 per cent. This reduction is primarily attributed to the transition to renewable energy for electricity, heating, and industry. Improvements in energy efficiency, more energy-efficient vehicles, and the use of biofuels for road transport have also contributed significantly to this decline.

Figure 5: Distribution of emissions in Helsingborg 2022
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Transportation (mainly passenger cars)
Energy (mainly fossil plastics in residual waste)
Industry (mainly use of natural gas)
Work machines (construction and industry)
Agriculture (mainly carbon losses from arable land and fertilizer use)
Waste (mainly landfill gas)
Product use (mainly fluorinated gases)
Heating of private homes (mainly natural gas)

The Helsingborg group (comprising municipal departments and companies) has direct and indirect control over many of the emissions within Helsingborg's borders. It can facilitate and create the conditions for others to reduce their emissions, for example by encouraging reduced car dependence or increasing opportunities for charging electric vehicles. Achieving climate neutrality will require close cooperation between the group and other stakeholders, including authorities, academia, businesses, civil society, and residents.

Collaboration with local businesses, community groups, and regional and national actors is key to reaching our goals. In particular, it is vital to work with stakeholders responsible for transportation, such as Region Skåne, which provides public transport, influences travel behaviour, and is affected by national legislation. Moreover, the group must support industries in transitioning from natural gas to more sustainable energy sources. Other key partners in emission reduction include Nordvästra Skånes Renhällning AB (NSR) for waste management and Öresundskraft for energy provision.

# Key Frameworks for Climate Neutrality

Helsingborg's Climate Action Plan (CAP) aligns with existing frameworks and serves as an umbrella that integrates the city's Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) with other local strategies. The SECAP, which sets specific targets for each emission sector, is the cornerstone of Helsingborg's climate neutrality efforts. It outlines how the city, in collaboration with stakeholders from academia, businesses, and the community, will work towards achieving these goals. This comprehensive approach is supported by the Climate Action Plan (CAP) and Climate Investment Plan (CIP), which detail the specific actions and investments required to meet these ambitious targets.

Local policies, such as the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), are essential in addressing emissions in key sectors, further aligning with the overarching sustainable development strategies in Helsingborg. Together with the Comprehensive Development Plan 2021, which focuses on land use and development through 2050, and
HELSINGBORG

the Quality-of-Life Programme, which addresses broader issues like public health and employment, these initiatives place climate mitigation and sustainability at the heart of the city's decision-making process. This integrated approach not only ensures progress towards climate neutrality but also maximises co-benefits such as social inclusion and economic development.

The Climate City Contract (CCC), developed alongside the SECAP, complements it by providing detailed pathways for sector-specific transitions towards climate neutrality. While the SECAP is legally mandated under Swedish law and carries more weight, especially given its accessibility to local actors by being in Swedish, the CCC offers additional value by outlining potential steps within the SECAP framework. Together, the SECAP and CCC ensure that Helsingborg's efforts are both grounded in current realities and flexible enough to adapt to future challenges.

In conclusion, Helsingborg's integrated approach—anchored by the SECAP, supported by the CCC, and aligned with other local strategies—ensures a comprehensive path towards achieving climate neutrality by 2030. The SECAP remains the most significant guiding document for local stakeholders, while the CCC adds dynamic support and international alignment to the city's climate ambitions.

# Looking Forward: Adapting and Refining Climate Strategy

As Helsingborg looks to the future, the city remains committed to continuously assessing and refining its climate strategies. The next version of the SECAP, expected in December 2024, will guide climate actions from 2025 to 2030, with a mid-term review in 2027 and a final assessment in 2030. The CCC will be updated biennially to incorporate new developments, ensuring that Helsingborg stays on track to meet its 2030 goals.

Innovation and collaboration are key drivers of Helsingborg's climate ambitions. A dedicated transition team will oversee the implementation of the city's plans, while a transition arena will bring together government, industry, academia, and civil society to co-create solutions. This inclusive approach ensures that the city's climate transition is fair, equitable, and responsive to the needs of all its residents.

In conclusion, Helsingborg's Climate Neutrality Action Plan reflects a comprehensive and integrated approach to sustainability. By aligning climate action with social and economic goals, the city is creating a roadmap not only for reducing emissions but also for improving quality of life, fostering innovation, and ensuring long-term sustainable growth. Through collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to inclusivity, Helsingborg is paving the way for a climate-neutral future by 2030.

# 2 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

Part A “Current State of Climate Action” describes the point of departure of the city towards climate neutrality, including commitments and strategies of key local businesses, and informs the subsequent modules and the outlined pathways to accelerated climate action.

# 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Module A-1 “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory” details and describes the latest GHG inventory, where available from 2018 or more recent, referring to a clearly stated geographic boundary. The aim of this section is to establish the emission baseline and to establish the emissions gap to 2030 climate neutrality according to the inventory specifications defined in the Cities Mission’s Info Kit for Cities² and the process outlined in the CCC Action Plan Guidance and Explanations. It includes:

Definition of geographic boundary of the GHG inventory and, if applicable, excluded areas, sectors, scopes, sources, gases.
An explanation of any (current) mismatch between the boundary of the GHG inventory and the climate-neutrality target, including actions planned to address the mismatch.
Key data and visualisation of the latest GHG inventory (ideally not older than 2018), according to the coverage (source sectors, scopes, and gases) specified in the Mission’s “Info Kit for Cities” to establish the emission baseline. If additional inventories are used in the CNAP, the same information should be provided for all inventories.
Descriptive assessment of current GHG inventory, including a description of the current state of each emitting sector.
Where a BAU scenario is used as baseline, a description of methodology and assumptions (for instance, which sectors/sources/gases are actually modelled; locally specific input variables vs. national or default data, etc.).

# GhG Emissions Baseline inventory

An accurate and comprehensive emissions inventory is a cornerstone of Helsingborg’s strategy towards achieving climate neutrality. Aligned with the city’s climate neutrality target, the emissions inventory has been uploaded as part of the CCC and meets the criteria set out in the Cities Mission’s Info Kit for Cities.

Helsingborg’s key systemic priorities are closely tied to the findings of the emissions inventory, which highlights transportation, energy, and industry as the largest sources of emissions. Of these, transportation contributes the most significantly to the city’s carbon footprint, and as such, the city’s impact pathways and proposed actions are heavily focused on this sector. However, achieving climate neutrality requires emissions reductions across all sectors, making a comprehensive approach essential.

The city’s SECAP, and to a large extent, the CCC, are structured around the data from the emissions inventory. For each sector, Helsingborg has established specific emissions reduction targets and

identified the key shifts required to achieve these goals. Furthermore, the plan highlights critical stakeholders whose engagement is vital to ensure the success of the climate neutrality strategy.

Given Helsingborg's long-standing tradition of climate action, the year 1990 has been selected as the base year for the climate neutrality target, mirroring the base year used in Sweden's national climate goals. For tracking progress, 2022 serves as the benchmark, being the latest year with available data on greenhouse gas emissions. In Part A of the action plan, data on both energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases for 1990 and 2022 are provided, allowing for a clear comparison of progress over time.

By basing our strategic actions on this thorough emissions inventory, Helsingborg ensures that our climate goals are grounded in robust data, guiding the city on its path to climate neutrality by 2030.

# A-1.2: Emission factors applied 1990

The method used to calculate emissions are GPC-CRF. Scope 2, stationary energy, is calculated with energy data according to Table A-1.1 and local emission factors for electricity and district heating. Emission data for scope 1 stationary energy, transport, waste, AFOLU and IPPU are retrieved from the Swedish national emission database which is established through a collaboration through IVL Swedish Environmental Institute, SCB Statistics Sweden, the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). Emission data and emission factors from the national emission database includes CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFC and PFC. Methodologies are in accordance with 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Some of the most relevant emission factors are listed below. The rest can be found in the following database: ef-bilaga-klimat2.xlsx (live.com)

# A-1.2: Emission factors applied 2022

The method used to calculate emissions are GPC-CRF. Scope 2, stationary energy, is calculated with energy data according to Table A 1.1 and local emission factors for electricity and district heating. Emission data for scope 1 stationary energy, transport, waste, AFOLU and IPPU are retrieved from the Swedish national emission database which is established through a collaboration through IVL Swedish Environmental Institute, SCB Statistics Sweden, the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological institute (SMHI). Emission data and emission factors from the national emission database includes CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFC and PFC. Some of the most relevant emission factors are listed below. The rest can be found in the following database: ef-bilaga-klimat2.xlsx (live.com) Methodologies are in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. For 2022 emissions from leakage from landfills, composts and biogas production are measured by the municipality owned waste company NSR. Emissions from work machines in the port of Helsingborg are calculated by the Port of Helsingborg.

|  District heating | 53 g/kWh |  |  |  | Within Helsingborg's heating sector, district heating is the most common form of heating. Climate emissions resulting from district heating use are calculated similarly for electricity based on an emission factor corresponding to the fuel mix found in the district heating network. Today, these emissions mainly come from the system's co-generation production, which releases both biogenic and fossil carbon dioxide as a result of energy recovery from waste destruction.  |

# 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

Module A-2 "Current Policies and Strategies" lists and assesses existing policies, strategies, initiatives, or regulation from local, regional, and national level, relevant to the city's climate neutrality transition. This assessment contributes to identifying the gap (if any) between the emissions reduction due to existing initiatives and the city's 2030 climate neutrality target. Filling this gap by identifying additional actions and levers to achieve the city's emission reduction target is the focus of this Action Plan. The assessment of current policies and strategies offers hence a starting point for exploring the impact pathways (See Part C). The module includes:

Comprehensive list of local relevant policies, strategies, concepts, as well as of regional and national legislation that impact local climate action.
Descriptive assessment of the current climate-relevant policy context, summarising the objectives and implementation concepts, addressing e.g., spatial planning, energy, local economy, circular/bioeconomy, waste, transport, housing, urban greening/nature-based solutions).
Quantification of the emissions gap (i.e., emissions reduction target minus reductions already addressed through existing climate action plans).

# A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies

In evaluating Helsingborg's transition to climate neutrality by 2030, we have reviewed existing policies, strategies, programmes, and regulations at the local, regional, and national levels. This assessment highlights the complexity of predicting their impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly as many national and international policies depend on shifting political and economic conditions, making them difficult to assess at the municipal level.

We have begun the process of mapping existing and relevant policies in Table A.2.2.1, identifying key initiatives detailed in Table A 2.2.2 that are expected to drive significant reductions in GHG emissions. These policies are critical to the city's climate goals. If implemented as planned, they will contribute substantially to our overall emission reduction targets. However, we recognise that there are likely many additional policies important for local climate action that have yet to be fully mapped. This work needs to continue to ensure we have a comprehensive understanding of all relevant policies that can support our transition.

For most sectors, it is possible to separate the impact of these policies from the actions in the Action Plan (Part B). However, it is more challenging in the road transport sector, but we have been careful to avoid double-counting emissions reductions. Based on current data, after accounting for the effects of existing policies, the remaining gap to the 2030 target is approximately 396 000 tons of CO2e. Helsingborg's SECAP suggests that increased carbon sinks could offset up to  $15\%$  of 1990 emissions, equivalent to 171 000 tons of CO2e, leaving 225 000 tons to be reduced through the actions outlined in Part B of the Action Plan.

In addition to mapping existing policies, it will be essential to distil international and national policies into local strategies. By doing so, we can better understand how to align these broader frameworks with our local climate goals, maximising their benefits to achieve meaningful progress. Moreover, the possibility of mapping upcoming national and EU strategies will allow us to better prepare for future frameworks that could impact local climate work, ensuring that Helsingborg stays ahead of new developments.

It is also encouraging that multiple policies across sectors reinforce each other, increasing the likelihood of achieving significant GHG reductions. The combined effect of these policies should be assessed collectively, rather than in isolation, to fully understand their total impact. However, the estimates provided are based on current knowledge and may require ongoing refinement as more data becomes available. Further details can be found in Section B 2.3 which explains residual emissions and the strategy for moving forward.

The CCC will be used primarily by the Transition Team as a horizontal policy integration tool. This will provide a holistic overview of actions, costs, synergies, and co-benefits, facilitating a more coordinated and effective approach to the city's climate transition.

We believe that there are good chances of reaching the electrification targets for the transport sector for Helsingborg, because the government and private actors are pushing for electrification in parallel with the city group implementing its actions (B-part of CCC). In order to reach the national emissions target as well as the transport target, a shift from car journeys to active transport and public transport will also be necessary. Emission reductions from that type of actions are primarily included in Helsingborg's action plan in part B of CCC. Here we have modelled the total potential for the transition we want to see, using a model developed by Stockholm environmental institute.

|  The emission reduction scenario presented below reduces emissions in Helsingborg by 83% from 1990 until 2030.The current climate and energy plan for Helsingborg is valid 2018-2024, so most of the activities related to that plan have already been implemented.The climate and energy plan for 2025-2030 is currently under review. Actions related to that plan are listed in column 6 (same as described later in section B of the Action Plan). In column 4 are activities that we can clearly distinguish from what we include in column 6, mainly emission reductions related to existing national legislation and targets. The emission reduction due to existing policies and CCC actions are best estimate based on the knowledge we currently have within the organization and should not be taken for absolute values. Calculations need to be refined and adjusted on an ongoing basis.We report emissions and emission reduction from grid supplied energy separately to avoid double counting. Emissions from grid supplied energy is indirectly included in stationary energy (scope 2) because it affects the emission factor for electricity and district heating.  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

This module aims to document the conclusions of a systems and stakeholder mapping aimed at identifying systemic barriers and opportunities. In conjunction with the GHG inventory and the policy baseline analysis in the previous two modules of Part A, the analysis reported here serves as a basis for designing actions that address these barriers or exploit the underutilised opportunities in Part C. The results of this analysis as provided here include:

A description of the main systems related to the city's GHG emission domains, e.g., technological/infrastructural, institutional/ regulatory, organisational, financial, political, social and behavioural systems.
A description of barriers and opportunities for each of the systems above. This includes gaps (infrastructural/ technological, institutional/ regulatory, organisational, political, financial, behavioural or social) as well as an evaluation of unexploited resources (e.g., renewable energy sources, digital technologies, etc) or circumstances.
A map of stakeholders involved for each of the systems above. This includes relevant actors per systemic element at different levels of governance throughout the whole policy cycle, such as local, regional, national, and EU/supranational administrative bodies and agencies, civil society, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), academia, community-based organisations, social movements, steering groups, private sector actors etc.

# A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

The basis of Helsingborg's climate transition work is a strong infrastructure of well-developed and - managed systems for energy, transport, and waste management. These have been developed over a longer period to decrease climate impact and improve service in the city. The existing infrastructure has potential to contribute further to the climate transition through the development of climate neutral solutions and the integration of new technologies and infrastructure into the systems.

However, the challenges are more complex than merely a transition and additions to the existing technical systems. A long-term programme of works to decrease emissions from centralised technical infrastructure has contributed to significant historical reductions. This has involved a small number of stakeholders with significant emissions, mandate, and ability to reduce those emissions. However, it is increasingly the case that reductions in remaining emissions become increasingly dependent on the active choices and actions of many stakeholders with smaller emissions at an individual level but with a significant cumulative effect. This may be through a larger number of small businesses, or through the general public of citizens, commuters and employees. This is particularly the case in areas such as mobility where low-carbon solutions need to be attractive, efficient, flexible, accessible, and affordable for them to be seen as a viable option.

The next steps in the transition process will therefore need to combine major infrastructure investment and adaptation, and softer measures to ensure an uptake of new alternatives available. Major infrastructure investment may have challenges related to technology, finance, or

business model. Softer measures may also need new business models and other approaches to behavioural change to drive the transition process.

## Mapping of stakeholders and their link to system barriers and opportunities

Achieving net zero requires close co-operation between stakeholders at local, regional, and national levels as all the works are deeply interdependent. Local policies in Helsingborg depend on regional authorities for infrastructure co-ordination, and national governments for legislative frameworks and funding. Without this alignment, progress toward our climate goals will be significantly hindered.

Transport remains the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Helsingborg, making it a critical area for targeted actions. Reducing these emissions requires collective efforts of businesses, government, civil society, and citizens. To address this challenge, we have launched the Helsingborg Declaration, an initiative designed to enhance collaboration and strengthen linkages across the entire logistics chain. The declaration aims to accelerate climate change adaptation through concrete, collaborative projects, driving sustainable solutions in transport and logistics. By bringing together key stakeholders, we are creating a united front to tackle the urgent issue of transport-related emissions.

However, the journey to net zero requires continued efforts to deepen co-operation. There is a clear need to establish additional networks and platforms that can foster stronger partnerships between key actors in the climate transition. Building these connections is essential for ensuring that all stakeholders can contribute meaningfully to Helsingborg's climate goals. Through collective action, Helsingborg can lead by example, demonstrating how cross-sector collaboration can pave the way for a sustainable, low-emission future.

Beyond the key stakeholders listed in table A-3.2: Systems &amp; stakeholder mapping, other important actors - though harder to categorise - also play a vital role. International organisations provide funding and expertise, financial institutions enable green investments, and the media shapes public attitudes toward climate action. While these groups may not fit neatly into specific categories, their contributions are essential to Helsingborg's transition to net zero. Together with the efforts of more traditional stakeholders, they underscore the collective nature of this challenge and the need for widespread engagement.

## Results of the analysis

Within most of the fields of action there are multiple barriers and opportunities. Some of these are already reflected in individual actions in the Action Plan. Others may become actions in coming iterations of the Action Plan or part of overarching governance and support work by the transition team.

The following table provides a comprehensive overview of the systems and barriers and opportunities for the transition process in Helsingborg based on the different fields of action.

|  Field of action: Energy Systems  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Type of system | Description of system  |
|  General description | Helsingborg has an energy system consisting of district heating, electricity, district cooling and gas (figure 7). In Helsingborg, the energy sector's emissions mainly come from the use of electricity, district heating and district cooling, as well as individual solutions for heating in homes.  |

|   | The district heating network in Helsingborg is part of a regional network with several production sources. Helsingborg's part of the production consists of two local cogeneration plants (simultaneous production of heat and electricity) as well as waste heat from industry and water treatment plants. Thus, the local district heating in Helsingborg was produced with 100% recycled or renewable energy. The electricity grid supplies Helsingborg with electricity both from local production (cogeneration, wind power and solar power) and electricity that is distributed via the overlying regional grid which is part of a larger northern European system. The municipality's district cooling is produced by free cooling from the sea together with a district heating-driven absorption chiller supplemented by liquid cooling units. The gas network in Helsingborg is part of a regional gas network that stretches along the west coast with a connection down to Denmark, and is supplied, like the electricity network, by a certain amount of locally produced biogas which is supplemented with biogas and natural gas supplied through the surrounding gas network.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Type of Barrier | Description of Barrier  |
|  Behavioural | Fossil emissions from district heating production is one of the main emission sources in Helsingborg and originates mainly from plastic produced from fossil raw materials, which are thrown in the residual waste and then burned in the cogeneration plant. According to Swedish law, it is forbidden to landfill residual waste. The waste is instead recovered for energy in cogeneration plants to produce local district heating and electricity. Heat recovery from residual waste will continue to be an important function until 2030 and plastic will most likely continue to occur in residual waste.  |
|  Financial | The municipal energy company plans for carbon capture and storage at the district heating plant. This requires a lot of electricity and is expensive to operate. Business models to cover the costs of operating the CCS facility need to be put in place.  |
|  Technological/ Infrastructural | In order to solve the climate challenge, a large part of the fossil fuels that today are mainly used in transport and industry will be phased out and replaced by electrified solutions. This leads to a greatly increased need for electricity. At the same time, production of electricity is changing to increasingly consist of renewable weather-dependent sources such as solar and wind power. Expansion of this new production of electricity takes place above all in the northern parts of Sweden, which means that large amounts of electricity need to be distributed south to also supply southern Sweden with electricity. This places high demands on the main, regional, and local grids, which then need to have sufficient capacity to be able to deliver electricity at the right time. Reinforcements and expansion to cope with this transfer are underway, but it will take time. The consequence will be a limited supply of electricity in the southern parts of Sweden. Helsingborg, its residents, and businesses thus need to economise on the electricity effect in order to continue to enable Helsingborg's development in the future.  |
|  Lack of control | Lack of control over the electricity grid and lack of local electricity production. This prevents direct interventions in the share of renewables in the electricity mix and reducing the CO2 per KWh.  |

|  Regulatory/ Conflict with biodiversity and agriculture land | In Scania's power commission's roadmap, wind power is singled out as a key component to reach the goal of 50 % self-sufficiency in electric power. There are challenges to expand wind power in and around Helsingborg, among other things due to protected bird species that are killed in the wind turbines. For large-scale solar production, there is a conflict with agricultural land.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Organisational/ Social and behavioural | The challenge with production of solar electricity lies in making use of all the electricity produced by solar cells so that there is no need to send out too much surplus quantities to the electricity grid and risk overloading it. Solutions are needed to enable increased self-use of solar electricity. By 2026, solar electricity production is estimated to correspond to 15 % of Helsingborg's annual electricity use, and this needs to be able to be integrated into the electricity system in a sustainable way.  |
|  Technological | The need for electricity storage is large due to increased electrification and a greater share of renewable weather-dependent electricity production. To make wind and solar power more accessible, supplementation with some type of energy storage is needed, so that production can add electrical power regardless of whether the sun is shining, or the wind is blowing. Storage solutions can also contribute with balancing and flexibility services and in a way contribute to a more stable electricity supply.  |
|  Type of Opportunity | Description of Opportunity  |
|  Financial | The municipal energy company Öresundskraft plans to implement carbon capture and storage at the cogeneration plant. The design of international and national instruments and legislation is underway which will enable financing.  |
|  Organisational/ technological/infrastructural | Helsingborg has unique opportunities to benefit from the establishment of logistics and warehouse premises in the city. These roof surfaces are excellent locations for the installation of solar cell systems. The group plays a central role in accelerating the transition and promoting the expansion of local electricity production by actively promoting investments in solar cells. Through effective cooperation between the city, energy companies and business, the implementation of solar cell installations in these strategic locations can benefit and solar electricity can be integrated into the energy system in a sustainable way. This way, Helsingborg can become a forerunner as a logistics hub and contribute to meeting the common climate goals.  |
|  Field of action: Energy system (built environment)  |   |
|  Type of system | Description of system  |
|  General description | Within this category, we focus on the use of electricity and heat in homes and properties. In Helsingborg, most houses are heated with district heating. The district heating network is well-developed in the central parts of Helsingborg. But there are areas on the outskirts that do not have access to the district heating network. Emissions from the homes/properties come from the use of natural gas for heating and from the use of electricity. Approximately 1 300 households in Helsingborg heat their houses with natural gas. An efficient use of electricity plays a decisive role in climate change, where above all transport and industry are completely dependent on available fossil-free electricity. An important part of the transition is to reduce and streamline the use of electricity as much as possible only goes, so that electricity is freed up and can meet the increased demand.  |
|  Type of Barrier | Description of barrier  |
|  Technological/Infrastructural | Natural gas used for heating houses mainly occur in areas that do not have access to the city's district heating network.  |

| --- | --- |
|  Technical, Behavioural | The national organisation Fossil-free Sweden's national efficiency strategy shows that nationally there is a potential to save around 11 % of the electricity in homes, premises, and industries.  |
|  Infrastructural, Organisational | In Helsingborg, there has been local production of biogas for many years, and thus there is knowledge and infrastructure that facilitate an increased production of biogas, which could be used to phase out natural gas for heating or from the use in industries.  |
|  Organisational | Administrations and municipal companies in Helsingborg today have a good dialogue and good co-operation regarding planning conditions for future electricity use in Helsingborg.  |
|  Technological/Infrastructural | Expansion of the district heating network is an opportunity to phase out natural gas. District heating reduces the need for electricity for heating and enables local electricity production in Helsingborg's cogeneration plant. The production of district heating also supplies electricity and electrical power when it is needed most. When it is cold outside and the heating demand increases, local electricity is produced at the same time. This contrasts with electrically powered heating alternatives, such as heat pumps, which instead contribute to an increased use of electricity during these cold periods. If you change from electric heating to district heating, electricity and electric power are freed up for other purposes.  |
|  Financial | There are government subsidies for private individuals living in detached houses powered by direct-acting electricity or gas. This support drives the conversion from heating with direct electricity or gas to district heating or heat pump, but also other energy-saving measures.  |
|  **Field of action: Mobility and Transport (on road)**  |   |
|  Type of system | Description of system  |
|  General description | Helsingborg is a logistics hub and home to Sweden's second largest port. Many logistics companies are established in the area. It is possible to move quickly in the region by rail. There are ferries across the strait to Denmark. The central station in Helsingborg is called “Knutpunkten” and all buses, trains and ferries depart from there. There are also commuter train stations in several locations in the municipality. Helsingborg is growing, which means that more people and more goods need to stay and move on the same surface. Helsingborg must have a sustainable, safe and accessible transport system that meets the needs of 160 000 inhabitants by the year 2030. The City of Helsingborg, in collaboration with business and academia, aims to be Europe's most sustainable and fast-moving logistics hub, and the port of Helsingborg must be the country's most sustainable. Transport is the largest source of fossil emissions in Helsingborg and accounted for 36 % of the total emissions from scope 1 and scope 2 in 2022. Of the transport sector's emissions, the largest part comes from passenger cars. When private individuals travel within Helsingborg, they choose car in the first place. Just over half of the number of trips is made by car.  |
|  Type of barrier | Description of barrier  |
|  Social/Behavioural | Significant behavioural changes are needed for several transitions in personal mobility. Among other things, we need to build a stronger cycling culture.  |
|  Social/Behavioural | Fleet replacement takes time; a certain number of fossil-fuelled vehicles will remain in operation in 2030.  |

|  Infrastructural | Charging infrastructure for different types of rechargeable vehicles needs to be expanded in a sufficiently fast and effective manner, both regarding the electrical system and for the vehicles to be charged.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Regulatory | Helsingborg as an individual actor does not have full discretion to reduce transport emissions sufficiently on its own to achieve the goal. Co-operation between different key actors is necessary. The reduction obligation, mandatory mixing of a certain amount of biofuel with petrol and diesel, has been the most important steering tool to promote bio-based fuels. However, the current government has decided to lower the reduction obligation to a minimum and proposes to lower fuel taxes on petrol and diesel.  |
|  Financial, Social & Behavioural | Limited acceptance of changes among citizens can impact support and impact financial resources available.  |
|  Type of opportunity | **Description of opportunity**  |
|  Organisational | Business is an important and often driving force in the transformation of the transport sector. The business world's willingness to phase out fossil fuel-powered vehicles and make their transport more efficient is crucial. The Helsingborg Declaration and Climate Agreement in Helsingborg are networks that contribute to the transformation of the transport sector at the local level.  |
|  Organisational | Helsingborg has a dedicated sustainability team in the Procurement Department that has extensive experience in setting requirements for fossil-free transport services.  |
|  Infrastructural | We have 10 locations in Helsingborg with their own railway station, which facilitates commuting by train.  |
|  Technological | Public transport within Helsingborg is already 100% fossil-free today.  |
|  Social/Behavioural | A large proportion of those who commute to work by car live close enough to their workplace to cycle instead.  |
|  Field of action: Mobility and transport (off road) |   |
|  General description | Work machines fulfil many important social functions. Within Helsingborg, work machines are used, among other things, for digging and moving materials in the construction sector, for moving goods in the port, for ploughing arable land and for the maintenance of green areas in the city. Work machines include energy-driven work tools and work vehicles that are not intended for transport by road, such as tractors, excavators, forklifts and ride-on lawnmowers. Handheld work tools such as chainsaws are also counted here. Work machines account for 11 % of the emissions within scope 1 and scope 2 in Helsingborg. To reduce emissions from work machines, a switch to fossil-free fuels is primarily required. This can mainly be done by shifting from fossil diesel to biofuels such as HVO100 (100 % hydrogenated vegetable or animal oil), and by a transition to emission-free machines, i.e. machines that are operated with electricity or hydrogen.  |
|  Type of barrier | **Description of barrier**  |
|  Technological/Infrastructural (Safety) | If Helsingborg switches to electric machines, there could be problems in crisis situations. The Helsingborg group must be able to maintain functions even during long-term power outages. This may mean having back-up power or alternative plans to continue running important operations even if there are problems with the power grid.  |
|  Technological | The range of electric work machines is still limited  |

|  Financial | The investment cost for an electric machine is significantly higher than for a traditional machine. The City of Helsingborg and municipal companies need to find business models that do not exclude small and medium-sized entrepreneurs due to the increased investment costs.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Type of opportunity | **Description of opportunity**  |
|  Social (CO-benefits) | A transition to emission-free machines is desired by many because they reduce the local emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides that pollute the air while reducing noise in and around workplaces.  |
|  Organisational | The City of Helsingborg is expected to have a great opportunity to influence the actors who work with construction and operation, as we are a major customer of their services.  |
|  Field of action: Waste and circular economy |   |
|  General description | Helsingborg strives to convert waste into resources. Food waste is digested into biogas and biofertiliser, plant nutrients and heat are recovered through source-sorting sewage systems, and garden waste is turned into biochar. In connection with the treatment of waste and purification of wastewater in Helsingborg, however, greenhouse gases are also emitted. The largest emissions from treatment of waste come from incineration of residual waste for the purpose of energy recovery, which is also described in the energy system section. There are also emissions from the decomposition of organic waste in the landfill. At the waste facility, nitrous oxide and methane are also released during composting of garden waste. During biogas production from food waste there is a minor leakage of methane gas. At the wastewater treatment plant, there are emission of methane and nitrous oxide when treating wastewater and sludge. Municipal companies NSR and NSVA are responsible for waste and wastewater in the municipality.  |
|  Type of barrier | **Description of barrier**  |
|  Social/behavioural | Reducing the plastic in residual waste is a way to reduce emissions from waste incineration. However, each resident in north-western Scania throws an average of around 25 kilos of plastic into the residual waste per year. There is a long way to go to change behaviour to eliminate plastic in residual waste.  |
|  Type of opportunity | **Description of opportunity**  |
|  Organisational | NSR (Nordvästra Skånes Renhållningsaktiebolag) has the authority to implement measures required to reduce emissions from waste management. Technology solutions for implementation are already available today.  |
|  Infrastructural | on-site/ near house collection of plastic packaging has been offered for 20 years.  |
|  Technological/Behavioural | The municipal waste company has started a competence and development centre with the aim of making use of different types of waste more efficiently and creating new circular energy and material flows. The centre offers a testbed for developing tomorrow’s technology solutions.  |
|  Organisational (important for scope 3) | Public procurement has the potential to become a powerful tool in a transition to a circular economy. Most of the purchases made in a municipality are common to all municipalities. Collaboration around requirements facilitates a more thorough market analysis and creates the opportunity to set more appropriate requirements.  |
|  Behavioural (important for scope 3) | About a third of the waste in Sweden comes from construction. Much of the waste can continue to be used. Saving and recirculating the materials in our built environment can reduce both society’s environmental impact  |

|   | and costs. There is an increasing interest from construction companies in contributing to reduced construction waste.  |
| --- | --- |
|  **Field of action: Green industry**  |   |
|  General description | In Helsingborg, it is mainly the chemical, pharmaceutical and metal industries that generate emissions within industry. It is mainly the use of natural gas that gives rise to emissions within the sector. Natural gas is used both as a fuel for energy processes and as an input when it is used and consumed in production. A stable and safe supply of natural gas has been an important factor behind the establishment of existing industry in Helsingborg.  |
|  **Type of Barrier** | **Description of barrier**  |
|  Financial | The biggest obstacle to climate change is that it is still not profitable for most industries to change production. The costs of production without fossil fuels are often high and investments involve high risk because the technologies are new and immature. In some industries, continued research into alternatives is also needed technician.  |
|  Financial/ lack of control | Fossil-free manufacturing depends on the construction of an 80MW hydrolysis facility to produce hydrogen, but there has been no decision on this facility yet.  |
|  Technological/Infrastructural | Electricity is an enabler for industry in the energy system of the future. In the transition to processes that do not require fossil fuels, a sharp increase in electricity use is expected. As described in the energy chapter, the availability of electricity and power in northwestern Scania is estimated to be limited until 2030.  |
|  **Type of opportunity** | **Description of opportunity**  |
|  Technological/Infrastructural | Biogas has the potential to replace fossil gas in various industrial processes, where it can be used both as fuel and input. In Helsingborg, there has been local production of biogas for many years, and thus there is knowledge and infrastructure that facilitate an increased production of biogas, which could be used to phase out natural gas for heating or from the use in industries.  |
|  Infrastructural/Organisational | The Helsingborg region has been identified as a possible cluster for hydrogen production, which could contribute to a phasing out of fossil gas in industry.  |
|  **Field of action: Nature based solutions**  |   |
|  General description | Helsingborg municipality consists of more than two-thirds of agricultural land (22 426 hectares). Helsingborg is also a coastal municipality. Located at the Öresund. There are 22 nature reserves in the municipality, of which 2 are marine reserves.  |
|  **Type of Barrier** | **Description of Barrier**  |
|  Conflict over land | Carbon storage is generally higher in natural soil than in arable land and lowest in hard-made surfaces. Restoration of forests, natural and pasture lands and rewetting of drained peatland are cost-effective measures to increase the natural carbon sinks. It also contributes to creating stable ecosystems and leads to more land within the municipality gaining natural values and becoming natural environments, which is important for reaching the environmental and public health goals in the Quality-of-Life program. The challenge is that the measures conflict with using the fertile land in Helsingborg for growing food.  |
|  Lack of control | The challenge when it comes to agricultural land is that it is mainly owned and managed by private landowners. The city of Helsingborg owns 1 250 hectares of agricultural land which is currently leased out to farmers.  |

# 3 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part B represents the core of the CCC Action Plan, shaped by local authorities, local businesses, and stakeholders, comprising of the most essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, action portfolios and indicators for monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

# 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 "Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways" lists and describes impact pathways, early and late outcomes and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) according to and adapted from the NetZeroCities Theory of Change and the CCC Action Plan Guidance – clustered by fields of action.

List of impact pathways, selected from or inspired by the NetZeroCities Theory of Change, including early and late outcomes (strategic objectives) and levers of change structured along the fields of action.
Descriptions of the impact pathways, summarising their relationship with key priorities and strategic interventions and with the analysis developed in Part A

## B-1.1: Impact Pathways

Impact pathways are attached in a separate document.

## B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The impact pathways presented in Table B 1.1 are based on the key shifts required to achieve climate neutrality, as outlined in Helsingborg's proposal for a new SECAP. These shifts were developed through sector-by-sector analysis, involving working groups with representatives from municipal administrations, municipal companies, local businesses, and academia. Together, these stakeholders have assessed the opportunities and challenges of reaching climate neutrality by 2030. The impact pathways have made these shifts concrete by breaking them down into specific levers and identifying the necessary early changes.

These pathways align with the systemic strategic priorities outlined in Helsingborg's 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments, focusing on reducing emissions from the city's largest sources: transport, energy production and distribution, building heating and electricity use, and industry. Transport remains Helsingborg's biggest source of emissions and is therefore the primary focus of the impact pathways, with the most proposed actions targeting this sector. However, to achieve climate neutrality, all sectors must reduce their emissions, and the impact pathways account for this need.

The level of detail within each pathway varies, depending on the city's discretion over emissions reductions in a given sector. For example, the energy sector, where the city has more control, has seen more advanced planning for its transition. In all cases, the pathways are built by starting with desired outcomes for 2030 and then backtracking to identify the early changes required to reach those goals. The prioritisation of pathways is supported by detailed descriptions of individual

actions, helping decision-makers focus on the early changes that will enable the most impactful measures.

The early steps of the impact pathway broken down into the different levers also helps to counteract many of the barriers highlighted in section A3.

The structures established to support climate neutrality, such as the Transition Team mentioned in Part C of the Action Plan, are designed to facilitate the implementation of these actions and initiatives. They also ensure that the actions follow the identified impact pathways, addressing different barriers to achieving climate neutrality while enabling existing strategies.

Helsingborg's journey towards net zero is outlined through a comprehensive list of proposed actions that align with the objectives of the SECAP. While these actions provide clear direction, timelines, budgets, and the specific scope of certain measures are still under development. As a result, they may be subject to change following further assessment and decision-making.

The emission reduction potential of the actions has in most cases been estimated in collaboration with the company ClimateView and the external consultant company Afry. The estimates have been made based on an impact assessment methodology developed by ClimateView. The methodology is based on the fact that climate transition can be divided into a number of shifts from a high-carbon activity to a low carbon activity that fulfill the same need. An example of a shift is a trip made by an electric car instead of a fossil driven car. The first step of the impact assessment is to identify what shift it related to the action that will be assessed. Actions are then divided into three different categories. They can be direct, indirect, or enabling actions. Direct measures lead to a shift without affecting the attributes of the city. For example, if the city group changes its fossil-powered cars to electric-powered cars the attributes of the city will not change. But many actions are indirect, and therefore affect the attributes of a city to encourage people to change behaviour so that a shift occurs. For example, by shortening the distances to public transportation both behaviour and attributes of the city will be affected. Enabling interventions serve as catalysts for other direct or indirect interventions. When the shift and action types are identified, an assessment is made of how large an impact a certain action has on a shift. For indirect measures and enabling measures, this is done qualitatively. The method also handles the need to evaluate the combined effect that several different actions can have on one and the same shift, as well as the cases where certain actions have an impact on several different shifts.

The emission reductions and cost estimates presented in Section B2.2 are based on the City of Helsingborg's current knowledge but should not be taken as absolute values. These calculations will need to be refined and adjusted as more information becomes available. The list of proposed actions should be viewed as a flexible framework that prioritises emission reduction strategies, which, based on current analysis, offer the most reliable path to success. By contrast, estimations of carbon sequestration, including natural sinks, are often less reliable due to environmental variables and uncertainties in long-term impact.

Additionally, the City of Helsingborg has applied for funding through the EU Innovation Fund for its Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) initiatives. The final decision on municipal investment in CCS will be made by the City Council in early 2025, which could significantly shape future planning.

In summary, while the proposed actions offer a solid foundation for achieving climate neutrality, flexibility will be crucial as the city continues to refine and adjust its approach. The impact pathways will guide this process, helping overcome barriers and ensuring alignment with Helsingborg's climate neutrality strategies.

|   |  Action description | Within Helsingborg, district heating is the most common form of heating. District heat and electricity production generates fossil emissions from plastic produced from fossil raw materials, which are thrown into the residual waste and then burned in the cogeneration plant. The potential for a CCS plant is to reduce fossil emissions from burning of waste by 90%. The CCS also has capacity to capture CO2 from biogenic origin and create a carbon sink, by storage of the CO2.  |

|   |  Action description | The south of Sweden has a low degree of self-sufficiency in electrical power. This is a limitation for the electrification in the region. Therefore, a regional goal is set to increase the self-sufficiency to 50% by 2030.
By predicting the hours when the need for electrical power is greatest and then proactively working to keep power peaks down, there will be a more even power output and a lower load on the power grid. One way to do this is to apply flexible electricity use, for example by using electricity during times of the day when demand is low. The Helsingborg group can contribute a large system benefit because the group accounts for a large part of the total electricity use in the municipality. This is done by inventorying, streamlining and thus controlling the need for electricity.  |

|   |  Action description | Households in Helsingborg who currently heat their homes with natural/fossil gas shift to district heating.
Helsingborg considers it important to promote district heating. District heating reduces the need for electricity for heating and enables local electricity production in Helsingborg's cogeneration plant. The production of district heating also supplies electricity and electrical power when it is needed most. When it is cold outside and the need for heating increases, local electricity is produced at the same time. This is in contrast to electrically powered heating alternatives, such as heat pumps, which instead contribute to an increased use of electricity during these cold periods. If you change from electric heating to district heating, electricity and electric power are freed up for other purposes.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

(Detail where residual emissions stem from, provide a more detailed rationale for ruling out emissions reduction options, and how residual emission will be compensated, if applicable. Include the expected breakdown of natural sinks, permanent sequestration, and offsets.). Only options that durably store carbon captured from the atmosphere should be part of the residual emissions strategy. If non-durable options are included, the strategy should discuss how the city intends dealing with reversals.

# Buildings, district heating (scope 2)

Within Helsingborg's heating sector, district heating is the most common form of heating, and the emissions correspond to approximately  $35\%$  of the emissions from energy use within the municipality. Climate emissions resulting from district heating use are calculated similarly for electricity based on an emission factor corresponding to the fuel mix found in the district heating network. Today, these emissions mainly come from the system's cogeneration production, which releases both biogenic and fossil carbon dioxide because of energy recovery from waste destruction. The fossil emissions are mainly derived from plastics produced from fossil raw materials, which are thrown in the residual waste and then burned in the cogeneration plant. As we are planning a CCS facility at this cogeneration plant, the emissions in this sector will be greatly reduced.
HELSINGBORG

## Buildings electricity (scope 2)

Electricity use in Helsingborg accounts for approximately 60 % of the emissions from energy use. Helsingborg's electricity supply is highly dependent on supply from the regional grid, where the local electricity production accounts for a small proportion of the total electricity demand in the municipality (self-sufficiency rate approximately 20 % on an annual basis). The climate emissions resulting from the municipality's electricity use are calculated based on an emission factor corresponding to a consumption network mix for the Swedish electricity area 4, taking into account imports and exports from and to surrounding electricity areas. The municipality therefore cannot fully control emissions in this sector. We lack a forecast of how the emission factor for electricity will develop. In Helsingborg, we are currently counting on an emission factor of 55 g CO2e per kWh of electricity used. According to the Swedish Energy Authority, the average emission factor for electricity in Sweden is 26 g CO2e per kWh. We therefore assume that we will approach 26 g CO2e per kWh in Helsingborg by 2030. The expansion of renewable energy is expected to increase significantly in Sweden (mainly wind power) and Europe, which will have a positive impact on the emission factor. The emission factor could decrease more by 2030 than what we have calculated here.

## Buildings individual heating of homes and premises

The emissions come mainly from the use of natural gas in about 1 300 households. There are good opportunities to greatly reduce emissions in this sector by switching to district heating and heat pumps. However, we estimate that there will be a smaller percentage of households left in 2030 that have not yet converted to a renewable heating system. The municipality can enable a shift, but cannot require households to convert.

## Transport, on road (scope 1&amp;2)

To reach the ambition of net zero emissions in Helsingborg it is necessary that the fossil emissions from transport continue to decrease, and at a rapid pace. The pace of change needs to increase drastically. When national policy instruments such as reduction obligations of fossil fuels and climate bonuses for car purchases disappear, greater efforts are required at the local and regional level, by both public and private actors. The city can create conditions for emission reductions in the transport sector. This happens, among other things, in urban planning, in prioritising land use and by setting climate requirements in procurement. However, the city as an individual actor does not have full discretion to reduce transport emissions sufficiently on its own to achieve the goal. Co-operation between different key actors is necessary. The number of actors who need to act in a short time, and the fact that the transition is to some extent based on how the residents choose to travel, means that we do not believe that we can reduce emissions within the sector by more than 85%. Currently, there is also uncertainty as to exactly how the emission reduction will take place. We calculate the emission reductions based on a possible scenario.

## Transport, air, water, rail (scope 1)

Helsingborg also has certain emissions from domestic flights, shipping and railways. The industry organisation for domestic aviation aims to be fossil-free by 2030. Local emissions from shipping and railways are already relatively small in relation to how much is transported with these means of transport. Currently, we do not see that these will decrease to a greater extent until 2030. Emissions from shipping will decrease to a larger extent towards 2050 due to EU regulation: According to EU
HELSINGBORG

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

regulation, the amount of greenhouse gases from ships must be reduced by two % from 2025, 14.5 % from 2035 and 80 % from 2050, compared to 2020 levels.

## Transport, scope 1, machines

Emissions from machinery mostly come from the construction and industrial sector and from road works. Emissions also come to some extent from work machines that cut grass on public and private lawns. Through requirements on contractors and through declarations of intent regarding fossil-free and emission-free work machines together with other municipalities, most emissions will be able to be cut by 2030. However, there will be actors within the municipality who have not been able to shift to fossil-free fuels by 2030, mainly due to financial reasons.

## Waste (solid waste disposal, biological treatment, wastewater) (scope 1)

The municipal waste company has full authority to implement the measures required to reduce emissions from waste management by 85%. Technology solutions for implementation are already available today. The remaining 15% is difficult to reduce before the entire landfill is finally covered, which it is not expected to be in 2030. Emissions from composting and biogas production are also not expected to be completely solved by 2030.

## IPPU, Industrial Process (scope 1)

Emissions in the industry sector come primarily from the use of fossil gas in industry. Emissions in the sector can be almost completely reduced by 2030, but this requires local hydrogen production which can replace natural gas. This brings with it challenges in terms of costs. It is also a tight timetable to get all parts of the facility and infrastructure in place by 2030. Currently, there is no definitive decision on whether a facility will be in place by 2030.

## IPPU, product use (scope 1)

Emissions of greenhouse gases from this emission sector mainly consist of leakage of fluorinated gases. The use of fluorinated gases is regulated by the EU in the form of regulations, directives, and other legal acts. The municipality has little discretion to reduce these emissions. But new legislation in Sweden in combination with technological development is expected to reduce emissions further.

## Agricultural, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU), sources include livestock, land use, other (scope 1)

Greenhouse gases are emitted in the form of methane and nitrous oxide from animal digestion and fertilizers (mainly artificial), as well as carbon dioxide and other climate gases from arable land. Emissions are greatest from carbon losses from agricultural soil and from the use of artificial fertilizers. There is a great potential to reduce carbon losses from arable land and store more carbon in arable land. Reducing the emissions caused by animal digestion and the use of artificial fertilisers does not have much potential in Helsingborg because the number of farms with animals is few, and the use of artificial fertilizers already complies with the legislation. We expect that most emissions from fertiliser use will remain in 2030.

## Grid supplied energy

The emissions from grid supplied energy will almost be gone by 2030 through implementation of a CCS plant at the cogeneration plant.

## Carbon sinks for compensation of residual emissions
HELSINGBORG

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Technologies for directly capturing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the air are a very important part of the solution. Technology that separates carbon dioxide from the air is already being tested today at the Filbornaverket in Helsingborg.

With a newly inaugurated facility to produce biochar in operation and an established competence centre for biochar, Helsingborg also has a unique opportunity to take the lead in demonstrating how biochar can play a significant role in the climate transition.

The capacity of natural carbon sinks in Helsingborg, such as forests, seas, and soil, is also crucial for achieving climate neutrality. Developing these natural carbon sinks not only provides climate benefits but also promotes biodiversity and soil fertility, creates opportunities for tourism and business, and strengthens ecosystems' resilience to climate change. There is particularly good potential to increase the carbon sink in Helsingborg's agricultural land since the areas are large and the carbon content is low.

## Targets in line with the Paris Agreement

Helsingborg's target of climate neutrality is set based on what is required for Helsingborg to fulfil our part of the Paris Agreement. The target means that direct greenhouse gas emissions within Helsingborg and emissions from energy use must decrease by at least 85% compared to 1990 levels. Increased carbon sinks will compensate for the remaining emissions. Fifteen% of the 1990 emissions corresponds to 170 000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.

## How to reach the target

To create carbon sinks equivalent to 170 000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, a balance between investing in innovative carbon storage technologies and increasing natural carbon sinks is required. Capturing and storing biogenic carbon dioxide emissions, which occur during biomass combustion at the Filbornaverket, has the potential to create a carbon sink equivalent to 100 000 tons of CO2e per year. To achieve climate neutrality by 2030, natural carbon sinks (including biochar) need to increase by 70 000 tons of CO2e by then.

## Increase Carbon Sequestration with Carbon Capture Technologies

The municipal energy company Öresundskraft is planning to reduce the emissions from Filborna's combined heat and power plant by investing in a carbon capture and storage (CCS) facility. The facility will separate carbon dioxide from the flue gases produced by the combustion of residual waste. The carbon dioxide will then be permanently stored underground. In addition to capturing 100 000 tons of carbon dioxide from the combustion of fossil plastics, the facility will have the capacity to capture 100 000 tons of carbon dioxide from the combustion of biomass in the residual waste, such as cardboard, thus functioning as a carbon sink. The more plastic that is sorted out from the residual waste, the greater the amount of carbon dioxide from biomass combustion that can be captured.

## Increase Biochar Production

Biochar acts as a long-term carbon sink because it is a very stable carbon compound that can be preserved in soil for up to 1 000 years. It can be mixed into soil where it helps to bind nutrients and water, and its porous structure gives soil a light and airy texture. During the biochar process, energy is released which can be utilized in the district heating system. Helsingborg has recently inaugurated Sweden's largest facility to produce biochar from garden waste, with the capacity to sequester 3 500 tons of CO2e per year. Expanded production requires additional access to organic material as raw material. In Helsingborg, wood chips, among other things, could be used for production.

However, it is important to consider whether biomass by-products might generate more climate benefits by replacing fossil fuels. Biochar actions are also described in the pathways and action portfolio but not counted toward the 85% reduction in emissions because it is counted here toward residual emissions.

## Increase Carbon Sequestration in Agricultural Land

More than two-thirds of the municipality consists of agricultural land. A small change in carbon sequestration per hectare of agricultural land in Helsingborg municipality would have a significant climate impact. The challenge for the Helsingborg group lies partly in the fact that the arable land is owned and managed primarily by private landowners. Encouragement, information, and good cooperation between the company and farmers are therefore important. The municipality can also help create financial incentives for farmers to manage the land in ways that store more carbon. The City of Helsingborg owns 1 250 hectares of agricultural land that is currently leased to farmers. Here, the City of Helsingborg has more control and sees an opportunity to, through new leases, ensure that the land is managed with methods that lead to increased carbon content in the soil.

## Increase natural carbon sinks in soil and vegetation

How land is used and managed affects whether it functions as a source or sink of carbon dioxide. Carbon sequestration is generally higher in natural land than in arable land and is lowest in hardened surfaces. Restoration of forests, natural and pasture lands, and re-wetting of drained peatlands are cost-effective measures to increase natural carbon sinks. This also helps create stable ecosystems and leads to more land within the municipality gaining natural values and becoming natural environments, which is important for achieving the city's environmental and public health targets.

The challenge is that these measures conflict with using the fertile land in Helsingborg for food production. However, converting arable land to natural land in strategic locations can benefit food production by creating shelter, improving the water balance, increasing pollination, and reducing the risk of pest attacks.

Nationally, there is significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by re-wetting drained soils with high organic material, so-called organogenic soils, which reduces the emission of carbon dioxide. In Helsingborg, however, the area of organogenic soils is relatively small. At the same time, wetlands help to strengthen biodiversity, purify water, and reduce nutrient leakage. The combined benefits can therefore motivate the re-wetting of this type of land.

## Preserve and develop existing carbon sinks in sea, soil, and vegetation

In addition to creating new areas of forest and natural land, it is important to preserve the land we already have; otherwise, the carbon sink and biodiversity decrease. A mature forest can also continue to sequester carbon for many years. Agreements can be made with private landowners who own valuable natural land. It is important that the City of Helsingborg facilitates this work so that landowners see the benefits of protecting land. We also need to ensure that our marine areas have good biological status and that areas with seaweed and eelgrass are preserved and have favourable development. In addition to contributing to high biodiversity, they have the capacity to store carbon to the same extent as a forest on land.

# Carbon sink potential

Below table lists the potential for the different carbon sinks in Helsingborg by 2030. The total potential for carbon sinks depends, among other things, on how large areas are utilized for measures that increase natural carbon sinks.

|  Carbon Sink Potential  |   |   |   |   |

|  Increased area of eelgrass meadows | 1 | Not available | Not available | TBD  |
|  Total carbon sink |  |  | 124 050 |   |

*Not included in total sink. At the moment the agricultural soil is a source of carbon. Changed farming methods will therefore primarily reduce emissions from agricultural land. Carbon losses from agricultural land are included in Helsingborg's total greenhouse gas emissions. They are estimated at around 12 000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year. Therefore, we count changed agricultural practices as a measure for reduced emissions, until the land shifts from a net source to a net sink.

** Not included in total carbon sink since it is not an additional activity.

# How to close the gap

According to Gap table A 2.1, emissions in Helsingborg are assumed to decrease by 83% compared to 1990. To reach climate neutrality, we need to compensate for 191 000 tons of CO2e.

On the scale that carbon sinks are currently being considered in Helsingborg, we reach a total carbon sink of approx. 124 000 CO2 equivalents. Thus, we need to increase the carbon sink by
HELSINGBORG

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

another 66 000 tons of CO2e. To get there, there are a few different possible paths to take. There are ongoing discussions about which route we should take, and there are yet no decision.

## Summary of alternatives

### Reduction of plastic in the residual waste

If plastic in the residual waste is reduced so that the fossil emissions are reduced, the capacity of the CCS plant to capture biogenic carbon dioxide increases. This can, for example, be done on a larger scale through a facility that automatically sorts out plastics. According to calculations for Stockholm Exergy, emissions from waste incineration of household waste can be reduced by 17 % through full producer responsibility. After that, a plastic sorting facility can reduce emissions by a further 67 %. It is based on the fact that business waste is also sorted. Helsingborg's district heating plant also burns imported waste. So the effect of a sorting facility depends, among other things, on which waste fractions are sorted and how much plastic is in the different waste fractions. The incoming waste to Filbornaverket, consists of around 22 % of household waste. If we make use of the potential that Stockholm has calculated and with the assumption that the plastic content in the various plastic fractions would be the same, the emissions from Helsingborg's waste incineration could be reduced by up to 60 000 tons. The calculation is a rough estimate and needs to be adjusted to Helsingborg conditions.

### Increased carbon sequestration in agricultural land

Helsingborg consists of around two-third of agricultural land and the carbon content of the agricultural land is low. Therefore, it is a great potential to increase the carbon content through changed agricultural practices. A conversion of agriculture on 25% of the agricultural land in Helsingborg would result in an increased carbon sink of around 30 000 tons of CO2e.

### Increased forest plantation

In the City of Helsingborg's Green Structure Programme from 2014, there is an ambition to convert 600 hectares of arable land into forest, primarily to benefit biodiversity and recreation. This would also increase carbon storage in soils and vegetation. As there are conflicting targets around land use, forests have not been planted at a rate that corresponds to the ambition. A conversion of 600 hectares of arable land into forest and parkland would result in a carbon sink of around 7,200 tons of CO2e.

### Compensation by carbon credits

According to the regulations for mission cities, there is also the possibility for cities to offset emissions by certified Carbon credits from outside the city's boundary. However, this is a path that we would like to avoid as far as possible. We need to investigate which forms of carbon credits we can support that will ensure a long-term carbon sink.

## 3.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

More specifically:

# Module B-3

For the CCC, Helsingborg has selected a set of required indicators from the NZC indicator framework, which predominantly reflect actual changes in emissions across various sectors. We have also selected a set of recommended indicators from the indicator framework to describe the development of co-benefits, with an initial focus on environment and health. Additionally, we have chosen to include certain indicators that will help assess whether Helsingborg is on the right track in areas where we have identified high risks related to the transition such as for hydrogen production and the conversion of agricultural land (e.g. risks related to mandate and financing).

Within a year, the City of Helsingborg will identify further qualitative indicators needed to monitor the transition process. Experts from each emission sector within the organization will participate in this effort, and social strategists will be consulted regarding indicators within the area of Social Inclusion, Innovation, Democracy and Cultural Impact. For some indicators, targets and milestones are yet to be established. Supplementary indicators, targets and milestones will be included in the next iteration of the CCC.

The Environment Committee is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of targets and actions outlined in Helsingborg's SECAP and CCC. Monitoring and evaluation of the SECAP will be conducted annually, with reports presented to the politicians on the Quality-of-Life Committee, which includes representatives from the municipal council. Additionally, Helsingborg's emissions statistics and climate actions will be reported yearly to the Covenant of Mayors 2030 and the WWF One Planet City Challenge through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The entire CCC will be revised and reported on every two years. Reporting to organizations connected to CDP is an important part of Helsingborg's learning process, as they provide feedback to help the city advance in its climate work.

Helsingborg primarily relies on emissions data from the national emissions database for reporting Scope 1 emissions and energy statistics from Statistics Sweden (SCB) for Scope 2 emissions. A dilemma with the national emissions and energy statistics in Sweden is that there is a delay of 1.5 years before the statistics for a certain year becomes available. Currently, 2022 is the latest year for which statistics are available. Further details regarding data sources can be found in Part A of the CCC.

To support the evaluation and learning process, Helsingborg uses the Climate OS tool, developed by ClimateView. The tool is based on the theory that the climate transition can be broken down into numerous shifts from high-carbon to low-carbon activities that still meet the same needs. For example, shifting from commuting by gasoline-powered car to commuting by electric bus. These shifts form the backbone of the transition. The tool helps conduct a tempo analysis, determining the pace of change required to meet a target within a specified timeframe. The tempo is derived through back casting and helps identify the annual rate of progress needed to achieve long-term goals. For instance, the tempo analysis found that to reduce emissions from the transport sector by 17 000 tons of CO2 per year, an additional 3 800 people would need to switch from personal vehicles to electric buses annually. For a further reduction of 7 000 tons of CO2 per year, an additional 2 900 people would need to start commuting by bike or foot. Results and learnings from tempo analysis will contribute to the work of supplementing the list of CCC indicators and setting targets for the

|  Indicator Name | Modal share of green transport modes (walking, cycling, public transportation)  |
|  Indicator Unit | %  |
|  Definition | An increase in the shares of walking, biking and public transport indicates that the mobility behaviour of the local population has changed and that the preference for climate friendly mobility options has risen. The transport modes walking, biking and public transport are summarized as green transport modes because they cause no (walking and biking) greenhouse gas emissions, or at least significantly less (public transport) greenhouse gas emissions than the transport modes private motor cars or motorbikes. The indicator can be defined as the average number of trips per day that an inhabitant of the city does walking, biking or going by public transport, expressed as a %age of the average total number of trips per inhabitant and day.  |
|  Calculation | $$MS_{green} = ((T_w + T_b + T_{train} + T_{bus} + T_{tram}) / T_{total}) \times 100$$
Where: $T_w =$ Walking trips per capita and day
$T_b =$ Bike trips per capita and day  |

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C “Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030” aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organizational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations – designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified Module A-2 and A-3.

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

This module details the city’s governance innovations for achieving city climate neutrality by 2030, describing innovations in institutional design, in leadership, and in collaborative and outreach processes, whether they are inter-organisational or internal to the key organisations responsible for the city’s climate neutrality target. It also describes expected outcomes, for example how these governance innovations enable climate actions and their co-benefits (outlined in Modules B-1 and B-2), and how they address the opportunities, gaps and barriers identified in Modules A-2 and A-3. This content aims to include:

Descriptions or/and visualisations of a participatory / collaborative governance model to facilitate the city’s climate neutrality target, including institutional design (horizontal links among city institutions, vertical links to other levels of government, roles, responsibilities, ground rules, processes). Building on the systems and stakeholder mapping in module A-3, it highlights the relations and processes established or planned to facilitate joint climate action among stakeholders and systems at relevant levels (e.g., showcasing new organisations, partnerships, alliances, networks, or processes), as well as mechanisms of citizen involvement.

Descriptions of how the governance innovations introduced or planned to reach climate neutrality address some (or all) systemic barriers and opportunities (Module A-3) and contribute to NZC impact pathways (Module B-1), e.g., through improving organisational settings and interorganisational models – horizontally within municipal administration and across local stakeholders in the city ecosystem, as well as vertically at regional and national levels.

## C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

### New approach to governance

Helsingborg is mobilising its resources to drive the climate transition across the municipal organisation, its publicly owned companies and in wider partnerships. The city is establishing a central Transition Team to lead and co-ordinate the transition work, which is organised into thematic areas, each with its own multi-stakeholder working group. The municipality has recently launched an Innovation and Transformation department with an innovation fund and testbed system to support innovation towards climate neutrality. The climate transition is also a focus area for some of the community engagement and environmental education work being carried out by the city. These internal resources are complimented by the Open Academy regional learning arena which is an important resource for shared knowledge development and co-operation with the other Net Zero Cities in the region.
HELSINGBORG

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The policy framework for the governance programme is already in place and the Climate City Contract provides a strategic framework for the delivery stage and is helping to structure the action planning, financial strategy, and investment planning for implementation.

# Cross-sectoral transition arena

The cross-sectoral transition arena forms the basis for Helsingborg's participatory governance for climate neutrality. At the core of this approach is the establishment of a streamlined and coordinated process that will mobilise climate actions across sectors in Helsingborg with the city group (city and city-owned companies) as the key force. A critical aspect of this model is the emphasis on engagement and collaboration. Recognising that climate actions require collective effort, the city is dedicated to building strong and enduring partnerships with a wide array of stakeholders, including public and private sector actors, civil society, and academia. These collaborations are about fostering deep, collective understanding, and broad participation in Helsingborg's transition towards a sustainable future, where every sector of society plays its role.

The transition arena is designed to provide Helsingborg's climate work with a clear and coherent framework. It combines effective coordination, strong partnerships, and a commitment to innovation and education, while ensuring that efforts are continuously monitored and adjusted to achieve the city's ambitious climate goals. This comprehensive approach will help generate the momentum needed to drive the city's climate agenda forward, ensuring a sustainable and resilient future for all its residents.

# Transition Team and Working Groups

The climate transition is a joint commitment and responsibility based on decisions by the municipal council, and actions are implemented by the city group with the support of regulations and ownership directives. In line with Helsingborg's new SECAP and several other policy documents that indicate city-wide directions and objectives, a new organisational structure has been introduced in 2024. It consists of two main components: a central Transition Team and different working groups focused on specific emission sectors.

Figure 7: Transition team and working groups

## The Transition Team

The central Transition Team will be established in the autumn of 2024 to ensure progress and coordination of climate action with the comprehensive responsibility for driving and monitoring climate actions city-wide through;

Co-ordination and Planning: The team will coordinate efforts and plan actions across the city, focusing on optimising and aligning with parallel processes to address impact pathways and systemic barriers.
Monitoring and Problem-solving: By identifying areas where progress is stalled or where goal conflicts arise, the team will support coordinators and project leaders in overcoming these obstacles.
Compilation of Plans: The team is responsible for compiling city-wide documents, such as roadmaps and climate investment plans, as well as for updating Helsingborg's Climate Contract 2030 (a national contract with Viable Cities and Swedish authorities), and the Climate City Contract.
Financing the transition: The team will support the allocation of financial resources for the climate transition and liaise with the finance team regarding the wider investment portfolio. The city plans to stimulate green investments by developing economic incentives that encourage businesses and individuals to adopt more sustainable practices.
Reporting to Management Board: The transition team reports on progress in the transition process to the management board, led by the Environment Director. Regular reports are also made to

political committees by the various technical departments, company boards and the overall political leadership of the council.

## Working Groups for Emission Sectors

The work to reduce emissions will be driven by dedicated working groups, each focusing on a specific emission sector. These working groups are made up of civil servants from the city's administrations and municipal companies, such as the housing company Helsingborgshem, the waste collection company Nordvästra Skånes Renhällning AB, and the energy company Öresundskraft. These working groups are tasked to develop roadmaps that clearly define the actions and initiatives required to reduce emissions within each sector.

## Division for Innovation and Transformation

Over the past three years, the City of Helsingborg has placed particular emphasis on reinforcing the culture, structure, and capacity for innovation. The city aims its innovation work at 15 shared challenges, with a view to creating a smarter, more sustainable, and more inclusive Helsingborg. The four challenges most directly linked to the city's climate actions are:

Reducing the city's carbon footprint and promoting transition to a circular society.
Capitalising on business interests in the green transition.
Engaging and involving citizens in the creation of a more sustainable city.
Utilising data to improve services and quality of life.

The newly established Division for Innovation and Transformation has climate neutrality by 2030 as one of its key focuses and is tasked to support all city administrations and municipal companies.

Examples of department's functions are:

Methodology, process management and evaluation
Portfolio management support for administrations
Support for priority initiatives and scaling up
Coordination of strategic networks and innovation programmes (regional/national/European)
Funding
Collaboration with research
Testbed co-ordination

The department is located in the Helsingborg Innovation District (HEIDI), an innovation hub launched in November 2023 jointly by Campus Helsingborg/Lund University, Region Skåne and the City of Helsingborg. This strategic location means easy contacts between the city and a large community of students and companies that work on smart solutions and collaborations on a daily basis. The ambition is to create long-term capacity for innovation and transformation so that the Helsingborg group can lead, support, and drive the transition process.

# Innovation Fund

In 2023 the City of Helsingborg implemented a central innovation fund to address larger projects that include at least two city agencies with weight placed on projects that include quadruple helix stakeholders.

# Testbed ecosystem

Under the testbed ecosystem umbrella, the city offers both physical and virtual innovation environments where companies, academia and other organisations can collaborate in developing, testing, and introducing new products, services, processes, or organisational solutions. Helsingborg's testbed ecosystem includes both more technically oriented test beds as well as flexible and user-friendly test environments such as living labs. While each individual environment offers a unique opportunity for collaboration, together they also complement each other.
HELSINGBORG

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Here one will find testbeds that offer controlled and often high-tech environments with access to both equipment and basic data. Our RECO concept focuses on innovation and development for the circular transition with resources and expertise in water, waste, and energy. Helsingborg also hosts Sweden's first testbed for municipal data - AI Sweden's National City Lab. Living labs and more open innovation arenas are run within various projects. The city development area Oceanhamnen is a living lab for wastewater recycling within the RECO concept. In addition, work is underway to explore opportunities to establish more permanent living lab operations more notably within health care and culture.

The "city as testbed ambition" is realised by close collaboration with researchers, practitioners, and business actors. In 2024 a network for the city's testbeds, living labs and urban transition labs was launched to support and facilitate not only knowledge transfer and synergetic effects but also to strengthen the systematic approach by aligning processes and methodological approaches. In this, we focus on context and capability alike – knowing that the city's testbed capacity is greater than the sum of each individual testbed.

The testbed ecosystem is co-ordinated by a dedicated member of the Department for Innovation and Transformation, ensuring alignment with the city's broader climate neutrality goals. As the city works towards net zero, many of the required actions will likely be trialled within the testbed ecosystem before being scaled up. This allows for controlled testing and refinement, minimising risks and maximising the effectiveness of the solutions.

Actions and projects identified by workgroups are discussed with the testbed co-ordinator to determine where the testbeds can provide the most value. This collaborative approach helps identify the best testing environments for each initiative, ensuring that innovations are thoroughly evaluated and optimised before broader implementation.

## Regional Cooperation and Learning

A regional Learning Hub for "facilitated action learning" is being established jointly by Helsingborg, Malmö, and Lund. Its aim is to support the development of transformative capacity and accelerating the progress of the transition work. Lund University is coordinating the establishment, facilitation, and development of the hub. This regional effort facilitates knowledge-based and practice-oriented exchange of experiences for learning within and between the cities. The work in the hub is grounded in theories of learning pedagogy (Conway, 2023), with iterative efforts aimed at building knowledge, exchanging experiences, and promoting peer learning for reflective learning. The hub is expected to play a central role in achieving progress in key areas of climate transition, and modules will be developed to support the development of, for example, gap analyses, portfolio and design management, reflexive monitoring and learning, directionality and roadmaps, multi-level governance, structures, functions, and processes for closer collaboration with external actors. The choice of themes for the hub's focus will be made continuously in collaboration between the parties. Members of the Transition Team and co-ordinator of emission groups will participate in the learning hub.

## Tailored Stakeholder Engagement

The transition to climate neutrality necessitates a highly coordinated effort across multiple sectors, each with unique stakeholder landscapes and challenges. Effective stakeholder engagement, therefore, cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all approach but must be tailored to the specific needs and dynamics of each sector involved.

In the industrial sector, the focus on transitioning from natural gas to green hydrogen involves a smaller, more specialised group of stakeholders, including large corporations, energy suppliers, and regulatory bodies. Although fewer in number, these stakeholders bring technical complexities that require in-depth
HELSINGBORG

expertise and long-term strategic planning. Engagement here can be more focused and targeted, allowing for detailed discussions, but demands significant technical knowledge and alignment on future visions.

Conversely, the mobility sector presents a much broader and more intricate stakeholder landscape. Achieving climate-neutral transport solutions involves a wide range of actors, from local citizens and businesses to national governments, car manufacturers, and public transport providers. This sector also requires mass behavioural change, significant infrastructure investments, and regulatory coordination at multiple levels of governance. The diversity of stakeholders and the scale of required transformations amplify the complexity of engagement efforts. Here, the city must adopt inclusive, broad-based strategies that foster collaboration across all layers of society and governance.

Acknowledging these distinct dynamics is essential for managing an effective climate transition. The city's approach must be carefully adapted to each sector's specific needs—focusing on precise, technical engagement for specialised industries like energy, while promoting widespread, inclusive participation where public involvement is critical, as seen in transport and mobility. Balancing these different levels of complexity will be crucial to achieving a successful and timely transition to climate neutrality.

To meet the ambitious goal of climate neutrality by 2030, the city will integrate governance innovations that encourage systems thinking and drive impactful change. A key component of this strategy is the formation of a transition team, set to become operational by autumn 2024. This team will play a pivotal role in ensuring horizontal learning across sectors, breaking down silos, and fostering a collaborative, cross-sectoral approach to climate action. By promoting interconnected efforts, the city can maximise synergies, address barriers more holistically, and unlock new opportunities for climate solutions.

At the heart of this strategy is the City of Helsingborg's role as an enabler. The city must provide the frameworks, resources, and platforms that empower all stakeholders—whether public, private, or from civil society—to actively contribute to the climate transition. This enabling role will underpin the entire process, ensuring that governance innovations are translated into tangible, impactful climate actions that drive the city towards its 2030 climate goals.

# Citizen involvement to building a shared understanding

Citizen involvement is a crucial factor in innovation and collaboration, as it brings a diversity of perspectives, creates relevant solutions, increases public support and acceptance, considers the local context, contributes to long-term sustainability, and promotes democratic participation. In recent years, the city has brought together methods for citizen dialogue and service design under the broader concept of "involvement." This approach aims to work more deeply with development and innovation projects together with those we serve, both by listening and by developing and testing solutions to challenges.

Helsingborg's work with community engagement has been developing over recent years. The municipality has worked with leading researchers from the universities of Lund and Linköping and citizens to develop capacity and approaches to meaningful participation. Some of these methods and approaches were tested and developed in conjunction with the H22 sustainable urban development expo in the city. The city also launched its digital dialogue platform in 2021. Together these elements form a strong foundation for a deeper level of community engagement moving into the future in development work in general across the city, but also for the climate transition. As part of the action planning process in the CCC, more detailed community engagement strategies are being developed to drive change in mobility management. This can

range from co-design processes to understand and address barriers to active mobility as well as collaborative communications to design to maximise impact.

# Habiteum

The Division of Environmental Education and Behavioural Influence runs Habiteum, Helsingborg's workshop for quality of life, where the city's administrations and companies, citizens, associations, and businesses co-create for better environmental and public health. In 2024, the division has been tasked with conducting 25 dialogues with Helsingborg's citizens to listen and understand how the residents view the measures and proposals in the new SECAP. The project's implementation gives us the opportunity to genuinely include more people in identifying challenges and finding solutions to address them.

By actively promoting participation, citizens' opportunities for shared ownership of Helsingborg's development are increased. The aim is to create processes for citizen involvement that are built-in, repetitive, and in-depth, to build long-term trust and well-grounded results. By actively involving citizens in the city group's climate actions, strong trust is created, thresholds for co-determination are lowered, and feelings of powerlessness are countered by attributing trust and influence to citizens.

With our climate dialogue sessions, we want to explore how we can democratise the climate transition work in Helsingborg. Ultimately, it is about empowering citizens in the face of the significant climate challenge. The project aims to develop skills, working methods, and routines for citizen involvement as a regular feature of climate work. For many years, behavioural influence has been about the city informing, inspiring, supporting, educating, and training target groups to adopt new desired behaviours. These areas will, of course, continue to be important in the future, but how can we broaden to a more inclusive approach where we systematically use citizens as a resource to understand needs, analyse the current situation, generate ideas, and test solutions? After the project concludes, the goal is to have a long-term strategic plan for how we work with citizens in the city's efforts for climate transition, and to explore how citizen assemblies and the NetZeroCities framework "city as a commons" can be effective tools for participatory governance in Helsingborg's specific context.

As the City of Helsingborg continues to strengthen citizen involvement, children and youth have been identified as a key demographic group. See more in the following chapter on social innovation interventions.

## C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

The City of Helsingborg has identified three transformations that are at the centre of a changing world: the green, the social and the technological. These transformations are a common framework and strategy to reach vision Helsingborg 2035. The aim is to strengthen the organisation's power and ability to make a difference through new collaborations, smarter working methods, and common focus.

Our mission as an organisation is to make society better. Our ability to do difference is fundamentally what social transformation is all about. If we are to succeed, we need to address the fundamental causes of society's challenges and create power for real change. Participation, inclusion, individual and joint responsibility are prerequisites for social transformation. A change that also requires us to see ourselves as enabler of the power and knowledge found in others. The transformations are closely connected, enabling each other.

# Vision Helsingborg 2035

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 9: Vision Helsingborg 2035

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

Helsingborg is aiming for climate neutrality as early as 2030.

Our ability to make a difference where we operate will be decisive, for our generation and for those to come.

Participation, inclusion, individual and joint responsibility are conditions where we together take responsibility for a society where everyone counts, and everyone can succeed.

Taking advantage of the opportunities of technological development is a prerequisite for sustainable development of welfare.

With openness and knowledge, we challenge existing structures, with people's best interests at the center.

The program is aimed at the entire Helsingborg group but is above all a guide for the city's strategists who work with various sustainability issues. The social transformation, together with the Quality-of-Life program functions as an overall umbrella in the city's work with social innovation. Together they aim to overcome systemic barriers, while lowering barriers for marginalised groups to participate in the city's climate action work.

# Social innovation interventions

Behavioural barriers such as putting plastic in residual waste and using the car too much can be partly changed by technical or regulatory solutions, but the city will have much bigger success when the will to change comes from the citizens.

Helsingborg's citizens are worried about threats to life that come with the climate crisis. Because of their concern they are also willing to make necessary changes happen – as a survey showed the citizens are willing to pay more taxes to facilitate measures. Social innovation is an important pathway to nurture strong wills among citizens to contribute to climate neutrality through entrepreneurial endeavours and/or individual actions.

As of now the City of Helsingborg does not have a road map or blueprint specifically for social innovation interventions with a focus on the climate transition, but Vision Helsingborg 2035 and the Quality-of-Life Program provide solid foundation for the next steps. Social transformation is one of the three pillars of Vision Helsingborg 2035. Participation, inclusion, individual and joint responsibility are prerequisites for social transformation, a change that also requires us to see ourselves as enabler of the power and knowledge found in others.

The Quality-of-Life programme establishes that the city's ambition for sustainable development is for all residents to experience a high quality of life, but with a low environmental impact so that people and businesses reach their full potential in long-term sustainable growth, and so that future generations can also experience a good quality of life. The social transformation, together with the Quality-of-Life program functions as an overall umbrella in the city's work with social innovation. Together they aim to overcome systemic barriers, while lowering barriers for marginalised groups to participate in the city's climate action work.

With this policy framework in place and a clear understanding of the transition challenges ahead, not least those requiring behavioural change, the Climate Transition Team will be designing a public engagement and social innovation framework to guide the development of user-friendly solutions. The recently formed Division for Innovation and Transformation will be an important partner in systems design and the development of innovative approaches and solutions. Understanding the challenges of users, citizens and businesses and engaging them in identifying solutions can be key to the success of measures around sustainable consumption, mobility choices or circularity. Strong stakeholder engagement can also support co-benefit development.

As shown in Table C- 2.1 there are many projects and processes with strong social innovation characteristics that have been/are being implemented. Many of them have children and young people as focus. These forward-looking interventions aim to educate, engage, and empower Helsingborg's citizens from a young age. As the city continues to strengthen its portfolio of social innovation interventions it takes inspiration from initiatives such as H22, a major investment in innovation. Earmarked resources used for innovation transformed Helsingborg into a citywide testbed for developing sustainable solutions. By seeking out new and unexpected partnerships – local, national, and global – the city collaborated with residents, businesses, and academia to position Helsingborg as a forerunner in green solutions. As proof of progress, Helsingborg was one of the runners up in iCapital 2020. The Division of Environmental Education and Behavioural Influence runs Habiteum, Helsingborg's workshop for quality of life, where the city's administrations and companies, citizens, associations, and businesses co-create for better environmental and public health. In 2024, the department has been tasked with conducting 25 dialogues with Helsingborg's citizens to listen and understand how the residents view the measures and proposals in the new Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP).

Social innovation is also supported through the 4.7MSEK Research and Development Fund which is a joint initiative with Lund University. Each year, the City of Helsingborg contributes funding for research and development projects that strengthen higher education, research, and collaboration in and around Helsingborg. The purpose of the fund is to enhance research and development cooperation between the City of Helsingborg and Campus Helsingborg. The aim is to increase research-based collaboration between the City and Campus, contribute to research-driven development in line with the city's goals and priorities, such as climate-neutrality 2030 and increased quality of life.

There is therefore a robust organisation with a strong policy framework, organisational capacity, and experience of iterative innovation in sustainable urban development upon which to build a more comprehensive social innovation programme that is integrated into coming iterations of the action plan. It is expected that this will be in place in the spring of 2025.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the CCC Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for refining the CCC Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract in future iterations.

## Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

As the City of Helsingborg embarks on its ambitious journey to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, continuous assessment, adaptive strategies, and robust stakeholder engagement will be key to success. The successful implementation of the CCC hinges on our ability to integrate and evolve key planning instruments, while ensuring the transition is equitable and inclusive.

The forthcoming SECAP, set to be finalised in December 2024, will serve as the cornerstone of our climate action framework for 2025–2030. This plan will outline the strategic measures necessary to reduce emissions across all sectors, including energy, transportation, and waste management. To ensure accountability and track progress, the SECAP will be evaluated every year. These evaluations will allow us to monitor our progress, offering insights into what is working, what is not, and where additional actions may be required. This continuous learning process will form the foundation for future development and iterations of the CCC, which will be updated biannually.

Parallel to the SECAP, the Quality-of-Life Programme will undergo a significant update in 2025. This programme is essential for integrating climate actions with broader social and economic objectives, ensuring that the pursuit of climate neutrality enhances the well-being of all residents. Aligning the Quality-of-Life Programme with the SECAP will foster synergies between environmental sustainability and social equity, reinforcing the city's holistic approach to climate action.

A new SUMP, expected to be finalised in 2025, will address Helsingborg's transportation emissions. The SUMP will prioritise public transit, cycling, and walking, while reducing reliance on fossil-fuel-powered vehicles. Transforming the city's mobility infrastructure is critical to achieving our climate neutrality goals, and the SUMP will be pivotal in shaping this transition.

To operationalise these plans, detailed roadmaps with specific actions and investment strategies for each emission sector will be developed. These roadmaps will provide clear guidance on the necessary steps to meet emission reduction targets, ensuring that every sector contributes effectively to the overall climate neutrality objective.

Recognising the complexity of this transition, Helsingborg will adopt a portfolio approach to prioritise and sequence initiatives. This approach will enable us to allocate resources to projects with the highest impact potential and make informed decisions about where to focus our efforts. Monitoring emissions and tracking the progress of actions and initiatives will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different measures. This reflexive process will help us adapt our strategies as needed, ensuring a dynamic and responsive approach to climate action.

To support this transition, a dedicated Transition Team will be established. This team will orchestrate the various elements of the transition, ensuring that actions are aligned with the overall strategy and that all stakeholders are engaged and informed. The Transition Team will also play a crucial role in ensuring that the move towards climate neutrality is just and equitable, addressing any social or economic disparities that may emerge.

Additionally, a structured process will establish a Transition Arena, a collaborative platform where government, industry, academia, and civil society can come together. This arena will encourage dialogue, innovation, and co-creation, ensuring that the transition benefits from diverse perspectives and that all voices are heard.

The development of these plans, combined with the establishment of a robust governance structure, will lay the foundation for future iterations of the Climate City Contract. As we progress, a reflexive approach—continuously learning from successes and setbacks—will allow us to refine and adjust our strategies in response to emerging challenges and opportunities. This flexibility is essential to keeping Helsingborg on track to meet its climate neutrality goals by 2030.

# 1. Introduction

Helsingborg has committed to becoming climate neutral by 2030. We have signed a Climate Contract with national authorities in Sweden, as part of the Climate Neutral Cities 2030, run by Viable Cities. Helsingborg is also recognised as one of EU's strategic 100 (+12) Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030. We are now submitting an updated version of our Climate City Contract (CCC).

Through the Cities Mission, we are fully committed to our ongoing multi-stakeholder engagement and actions. In doing so, we can effectively develop and prioritise actions that will accelerate our transition to a climate-neutral society. Being part of the 100 (+12) Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities is providing us with an impact-driven template to explore new partnerships, new funding opportunities and new collaborations between cities, as well as business, academia, and the civil society.

It therefore explores evidence, ideas, and action well beyond our city boundaries.

The City of Helsingborg is the eighth largest city in Sweden. Geographically, the city is well-placed to service critical freight and logistics requirements of Scandinavia and has a thriving port, freight, and logistics industry. Nationally, Helsingborg plays a leading role in innovation and business and within the tech community and is a vibrant place to live and work, with the innovation district and the new urban renewal area (H+) acting as a draw card to new tech businesses.

Since 1990, emissions in Helsingborg have fallen by 55%, evidencing the city's longstanding work but also need to increase the pace of transition (see page 3 for the track record of completed emission reduction measures). The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) for 2018–2024 addresses crucial points of action for achieving a climate transition by 2035. It is fully endorsed by all municipal committees, and all companies and utilities owned by the city. Its goals on emission targets serve also as steering goals in other municipal processes and documents.

A new and updated SECAP has been drafted during 2023 and has been out for consultation during spring 2024. The new SECAP will reset Helsingborg's goal and raise our ambition of being climate neutral from 2035 to 2030. The development of the new SECAP has been an inclusive process, with a broad group of stakeholders, endorsed by the same group of actors who will be endorsing the final CCC.

The objective of this document is to clarify Helsingborg's commitments to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The combined action and investment plan in this CCC
should be read as a proposal for intended actions to achieve climate neutrality. The SECAP, that will be adopted at the end of 2024, sets targets broken down at the municipality's emissions sectors. In the work to implement the plan, which will commence in the autumn of 2024, measures to achieve the targets will be specified and prioritised.

In September 2022, Sweden held municipal elections and the political majority in Helsingborg's city council confirmed capacity building for collaborative innovation and Climate Neutrality by 2030 as one of the four top priorities for the ongoing mandate-period. With political unity and a genuine commitment to high targets and ambitions, the City of Helsingborg and its leading stakeholders in the local innovation ecosystem are mobilising to become one of the first cities to reach climate neutrality by 2030.

The city recognises that the challenges ahead are substantial and will meet them with effective mobilisation of citizen engagement, stakeholders, digitalisation efforts, and large-scale investments.

# 2. Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Helsingborg is a climate-conscious city with the ambition to become climate neutral by 2030, as defined and pursued by the Cities Mission. This includes the entire geographic area of the municipality, without any exceptions. There is a total of two ETS facilities within the geographical boundary of the city, both included in the climate neutrality target.

During 2023 Helsingborg has developed its new Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP). The existing SECAP is valid until 2024. Since the plan was adopted in 2018, the city of Helsingborg has sharpened its ambition for net zero emissions within the geographical area towards the goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

For Helsingborg to reach its long-term climate goals, it is required that emissions decrease at a significantly faster rate than they have done to date. The new SECAP is proposed to apply from 2025-2030 and will contain stronger targets that correspond to the content in the national Swedish Climate Contract 2030 as well as the Climate City Contract (CCC). The plan will cover emissions within the geographic area of the municipality, as well as the emissions caused by those who live, work, and stay in Helsingborg regardless of where the emissions occur.

We aim to play an active role in mitigating climate change and create a sustainable future. Not only do we endeavour to generate collective responsibility at the local level, but we also want to set an example globally. In accordance with the Paris Agreement, we are working to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, while simultaneously adapting how we use the planet's resources. Since 1990, greenhouse gas emissions in Helsingborg have decreased by 55%, compared to the corresponding national figure of 35%.

To ensure a holistic approach to climate change, Helsingborg is using the Climate OS platform, developed by ClimateView, which breaks down the advanced interconnected systems of the city into manageable transition elements. Climate OS shows the impact of possible solutions on carbon abatement, a great basis for discussion and decisions about which measures the city should adopt. We are currently exploring how to use the platform to connect our stakeholder groups to co-create solutions and actions.

Possible co-benefits and adverse impacts generated by local scale climate mitigation policies have briefly been assessed in the SECAP from 2018 as well as the Quality-of-Life Programme from 2021. In 2018 an overall impact assessment was carried out of what consequences the implementation of Helsingborg's SECAP will have from an economic perspective, an environmental perspective, and a social perspective.
In the development of Helsingborg's new SECAP (to be decided in December 2024, valid 2025 – 2030), an analysis of the social dimension in the plan has been carried out by two researchers. They identified three important conditions in the implementation of the plan:

The climate transition must address social disparities to improve quality of life for all.
Participation from all social groups and stakeholders is crucial for social sustainability and climate neutrality.
Helsingborg holds structural power to influence societal development through its climate policies and collaboration with various stakeholders.

In the Quality-of-Life Programme, the road to climate neutrality is briefly summarised, stating among other things that actions to mitigate climate change, resource management and circular systems and economy create new opportunities for job creation. The programme also mentions the importance of creating a more resilient society, a society that can prevent, resist, manage and recover from disturbances.

Increasing climate action and reducing reliance on fossil fuels can bring numerous co-benefits to Helsingborg. These co-benefits cover economic, social, and environmental aspects of sustainability, and include job creation, reduced energy costs, improved public health, increased competitiveness, a more sustainable and liveable city, enhanced social equity, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity conservation, and resource conservation.

Working towards climate neutrality goals can help Helsingborg achieve various co-benefits, including improving the well-being and health of residents, promoting social equity and justice, achieving financial savings through lower energy costs, and preserving the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting biodiversity. Therefore, it is important for Helsingborg to prioritise climate action and transition to a low-carbon economy to achieve these co-benefits and create a just and sustainable future for all.

# 3. Strategic priorities

Below follows a description of Helsingborg's largest sources of emissions, making it particularly important to devise measures to achieve reductions within these areas, while measures within other areas will also be developed.

Sustainable transport and mobility, implementing a diverse set of measures to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
Electricity and district heating production.
Reduced emissions from industry, mainly natural gas use.

Priority measures in the near term to reduce emissions from transport include the development of a new Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan. The plan will include new goals, clear prioritisations, and trade-offs between different measures. The plan is expected to be finalised by 2025.

In the climate and energy plan currently under consultation, the City of Helsingborg intends to support the formation of a local hydrogen cluster in and around Helsingborg. The benefit of this would be that hydrogen, produced using renewable electricity, could replace much of the natural gas that the industry in Helsingborg currently relies on. This, in turn, would promote the city's goal of achieving climate neutrality, with the target of reaching net zero emissions by 2030.

Furthermore, the industrial and transport sectors today are calling for sustainable alternatives to the current fossil energy carriers and are actively seeking collaborations and locations that offer the conditions for such a transition. Therefore, an investment in hydrogen, provided it can be made available in a cost-effective manner, would serve as a driver for the city's competitiveness and attractiveness.

While emissions must be reduced to the greatest extent possible, development and implementation of compensatory measures need to take place in parallel, such as biological and technological carbon sequestration. Equipping the district heating plant Filbornaverket with a CCS-system to capture fossil emissions from the burning of waste is a necessary climate action to continue managing society's residual waste and deliver sustainable energy. Investment decisions for the facility are planned to be taken by the municipal assembly in April 2025.

To achieve climate neutrality, the municipality, together with other stakeholders, must accelerate the pace of its transition efforts. We need to reduce emissions by an average of approximately 40,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents each year—
more than four times the rate at which emissions decreased from 1990 to 2021. This means that both the municipality and other stakeholders in the transition must significantly increase their efforts.

To enable large-scale change, we must also build transformational capacity within the organisation as well as with other stakeholders. Emissions that are not directly caused by the city of Helsingborg can be managed by processes and decisions enabled by city officials, as well as joint actions for regulation together with key stakeholders, such as residents, businesses, regional and national governments as well as international organisations.

To ensure that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced at the required rate, the city must focus on mobilising stakeholders and financial support, as well as co-creating actions and solutions with key stakeholders and residents to build transformational capacity. By clearly connecting measures for the climate with measures for a higher quality of life, the transition towards a climate-neutral society will also mean a better and more sustainable Helsingborg to live and work in. The process of going about this is very important and a crucial aspect of our city-wide approach of mobilising actors and build common capacity and understanding.

# 4. Process and principles

For several decades, Helsingborg has worked to systematically reduce environmental and climate impact. A framework of Council adopted programmes and plans for climate change and adaptation, waste management and Quality-of-Life are in place, although always in a dynamic process of upgrading. To plan, act and follow up is in the city's DNA. The city possesses extensive environmental expertise across its administrations and municipal companies. Additionally, there is broad political consensus regarding the environmental challenges we face and the need for transition. This consensus has long supported a shared vision and enabled sustained investments towards achieving climate neutrality.

The environmental work is monitored annually as part of the city's financial statements. Key environmental indicators like quality of air, marine fauna, waste, use of fossil fuel and climate impact are annually updated. We annually report to regional and national authorities. This includes the follow up on national environmental objectives. This allows us a process of reviewing performance across a wide range of groups and looking for ways to upgrade, amend and redesign actions to improve.

Now, Helsingborg is building upon these capacities and directing efforts towards achieving climate neutrality by 2030. As part of this, we are reorganising and strengthening our internal teams working with transformation and mission-oriented innovation. This is being done across multiple departments in the city, ensuring that we have resources and capacity across the whole organisation.

In 2023, the city also has launched a new department for innovation and transformation, working to further strengthen and support the innovation capacity of the city and finding models to accelerate scale up and initiate/strengthen the ongoing innovation-partnerships in the whole innovation ecosystem of the city, including focused research-programmes. This overarching function will develop, support, and manage programmes and portfolios for larger and complex innovation projects within the city's climate neutrality work.

Simultaneously, we are developing collaborative arenas and platforms, testbeds, tools, and programmes to engage with citizens, businesses, academia, and other public sector actors. We believe these efforts will foster new collaborations and genuine co-creation, promote mission-oriented innovation and, ultimately, accelerate our transition toward climate neutrality by 2030.

## Monitoring and updating the CCC

To ensure that the CCC remains aligned with the latest scientific knowledge and technological advancements, and has the greatest possible impact within the city, the plan will be reviewed every two years. This work also includes identifying potential additional measures and/or information that accelerate climate transition. By clarifying the steps required to create a comprehensive overview of actions and
investments for Helsingborg's climate transition, we also highlight how we need to work to achieve climate neutrality.

## Citizen engagement

We must bring people together with the goal of building trust and gaining support from the residents, while also emphasising a sense of responsibility. By inviting Helsingborg's community to examine the municipality's climate goals and climate work, we highlight where citizens themselves can influence their emissions, and in which emission areas the city is responsible.

By establishing processes for community involvement that are integrated, repeated, and thorough, we can build long-term trust and firmly anchored results. By actively involving our residents in the city and broader stakeholder climate work, we create a strong sense of trust, lower the barriers to participation, and counter feelings of powerlessness by entrusting residents with trust and influence.

We continuously work on citizen engagement in various processes in the city, especially related to the construction or redevelopment of residential areas - which has a significant impact on the climate. This type of input is of great benefit in the development of the city's Sustainable Climate and Energy Plan (SECAP), as well as the subsequent Climate City Contract.

In line with the recently developed SECAP it is crucial that messages about the necessary transition are rooted in the local reality where the consequences of the climate crisis and the need for transition are clear. Residents' carbon emissions vary from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. By analysing factors such as age, income, education level, and gender in relation to neighbourhoods, the municipality can prioritise which groups are most important to reach to have the greatest impact on emission reduction but also to cultivate engagement among different segments of the population.

In accordance with a political decision, the residents of Helsingborg will be actively engaged with in climate action. This engagement seeks to involve citizens in shaping and driving the transition towards climate neutrality. By focusing on their opportunities, needs, and willingness to contribute, the aim is to harness collective efforts to accelerate the city's climate transition. Citizens from various neighbourhoods and age groups are involved to ensure broad and inclusive participation, ensuring that the city's climate strategy reflects the diversity of its population.

## Stakeholder engagement and mission-oriented innovation

The City of Helsingborg has limited control over emissions that occur within the municipality's geographical boundaries. To successfully achieve climate neutrality, it is of utmost importance that we collaborate with other stakeholders. During 2023, representatives from the business sector, academia, and civil society have been
invited to several workshops to work together with the city to identify how and where we can support each stakeholder's climate efforts, as well as important measures for the city itself as part of developing the new SECAP.

We also have a strong focus to engage and form partnerships with the business community to accelerate transition towards climate neutrality. We collaborate with the business community within the Helsingborg Declaration and the Helsingborg Climate Agreement, two initiatives where companies come together to drive transition efforts. The Helsingborg Declaration is an initiative where the city works together with stakeholders from the entire logistics chain to develop the Helsingborg region into Europe's most sustainable and fast-moving logistics hub. Businesses and associations who have signed the Helsingborg Climate Agreement support the goal of a climate neutral Helsingborg 2030 by actively reducing their emissions as quickly as possible.

In Helsingborg, the city and municipal companies offer various testbeds where innovative solutions and approaches within water and sewage, waste management, biochar, renewable energy, and sustainable construction enable new opportunities and job prospects.

An Innovation District was established in 2023 by existing pivotal businesses, municipal companies, the Helsingborg Campus of Lund university, and the city. Circularity, e-commerce, building and construction industries, urban logistics as well as a growing start-up community of tech are involved and enrolled in the community of the Helsingborg innovation District. Much of the focus offered from the city in the Helsingborg Innovation District is aimed at businesses that can support the making of a smarter and more sustainable Helsingborg.

Helsingborg has a strong tradition of multi-stakeholder approaches to innovation and development towards sustainability. This is a strong foundation on which to build for a successful acceleration of the climate transition process, not least when many of the critical decisions, changes and investments will need to be made by local businesses and local people. The commitment of the city, its political leaders and business, academic and civil society partners are a key strength our transition work, and the climate transition can strengthen these ties further.
