# Summary

Climate action is at the heart of an ambitious vision for the future of Cork. The National Development Plan envisages Cork as the fastest growing city in Ireland up to 2040. The city is benefitting from rapidly growing FDI and significant public sector investment. At the same time, Cork is particularly vulnerable to the extreme impacts of climate change. Flooding has been a recurrent theme in our city's history. While our resilience is growing, we have firsthand experience of climate induced hazards and the multi-dimensional costs incurred.

Cork City Council's vision: Cork City is transforming into a climate neutral and resilient city. We are rapidly becoming a fairer, healthier, more economically vibrant, and more sustainable place to live, work and do business.

Cork City has established three inter-linked goals for 2030:

Achieve net-zero GHG emissions in line with the EU's Climate -Neutral and Smart Cities Mission's objective, which we consider a minimum of an 80% emissions reduction over 2018 baseline levels.
Protect and enhance our natural and built environment for future generations, and
Establish best-practice governance to lead the city into a sustainable and prosperous future.

The outcome of our work in 2023 was the Cork City Climate Action Plan 2024-2029 (CAP) and annex of actions which was adopted by the City Council in February 2024. It describes the city-level actions to achieve the National Climate Ambition, set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act, 2021, of a 51% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030. Our approach is to integrate actions that help the city to mitigate emissions and adapt to climate change.

The Cork City CAP is incorporated into our Cork City 2030 CNAP providing measures to achieve 51% of emissions reduction in the city by 2030. The CCC builds on this foundation to achieve the more ambitious net zero city goal. Our CAP establishes enabling conditions for action in key sectors and redoubles our commitment to accelerate implementation in those sectors. The CCC extends the impact of the CAP by identifying gaps and addressing some of the more challenging policy areas needed to achieve net-zero.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

The CCC has identified five priority themes and their specific objectives:

## Governance &amp; Leadership

Our community will work together through an inclusive and accountable governance structure to achieve a fair climate transition that leaves no one behind.
A governance structure that engages people living and working in the city and supports them in gaining knowledge and acting, individually and collectively, in ways that protect and enhance our climate and environment.

## Communities &amp; Partnership

Climate action will be mainstreamed in all areas of community development, including for youth, gender, poverty and social inclusion, integration, health, arts, and travel, among others.
The diverse community groups in Cork City will play a significant role in climate action, achieving a fair and inclusive transition.
The City Council and other institutions will facilitate individuals and community groups to act.

## Built Environment &amp; Energy

Institutions and building owners in Cork City will work together to accelerate retrofitting and the installation of renewable energy systems.
Innovation will be de-risked for building owners and effectively tested in the city and, where successful, will be rapidly scaled up.
The expansion zones and regeneration areas are flagship, climate-positive development projects that integrate our policies and good practices set out in the City Development Plan, the Green and Blue Infrastructure Strategy, and the Trees Strategy, among others.

## Transport &amp; Mobility

People living and working in Cork City will avail of an excellent sustainable public transport system and accessible, safe active-travel routes, using a car as a last resort.
Provision of multi-modal sustainable transport options for everyone.
Reduced car ownership and significantly reduced car use in the city.

## Natural Environment &amp; Resource Management

Green space will be easily accessible on foot by all residents.
The potential for carbon sequestration, nature and biodiversity gain, and climate-risk mitigation through green and blue infrastructure will be maximised in every new development and established neighbourhood.
The city will adopt the reduce-reuse-recycle principle of a circular economy.

Figure 1: Relationship between the Cork City CAP and CCC

Cork's CCC is a principled plan. It builds on the 2019 Climate Action Charter. While this plan supersedes some of the specific clauses of the Charter, its commitment to a participatory approach that includes residents' voices, strong partnerships including with business and academia, and the mainstreaming of climate action in all our work, such as planning and regulation, and effective monitoring and evaluation, remain highly relevant.

# Our principles are:

Cork City residents support climate action. Our proposals will be bold and ambitious. Business as usual will not be enough. We will ensure citizens are at the heart of decision-making throughout the transition.
We will take risks through innovation and learn from our mistakes.
Our transition to net zero will be fair. It will help the most vulnerable groups in the city so that climate action does not push them further behind.
We will seek out creative and high-impact partnerships with our community organisations, businesses, and academic institutions, among others, to drive and accelerate progress.

These principles are established in the Cork City CAP 2024-2029, adopted by the City Council in February 2024. Stakeholders' willingness to engage and our shared principles will be applied consistently throughout the implementation of the CCC.

# Introduction

The introduction outlines the local geographic and policy context in which the city's 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CNAP) is being developed and describes the gap it addresses in broad terms. It includes:

The administrative territories included in the city's 2030 climate neutrality target. Where applicable, any districts or emission sources within these administrative boundaries that are excluded from the target of climate neutrality by 2030¹. Table I-1.1 summarizes this narrative in a snapshot.
Key data on the administrative and political organisation of the city, its demographic and socio-economic characteristics, and climate-relevant sectors.
A clear description of the relationship of this CCC Action Plan with existing climate policies and strategies (further detailed in Module A-2), and how it builds on them to address the gap (if any) to climate neutrality.
Background information on the work process of developing the city's CCC Action Plan, highlighting its connection with the other Climate City Contract components (2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments and 2030 Climate Neutrality Investment Plan).
A description of future steps planned timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the CCC Action Plan.

¹ By default, the participating city would commit the whole city or entity to become climate-neutral. However, where duly justified, the city may propose to exclude one or more district(s) or sources of emissions from the 2030 deadline, but in this case should commit to a strategy of climate neutrality for these districts as soon as possible, and of course no later than 2050. In this context, districts will be considered as neighbourhoods or zones of special interest of a city administered or governed by some type of "district council".

# Introduction

Cork is Ireland's second city. It is a dynamic, rapidly growing city that serves as the economic, social and cultural hub for South and Southwestern Ireland. The 2022 Census reported a population of approximately 222,000. The Cork City Development Plan 2022-2028 (CDP) projects that the population will grow to approximately 340,000 by 2040. The city is the fastest growing in Ireland and is the second-largest English-speaking city in the EU. It has experienced notable levels of foreign direct investment in recent years and is amid a transformational decade which will see huge investment in its transport infrastructure, housing stock, and public realm. The CDP places sustainability and climate resilience at the top of its priorities, to be achieved through compact development and the achievement of 15-minute neighbourhoods. Cork City's climate actions will be fully aligned with the CDP.

Cork City is centred on former marshland in the Lee Valley. It is highly vulnerable to pluvial, fluvial, and tidal flooding. Its building stock, especially in the historic core, is not well adapted to extremes of temperature. Its assets include a major port and international airport. Cork City's economy is diverse and vibrant, with over 190 multinational companies present, with concentrations in ICT, life sciences, international services and business services, among others. Inward investment is attracted to the pool of multi-disciplinary talent coming from the city's two major universities. While Cork is Ireland's fastest growing city, contributing 19% of Ireland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and having the 4th highest disposable income per capita in the country, the POBAL Deprivation Index, mapped in Figure 2 below, does show the city contains many areas of socio-economic disadvantage, with corresponding vulnerability to climate change.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 2: POBAL Deprivation Index 2022

Through Cork City's participation in the EU funded REACHOUT project, a Socio-Economic Vulnerability Index, drawing on 2022 census data, has been created by our partners at University College Cork (UCC). The index uses multi-dimensional criteria to assess vulnerability. When mapped by small area, it is possible to see where the most climate vulnerable areas of the city are located, as seen in figure 3.

# Alignment:

Climate Action in Ireland is driven and informed by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act of 2021. The act established the National Climate Ambition to transition to a climate resilient, biodiversity rich, environmentally sustainable and climate neutral economy no later than 2050. The act establishes sectoral emissions ceilings, carbon budgets, annual climate action plans, a long-term emissions reduction strategy and a national adaptation framework as the tools to achieve the national ambition. An interim target of a  $51\%$  emissions reduction over a 2018 baseline was established by the act, in line with EU Climate Law and the IPCC's  $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  pathway. The independent CCAC, a statutory body established to review progress on implementation of the act and its instruments, reported in its annual report for 2023 that "at the current rate of policy implementation, Ireland will not meet the targets set in the first and second carbon budget periods unless urgent action is taken immediately and emissions begin to fall much more rapidly".

In February 2024 the Cork City CAP 2024-2029 (CAP) was formally adopted by the City Council. In 2021 the National CAP required all Local Authorities to prepare a local-level 5-year CAP, including both mitigation and adaptation measures, and to develop a decarbonisation zone to test mitigation and other measures. The CAP brings together new and existing policy actions from across the City Council's functional areas, and The Cork City CAP, the first in the city's history, has three goals:

To achieve net-zero GHG emissions as soon as possible, in line with the EU's Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission's objective, by identifying and testing approaches to acceleration in all five thematic areas.

Protect and enhance our **natural and built environment** for future generations.

Establish **best-practice governance** to lead the city into a sustainable and prosperous future.

The CAP groups 129 actions into five themes, which constitute our strategic priorities: governance and leadership; communities and partnerships; the built environment and energy; transport and mobility; and the natural environment and resource management. Implementation will be undertaken while observing four core principles:

**Cork City residents support climate action.** Our proposals will be bold and ambitious. Business as usual will not be enough.
We will take risks through **innovation** and **learn from our mistakes**.
**Our transition to net zero will be fair.** It will help the most vulnerable groups in the city so that climate action does not push them further behind.
We will seek out **creative and high-impact partnerships** with our community organisations, businesses, and academic institutions, among others, to drive and accelerate progress.

Cork City joined the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission in 2022 to signal its ambition to achieve net zero emissions as quickly as possible, and to avail of the significant learning opportunities associated with participation in the Mission. Cork City also joined the EU Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and to Restore our Oceans and Waters, around the same time.

The Cork Climate City Contract (CCC) builds on the foundation of the CAP and extends its ambition to the achievement of net-zero GHG emissions by 2030 target. The CCC identifies sectors and activities where the need for decarbonisation exists, but where the city has not yet fully specified its implementation strategy and expected emissions reduction impact. Future iterations of the CCC will specify both. The relationship between the Cork City CAP and the CCC is shown below in Figure 1.

Cork City Council's vision is that "Cork City is transforming into a climate neutral and resilient city. We are rapidly becoming a fairer, healthier, more economically vibrant, and more sustainable place to live, work and do business". Our elected representatives are committed to the achievement of this vision. The City's first CAP was unanimously adopted on February  $12^{\text{th}}$ , 2024. The city is home to a diverse array of stakeholders in business, the public sector, academia, and community organisations all forging towards a more sustainable and climate neutral future, and with strong support from the public, who are demanding that action is taken. We are working together to achieve climate neutrality as soon as possible. Our target it to achieve a minimum of an  $80\%$  emissions reduction over 2018 baseline levels by 2030. This target is consistent with, but more specific, than our EOI.

There are two specific exclusions from this plan. Flights from Cork City Airport and navigation of ships entering and leaving the Port of Cork, both of which currently sit within the city boundary, are excluded from the calculations in Cork City's Baseline Emissions Inventory (BEI). There is no currently available methodology for calculating these emissions on a small area basis. It is noted that Cork International Airport is implementing a sustainability strategy to achieve net zero emissions in the operation of its terminal and campus well in advance of 2050. Flight emissions are included in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and are governed, in Ireland, by the Environmental Protection Authority. The Port of Cork is in the process of implementing its masterplan for 2050. This plan will see the movement of its operations out of the Cork City boundary to the Lower Harbour area. The City Quays Facility will have moved by 2028 and the Tivoli Docks will move between 2030 and 2040. We intend to address port related emissions in future iterations of the CCC.

Cork City has been implementing both public and private measures to reduce emissions prior to joining the Cities Mission or the adoption of our first CAP. In the privately-owned housing sector, for example, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) report that as of 29/02/2024 nearly 10% of stock (5,234 of 57,438 buildings) has undertaken retrofitting work and received €19,880,540 of public incentives to act. As a result, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) estimates that 14.82% of private homes meet the Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 or above (&lt;100 kWh/m²/year), which SEAI consider the cost-optimal standard for retrofitting. Cork City Council owns approximately 11500 social housing units in the city. The City Council retrofitting programme has, so far, completed 900 units to a BER B2 standard, and plans to complete 2750 units by 2030, approximately 25% of the publicly owned housing stock, notwithstanding systemic constraints on contractor availability and capacity. The Irish Government has committed to retrofit all social housing by 2050. Cork City Council has also constructed 66 km of cycle infrastructure in the city and achieved the National Transport Authority's (NTA) Active Travel Mark. We achieved a 44% reduction in gas use and a 50% reduction in electricity use due to energy efficiency upgrades at Bishopstown Leisure Centre in 2022, one of the City Council's biggest energy users.

Cork City has developed and utilised a work process that mirrors elements of the Net Zero Cities (NZC) Climate Transition Map. The process has been instrumental in the development of the Cork City CAP 2024-2029, as follows:

## Building a strong mandate: (C &amp; C Checklist 8)

In 2019 Cork City Council unanimously adopted a resolution declaring a climate and biodiversity emergency in the city and the establishment of a cross-party Climate Action Committee (CAC) to scrutinise city-level climate policy. The Committee has met monthly since 2019, demonstrating a strong and quite unified commitment to transition among elected members.

In 2023 Cork City Council undertook a household survey of behaviours and attitudes to climate change in the city. 509 face-to-face interviews took place across a representative sample of the city's population. The survey found that 86% of respondents supported the statement that Cork City must transform into a more sustainable place to live and work that is climate neutral and resilient. This is consistent with findings from the national level Climate Change in the Irish Mind wave 2 study of 2024.

The city's first CAP was opened to public consultation in November 2023. 72 submissions were made, of which 71 were positive in support of the plan, and with many urging faster and more ambitious action.

Taken together, these measures provide evidence of a strong mandate for change in Cork City. This is also reflected by the diverse and committed participation in the Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group, the governance mechanism established to design and deliver our net zero ambition. There is a strong consensus that, based on the evidence below, our strategic objectives are the right ones.

The Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group is made up of representatives of a wide variety of engaged stakeholders that have a shared interest in building a thriving, sustainable, and resilient city.

## Understanding the system:

The CAP was built on a robust evidence base that included a baseline emissions inventory (BEI), and a climate change risk assessment. It is important to note that our BEI shows a significant increase in emissions over the figures stated in our initial expression of interest (+239 kt CO₂ eq, for the following reasons):

In 2019 the Cork City Council boundary was extended to five times its 2011 size and to incorporate approximately 85,000 additional people.
EOI was based on 2011 data, BEI on 2018 data, but incorporating the extended city boundary.
The methodology used in 2018 had evolved and incorporated public services, agriculture, LULUCF, and fishing, and waste handling and treatment sectors.

Using 2018 baseline data the emissions inventory found that Cork City emitted a total of 987 kt CO₂ eq. The most significant sectors were household emissions, 34% of the total (332 kt CO₂ eq), road transport at 29% of the total (290 kt CO₂ eq), and commercial or industrial buildings at 22% of the total emissions (216 kt CO₂ eq). Public services, which the City Council's assets, development activities and operations are a part, contributed 7% of emissions, or 65 kt CO₂ eq. Cork's GHG emissions are overwhelmingly from the private assets and activities of citizens and private sector entities of all kinds. Per capita emissions were assessed to be approximately 4.7 tonnes CO₂ eq relative to the national average, in 2018, of 14.4 tonnes CO₂ eq per capita. This is largely attributable to the limited

agricultural and industrial emissions within the city boundary. The city population in 2018 was approximately 210,000.

The Climate change risk assessment projected, out to 2050, increased frequency and intensity of all types of flood risk (pluvial, fluvial and tidal), heatwaves and droughts. These hazards were expected to cause increased loss and damage to the city's finances, heritage, society, and reputation, among other assessed factors. The Cork City climate change risk assessment does not evaluate risk relative to assessed vulnerability, but we expect to integrate risk and vulnerability assessment in future iterations. Our partners at University College Cork have developed a socio-economic vulnerability index utilising 2022 census data under the EU funded REACHOUT project to assist with this.

Extensive consultation through a series of Climate Conversations, with over 1000 individuals representing stakeholders from the business community, elected representatives, public sector institutions, the community development sector, children and young people were held in May and June 2023. A summary for ease of access to information was also published. The Cork City CAP sets out the steps to take at the local level that will achieve, and in our case exceed, the national climate ambition by 2030. Contributions to the climate conversations helped to shape the Cork City CAP, in tone, in ambition and in the principles that underpinned it, including the mandate to act, the centrality of climate justice, the risk appetite necessary to innovate and take risks, and the demand for new, deeper and higher impact partnerships across the city.

Following the publication of the first CAP in November, the public were consulted again. 72 submissions that led to the inclusion of 10 new actions and amendments to 7 other actions. Overall, the submissions made during public consultation were strongly supportive of climate action and the goals set out, with most submissions making the case to increase ambition. The Cork City CAP was adopted by the full City Council on February 12th 2024, and given its public launch on March 22nd 2024.

Cork City Council will repeat the climate conversations with citizens and stakeholder groups throughout the city when preparing bi-annual updates to the plan. Furthermore, we are mainstreaming the climate action discourse in established mechanisms, including the apparatus developed as part of the City's designation as a UNESCO Learning City and as a WHO Healthy City, among others (see section C below). We have committed, within our plan, to investigate and test novel forms of engagement with citizens, for example through citizen juries and participatory budgeting, to increase citizen participation in decision-making for climate action, which will help to further strengthen the mandate for change. We are still investigating which options might work best for Cork and so are not ready to define structures, scale, budgets or other operational aspects of these engagement processes. This will be clarified in the second iteration of the CCC in 2026.

Cork City Council is now working with partners and stakeholders across the city to secure Commitments to the Net Zero Transition. We have already secured commitments to the CCC from most members of our Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group and from the Department of Environment and Climate Change at the central government level. We are developing commitments with the business community, academic institutions, public sector institutions and community-based organisations. As a participant in the Intelligent Cities Challenge 2.0 (ICC), we are utilising the ICC format for local green deals to document commitments to the Mission objectives and as a means to bundle bankable projects led by different stakeholders into investment-ready portfolios.

Cork City Council has put in place an inclusive governance mechanism to contribute to and support the citywide transition that will work alongside the well-established internal management structures that have been put in place over the past five years, shown in Figure 7 below. The Structure provides for a city-wide Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group comprising experts and leaders from a wide-range of entities in the city - academia, business, public sector and community. The Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group is chaired by the Chief Executive, Cork City Council. Its role is threefold - to harness their organisations to the movement for net zero transition in the city, to amplify the work being planned and delivered, to review progress towards net zero and

to suggest ways to accelerate progress. The City's elected representatives, who are members of the City Council's CAC, review net zero policy and actions, provide input into policy implementation, and help to mobilise and inform their communities of progress and challenges.

In Ireland multi-level governance is critical. The Irish governance model is more centralised than in many other EU member states, so Local Authorities must work closely with central government departments to develop and test innovative new ways of working. Currently, central government largely determine how resources are invested. In 2018, for example, only around  $9\%$  of total government expenditure was made by Local Authorities, one of the lowest levels in Europe. The Irish Government committed, in the National Climate Action Plan 2023, to support the two Irish Mission Cities, Cork and Dublin, through the establishment of a National Mirror Group comprising multiple departments to coordinate support for the cities.

# 4.3.5. The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will coordinate engagement across Departments to bring together an interdepartmental group to oversee the Cities Mission and to ensure that the necessary support is provided to the participating cities - Dublin and Cork.

Supporting city level innovation through enhanced policy coherence and financial support for new approaches will be critical to the success of the mission in Cork City.

We are planning to start a public platform, provisionally named Climate Neutral Cork, which will provide information services and knowledge exchange of the city's climate actions to the public and to engaged stakeholders. The platform is envisaged as a website that will also organise real-world events to provide opportunities to network and collaborate, recognise progress and learn from experience. The platform will provide the means for the whole community to be informed, to make their voices heard, and to co-create initiatives of different kinds to accelerate progress. The implementation model is still to be determined. We expect to launch the platform in 2025.

# Cork City is starting out on its journey towards net zero.

It is our intention to make rapid progress on decarbonisation and to achieve net zero by 2030. We have many projects in development or being implemented today, and many more opportunities to explore and implement. The first iteration of our CCC builds on our CAP and states what we already have planned or ongoing. It identifies the main sectors where decarbonisation at scale is essential, but where we currently lack data, specific plans and capacity to implement all needed measures. In future iterations of the plan, we will progressively specify the actions, costs and implementation strategies to address them. We will update this plan in 2026, and every two years from then on, with substantive input from the Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group and its sub-groups. The CAC of the City Council will maintain its oversight and contribution. The revised plans will be developed in a coordinated manner through standing membership of the internal Climate Action Team, with support from the City Council's Climate Action Unit.

Table I-1.1 (C &amp; C Checklist 12) sets out the emissions sectors included in our plan, and the exclusions. These are for scope 1 and 2 emissions, which are taken together rather than differentiated. Our calculation incorporated the rapid projected population growth expected in Cork. As the fastest growing city / region in Ireland, the National Planning Framework projects our population to be 353,583 by 2040. For planning purposes, our CDP projects 2031 population to reach 286,178. For the purposes of the CCC we are expecting our population to be 280,000 in 2030. We have incorporated this population growth into the sectoral emissions on a business-as-usual basis for 2030 and calculate both the per capita and gross emissions reductions in each sector from there.

# 1.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Module A-1 "Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory" details and describes the latest GHG inventory, where available from 2018 or more recent, referring to a clearly stated geographic boundary. The aim of this section is to establish the emission baseline and to establish the emissions gap to 2030 climate neutrality according to the inventory specifications defined in the Cities Mission's Info Kit for Cities² and the process outlined in the CCC Action Plan Guidance and Explanations. It includes:

Definition of geographic boundary of the GHG inventory and, if applicable, excluded areas, sectors, scopes, sources, gases.
An explanation of any (current) mismatch between the boundary of the GHG inventory and the climate-neutrality target, including actions planned to address the mismatch.
Key data and visualisation of the latest GHG inventory (ideally not older than 2018), according to the coverage (source sectors, scopes, and gases) specified in the Mission's "Info Kit for Cities" to establish the emission baseline. If additional inventories are used in the CNAP, the same information should be provided for all inventories.
Descriptive assessment of current GHG inventory, including a description of the current state of each emitting sector.
Where a BAU scenario is used as baseline, a description of methodology and assumptions (for instance, which sectors/sources/gases are actually modelled; locally specific input variables vs. national or default data, etc.).

# GhG Emissions Baseline inventory

In Ireland, the government established a statutory requirement for all Local Authorities to produce local level Climate Action Plans to be adopted by February 2024. General guidance was provided by the government for Local Authorities to follow. Specific guidance to produce the Baseline Emissions Inventory (BEI) as part of the evidence base for their CAP was also provided. The guidance proposed both top-down and bottom-up approaches, with spatial analysis incorporated as and where possible. In Cork, we opted for a "Tier 3 Bottom-up Spatially-led" approach.

This involved:

Gathering and processing relevant data on homes, vehicles, and businesses, etc. in each Small Area (SA) in Cork City
Calculating energy demand in each SA for the following sectors: household; commercial and industry; public services; and agriculture &amp; fishing.
Determining fuel shares in the following sectors: household; commercial and industry; public services; and agriculture &amp; fishing.
Gathering data on electricity and gas use for Local Authority buildings and public lighting.
Mapping road transport emissions based on the National Transport Authority Eneval model.
Proportioning non-energy emissions in agriculture and LULUCF emissions based on agricultural areas.
Computing and mapping the GHG emissions in each small area for the following sectors: household; transport; commercial services &amp; industry; public services; agriculture, land use &amp; fishing; and waste handling and treatment.

Cork City's emissions are presented in absolute terms using $\mathrm{ktCO}_{2}$ eq.

Cork City is a member of both the Covenant of Mayors (COM) and ICLEI. The COM Europe Methodology was used for the BEI cited in Cork City's EOI using 2011 data. We have not reported either through the COM mechanism or the Carbon Disclosure Project / ICLEI mechanism. It is our intention to use the CDP / ICLEI reporting mechanism from 2026. Cork City has uploaded the 2023 BEI, based on 2018 data, with its CCC.

The BEI is intended to be regularly updated and to evolve as new techniques and data sets become available. Cork City Council had no capacity or experience to produce the BEI in house. We partnered with the Nyhan Future Sustainability Research Group at University College Cork to adapt the government guidance to best meet the needs of Cork City.

The Cork City Council boundary, shown in Figure 8, is the same as that covered by the BEI, including the territory incorporated into the city by the 2019 boundary extension. The total area covered by the City Council is 187 km². The area comprises 856 Small Areas (SA), which typically contain between 80 and 120 dwellings and are used for the compilation of census statistics. When the City Council boundary was extended some SA were both within and outside the new boundary. Where a SA had less than 10% of its area within the city boundary, it was omitted. 13 SA were consequently removed to give a revised total of 843 SA within the city boundary. Some data for SA that crossed the new boundary were proportioned on a % share of SA size within the boundary. This assumes that data is uniform across the area, which is unlikely to be the case in reality.

The Local Authority Climate Action Plan (LACAP) guidance from government did not require disaggregation of findings into scope 1, 2, or 3 categories. A data collection mechanism for scope 1, 2 or 3 emissions at the city level does not exist yet. This analysis will be done, to the extent that available data allows, in future iterations of the BEI. For this first iteration of the CCC we assume that all emissions are scope 1 and 2. We do not have data to estimate:

Emissions from outside the city boundary (scope 2) due to the use of grid-supplied energy within the city boundary. For buildings our baseline methodology measures estimated actual consumption.
Emissions from outside the city boundary (scope 2) due to the use of grid-supplied electricity used to charge electric vehicles.
Emissions from the 519,033 tonnes waste collected within the city boundary in 2022 (latest available figures) but managed / sent to landfill outside the city boundary (scope 3).
There is very little industrial activity within the Cork City boundary. Emissions in the commercial /industrial sector are dominated by space heating and electricity consumption for services provision. IPPU emissions are, consequently, not included in our baseline emissions inventory.

Conversion factors taken from SEAI's Energy in Ireland Report 2019 were applied to compute emissions from energy demand. The solid fuel factor is based on a 50/50 split between peat and coal.

|  Fuel | Natural Gas | Kerosene | LPG | Electricity | Solid Fuel | Diesel  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  ktCO₂/GWh | 0.205 | 0.257 | 0.229 | 0.375 | 0.348 | 0.264  |

# Assumptions and Limitations of the Sectoral Analysis in Cork City's BEI:

# Residential Buildings:

BER database used to build a housing stock profile of energy demand and fuel share by different end uses,  $51\%$  of houses in Cork City have a BER [7].
The classification of housing types in the Census and BER database are different.
The 11 dwelling types in the BER dataset were combined into 4 housing categories: detached, semi-detached, mid-terrace and apartment as below.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Similarly, the 15 BER ratings, from A1 to G, were combined into 7 BER ratings, e.g. A1 and A2 were combined to just A.
Some SAs had no BERs, and there was a large share with less than  $10\%$  of coverage.
It is well known that the BER is a bad proxy for actual energy demand. The below correction factors (from Figure 27 in [18]) were used to adjust the kWh/m2 values for space and secondary heating.

|  A | B | C | D | E | F | G  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  84% | 79% | 66% | 60% | 57% | 53% | 47%  |

# Commercial and Industrial Buildings:

The Valuation Office provided total floor area by different business types in Cork City, but this was not available at the small area level and omitted hospitality buildings (hotels, B&amp;Bs, bars, restaurants and Cafes).
Floor area by business type was estimated using OpenStreetMap data [12], but there were issues with how some buildings were classified. The 62,864 buildings had to be manually verified to correct those that had been wrongly classified or had no classification. This was a very time intensive process. The vast majority were residential, with 2,611 commercial and industry buildings following several' reviews of the data.

OpenStreetMap data provides building footprint rather than total floor area, i.e. it doesn't include the extra floor area associated with two or three stories. Based on the average number of stories in within SEAI's 'Extensive survey of the commercial buildings stock in the Republic of Ireland' [19], a floor area ratio (ratio of floor area to building footprint) of 1.58 was determined.

|  Stories | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  No. of buildings | 877 | 449 | 125 | 38 | 5 | 7  |

The non-domestic BER release from CSO gives fuel source in main space heating within each county. However, this data is incomplete. In 2018, only 491 (19%) commercial and industry buildings had a BER out of 2,611 identified [11].
There are no Irish energy benchmarks, so UK CIBSE guidelines were used [10].

# Transport:

In using the NTA model, only road transport was considered, which thus omitted aviation, rail and navigation. There is a lack of clear methodology for attributing the GHG emissions of these sectors on such a small scale. For example, many people may travel from outside Cork City to take international flights from Cork airport.
The breakdown of diesel and petrol within the vehicle categories was not available from the Eneval data, only the total emissions on each road.
Travel outside the county was not included. For example, if someone drove from Cork City to Waterford, once they cross the border their driving would no longer be within the study area. In contrast, a Tier 2 approach based on the km travelled by cars registered to Cork City would result in a higher estimate for total emissions.

# Public sector:

Buildings that didn't have metred data available (e.g. hospitals, schools) had the same issues as commercial &amp; industry above.
Floor area for the main hospital buildings was assumed to be 4 stories based on a site assessment of the Cork University Hospital and Mercy Hospital buildings.
Public lighting data was incomplete,  $80\%$  of metred connections had zero values and 9.2 GWh out of 9.45 GWh of the electricity demand is currently unmetered. The unmetered value was evenly spread over the connections with zero values. However, there is likely differences across the city in the level of lighting and thus electricity demand.

# Agriculture, Land Use &amp; Fishing:

Livestock and land use emissions portioned based on farm area, which doesn't capture the type of activity within the study area.
Emissions calculated based on production rather than consumption. This means that the GHG footprint of food consumed (in shops, restaurants or bars) is not included, but rather the very small amount of food produced within the city boundary. The vast majority of food and drinks consumed likely come from outside the study area.

# A-1.2: Emission factors applied (C &amp; C Checklist 13)

|  Total primary energy requirement can be calculated by applying primary energy (PE) conversion factors, which vary by fuel type, to total final consumption values. The table below shows the latest PE factors. Historic factors can be found in the SEAl conversion and emission factors spreadsheet. With the exception of the PE factor for electricity, all of the factors provided by SEAl are default values, which provide an approximation of primary energy requirement for each fuel. The PE factor for electricity is calculated based on the primary energy inputs to electrical power generation during the year.  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Electricity Generation:  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|  Primary energy input per unit of electricity generated, before subtracting own use of electricity in power plants, and transmission & distribution losses. Electricity imports are not included in the calculation of this factor.  |   |   |   |   |   |   |

|  For calculation in t or MWh of primary energy  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|  The Methodology used to compile the figures below is from a national report known as Ireland's Final Greenhouse Gas Emissions. This report is compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency. In previous Inventory reports GWPs from the 4th IPCC assessment report (AR4) were used. Ireland's National emissions reduction objective, carbon budgets and European target under the European Sharing Regulation are all now estimated on an AR5 basis, and this change simplifies the assessment of progress towards these targets. GWPs allow methane, nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases to be expressed in CO2 equivalent terms based (for Inventory reporting) on a 100-year time horizon. The SEAl also provides common Conversions Factors for use in Ireland.  |   |   |   |   |   |   |

Updating of emissions data in Cork City is currently dependent on the availability of national data sets. These are updated by central government institutions on their own timetables. Comprehensive updating of the city level baseline is, therefore, not currently possible on an annualised basis. A mechanism for city-level emissions monitoring will be developed in future iterations of the CCC. In the meantime, components of the baseline will be updated when data becomes available.

The current baseline does not consistently measure and report energy consumption across all sectors and does not distinguish between scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Further, Local Authorities do not have a comprehensive and nationally validated methodology for measuring the mitigation impact of policy measures in different sectors, or for estimating the GHG sequestration capacity of the natural environment within the city boundary. Cork City Council is working with the DECC to develop a nationally applicable baseline methodology for GHG inventories at the local level. These gaps will be addressed in the second iteration of the CCC, due in 2026.

The implications of the baseline inventory on impact pathways for Cork City are quite clear. 85% of emissions come from three sectors – domestic buildings, road transportation, and commercial buildings. The CCC will prioritise actions in these sectors. While public sector emissions within the city amount to only 7% of the total, the leadership role that public bodies have is clear and will be reflected in the CCC, both in terms of actions to rapidly decarbonise public assets and services, and the policy measures, influencing and advocacy that the City Council, and others can take. As discussed, in section 1 above, the support and facilitation of the national government is critical to enable Local Authorities both the flexibility and financial support to innovate and overcome systemic barriers to change. The National Mirror Group will play a significant part in the achievement of our accelerated ambition to achieve Net Zero. The baseline inventory directly informs the strategic priorities of our Climate Neutrality Commitments.

# 1.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

Module A-2 "Current Policies and Strategies" lists and assesses existing policies, strategies, initiatives, or regulation from local, regional, and national level, relevant to the city's climate neutrality transition. This assessment contributes to identifying the gap (if any) between the emissions reduction due to existing initiatives and the city's 2030 climate neutrality target. Filling this gap by identifying additional actions and levers to achieve the city's emission reduction target is the focus of this Action Plan. The assessment of current policies and strategies offers hence a starting point for exploring the impact pathways (See Part C). The module includes:

Comprehensive list of local relevant policies, strategies, concepts, as well as of regional and national legislation that impact local climate action.
Descriptive assessment of the current climate-relevant policy context, summarising the objectives and implementation concepts, addressing e.g., spatial planning, energy, local economy, circular/bioeconomy, waste, transport, housing, urban greening/nature-based solutions).
Quantification of the emissions gap (i.e., emissions reduction target minus reductions already addressed through existing climate action plans).

# A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies (C &amp; C Checklist 14)

A wide range of complementary sectoral plans and policies support climate action in Ireland and are generated at the national and regional levels and at the local authority level. These plans and policies frame the overall approach to climate action, whether for mitigation or adaptation purposes. Effective multi-level governance of climate action is critical in Ireland, where policy making and planning are more centralised than in other member states. By way of comparison, many Local Authorities in other OECD countries have responsibility for a much broader range of services. It ranks Ireland lowest of the twenty-seven EU member states in respect of the level of decentralisation. Overall, the state set a target, in the National Climate Ambition, of a 51% emissions reduction by 2030 in all policy areas. Most of the policies and strategies explicitly highlight the associated emissions domains, and some target quantified emissions reductions at the national or regional level, whereas city level plans and strategies do not, at this time, quantify specific emissions reduction targets. Where this is absent is most often a result of the timing of publication, that is the policy was published before the National Climate Ambition was enacted in 2021. The most important national, regional and local policies, strategies and plans that shape climate action in Cork City include:

Most if not all of the policies, strategies and plans listed in table A-2.1 above are designed to reduce emissions by  $51\%$  over the 1990 national baseline, in compliance with the EU Climate Law 2021. At the national level, 5 year carbon budgets that specify sectoral emissions ceilings have been instituted. Ireland is unlikely to meet the first carbon budget limits and is at risk of meeting the second budget too. The CCAC recommendations to government in its 2023 Annual Review include measures to enable Local Authorities, and others, to contribute more effectively to the necessary solutions, not least by ensuring that barriers to policy implementation are removed by ensuring adequate funding and planning reform is undertaken at scale and speed.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 17: (Source: Indicators / targets | Environmental Protection Agency (epa.ie))

The CCAC Annual Review 2023 states that With Additional Measures (WAM) projections show credible evidence of achievement of a  $33\%$  emissions reduction over a 2018 baseline. However, Figure 17, uses EPA analysis to demonstrate that a significant gap exists to reach the level of ambition set out in the National Climate Action Plan (NCAP) ambition for 2030. This highlights the need for Cork City, and others, to increase local level ambition in order to meet our more ambitious goal. Based on the analysis presented in Figure 17, it is clear that at the national level policies and plans must evolve to allow for steeper emissions reductions in future.

The action portfolio in section B-2 does include actions governed by or instigated by these policies, strategies and plans. They are most concisely drawn together under the Cork City CAP and are expected to deliver at least a  $51\%$  reduction in emissions within the city boundary by 2030. However, there is no duplication of actions included in the Cork City CAP. Section B-2 goes on to set out additional measures to achieve the  $80\%$

reduction we are targeting in this CCC. The remaining 20% of residual emissions in this action plan represent the hardest-to-decarbonise challenges in the city, falling as they do beyond the scope of the City Council. They include, but are not limited to, fossil fuel dependent base-load generation in the national grid which will account for at least 25% of generated electricity by 2030, buildings that are hard technically and economically to decarbonise, especially heritage buildings, and the side effects of rapid population growth. Cork City's population in 2018 was approximately 210,000. This is projected to rise to approximately 280,000 by 2030, and to 350,000 by 2040. In a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario, Cork City's total emissions are estimated to be 1,314,267 tonnes by 2030 with a population of 280,000 people. Our BEI estimated per capita emissions to be 4.7 tonnes CO₂ eq in 2018. Assuming a population of 280,000 by 2030, our per capita emissions in the key sectors measured must be around 0.95 tonnes CO₂ eq, a reduction of 80% per capita over 5 years if we are to ensure that the additional population does not make our targets unachievable. Our BAU scenario includes the polices, strategies and plans set out, but avoids double counting. The gap to target by 2030 is estimated at 515,071 tonnes CO₂ eq, which is 39% of population adjusted emissions. This will be the focus of actions described below. We estimate residual emissions at 20% or 197,140 tonnes CO₂ eq. They are the result of potential resistance to change among citizens, the scale of the financial barrier to retrofitting building, the lack of effective national policy control on emissions from the agriculture sector in Ireland, the relatively low sequestration capacity within the Cork City boundary, and the current absence of district heating and cooling, and carbon capture and storage within the city boundary.

The emissions targets and gaps in table A-2.3 reflect some of the major barriers faced in Cork for measuring vi and prioritising action currently. There is no mechanism in place to systematically account for the emissions mitigation effect of different actions. Consequently, we have assumed, for the first iteration of the CCC, a linear progression in emissions reduction in all sectors. We understand that in reality there will be some variation in progress across different sectors that we can map more effectively when we have an accounting system in place. Across all sectors we have a good sense of measures that will be needed to achieve the  $80\%$  target, but we plan to develop a mechanism to describe their relative impact, cost or delivery mechanism in detail in the next iteration in 2026. These questions will be addressed in future iterations through co-creation with the relevant national and local stakeholders.

Our emissions reduction actions across both the CAP 2024-2029 and the CCC can be seen in the diagram below.

# 1.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

This module aims to document the conclusions of a systems and stakeholder mapping aimed at identifying systemic barriers and opportunities. In conjunction with the GHG inventory and the policy baseline analysis in the previous two modules of Part A, the analysis reported here serves as a basis for designing actions that address these barriers or exploit the underutilised opportunities in Part C. The results of this analysis as provided here include:

A description of the main systems related to the city's GHG emission domains, e.g., technological/infrastructural, institutional/ regulatory, organisational, financial, political, social and behavioural systems.
A description of barriers and opportunities for each of the systems above. This includes gaps (infrastructural/ technological, institutional/ regulatory, organisational, political, financial, behavioural or social) as well as an evaluation of unexploited resources (e.g., renewable energy sources, digital technologies, etc) or circumstances.
A map of stakeholders involved for each of the systems above. This includes relevant actors per systemic element at different levels of governance throughout the whole policy cycle, such as local, regional, national, and EU/supranational administrative bodies and agencies, civil society, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), academia, community-based organisations, social movements, steering groups, private sector actors etc.

# A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities (C &amp; C Checklist 14) (C &amp; C Checklist 17)

Cork City Council faces several critical barriers to achieving its climate neutrality ambition by 2030. All the levers of change identified in the Mission methodology must be applied to overcome them. The main barriers to local authority action at the city level are:

# Government funding and mobilising private resources

Ireland has the most centralised decision-making on funding in Europe. The OECD analysis for 2022, shown in figure 20, highlights that less than  $10\%$  of overall funding is allocated at the local level. Funding decisions for major infrastructure, public incentives for climate-positive policy actions, local authority staffing and other categories of expenditure, limit the capacity of the local authority to support locally-designed policy initiatives. The National Mirror Group, established by DECC in May 2024, is consequently of great importance as a support structure for Mission Cities in Ireland. We are reliant on the centre to support local climate action by addressing pain points where policy coherence at the national level may be inadequate, and to make funding available to accelerate existing climate actions, such as the National Retrofit Plan, and to fund and scale up innovations.

Figure 20: Distribution of General Government Funding in Europe 2022

Public money will be not be enough to provide all of the investment needed to achieve the transition. Cork City is already an attractive destination for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), being ranked first in Europe for FDI strategy,  $2^{\text{nd}}$  among small cities for economic potential, and third in Europe for business friendliness. The city's success is underpinned by its effective collaboration with national institutions including Enterprise Ireland, and the work of its two major universities. As a result, hundreds of international companies of companies have established headquarters or operations in the city and county, with many leading on low-carbon technology, services and manufacturing. Nationally, Ireland aims to become a global centre for sustainable finance. With these promising conditions Cork City Council can develop capacity and appetite, leveraging public finance to mobilise private capital, through its own account and in support of private investment, to help regenerate our building stock, energy generation and distribution systems, public infrastructure and transport systems quickly and cost effectively.

Under the terms of the Local Government Act 2001 Local Authorities may borrow funds only with the explicit sanction of the relevant government minister.

## Related Opportunity

The climate crisis and the reallocation of further responsibilities to combat this to the local government system has allowed new thinking beyond traditional funding mechanisms. The crisis has empowered local government to fund action through new streams of revenue including the new Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund, the Climate Action Fund as well as to have the ambition to access novel funding mechanisms such as the European Investment Bank (EIB).

## Regulatory responsibility for key sectors

In Ireland responsibility for the delivery of legally-binding targets, including the sectoral emissions ceilings, is the responsibility of the central government and its respective departments. The CCAC is a statutory body that advises on the setting of carbon budgets, monitors and reports back on performance at the national level. The EPA regulates emissions from industrial sectors. Local Authorities in Ireland are required by law to produce local climate action plans to set out how national policy will be implemented at the local level but is not endowed with financial or regulatory tools to ensure that delivery happens. Instead, outside the direct control of its own assets, Local Authorities rely on their convening power and ability to advocate for sustainability and influence public attitudes and behaviour, through partnerships and communications.

Further, responsibility for the commissioning, design, build, financing and operation of key infrastructure needed to achieve climate neutrality lies, predominantly, with national institutions. These include transportation infrastructure controlled by the National Transportation Authority, water distribution and treatment by Uisce Éireann, electricity generation and distribution by ESB and Eirgrid, flood risk management infrastructure and some public buildings (such as police stations) by the Office of Public Works. The local authority can advise and, to some extent, influence the plans and works undertaken by these institutions, but it does not have authority over their planning or investment decision-making.

## Related Opportunity

Complex solutions require innovative schemes, not fragmented policies. One of the traits of the system of multi-level governance in the Irish state is the limited level of functions and self-funding avenues delegated to the local government system. Irish local government relies on funding and the power of central government departments to complete innovative projects. The Mission has the advantage of providing Cork City with access to a national Mirror Group of government departments such as DECC and DHPLG which allows for new opportunities in creating partnerships, progressing new funding avenues and solving challenges and blockages in the legislative sphere. Cork should use the soft power that this opportunity for dialogue will allow which is rarely afforded a local government unit. The Council should also make full use of its links to the CCMA to access regional and national political and administrative actors.

## Planning and land use management

Land Use Planning and Management is a democratic local authority function that is critical for the achievement of the 2030 climate neutrality ambition. Through the Cork City Development Plan 2022-2028, Cork City Council has the ability to introduce climate-positive land use measures at the local level. For example, in line with the recent EU Nature Restoration Law, Cork City is currently exploring the introduction of urban greening factors to drive the protection and restoration of biodiversity. However, the national legislative framework to support such climate-positive local planning measures is often lacking, allowing environmentally damaging actions to sometimes be permitted. This includes inadequate environmental or planning legislation around tree felling, drainage and the removal and changes to ground cover and hedgerows in local environmentally sensitive areas. These legislative gaps, alongside capacity and resourcing constraints, also weaken the use of effective enforcement regulations. These asymmetries between local and national policy, implementation and capacity can be exploited at a local level, to the detriment of our climate goal and targets or aspirations for biodiversity recovery.

# Related Opportunity

The improved collaboration between stakeholders, including building owners, developers, architects, engineers, policymakers, and financiers, which could be mediated by the representatives of the Net Zero City Coalition. Cork City Council up to this point has passed a significant number of local plans and strategies promoting positive climate action highlighting the local authority's advocacy powers in this policy area. Development plan policies and objectives are powerful tools to support the achievement of the Missions. Cork City Development Plan strategic objectives were aligned with the UN SDGs, and each were created with climate action in mind. Cork City Council is committed to the development of a sustainable, resilient and liveable compact city based on climate adaptation and transport-oriented placemaking. Other Council policies and strategies in the area of climate, biodiversity, air quality and EV have also been drafted or adopted by Cork City Council.

# Information

Cork City Council does not have an established methodology for measuring the GHG emissions reduction impact of its climate actions outside of energy consumption in its own buildings and vehicle fleet. No mechanism has yet been established to measure the impact of different climate actions taken by stakeholders across the city. The City Council does not utilise green budgeting to measure the GHG emissions related to its capital or recurrent expenditure. Consequently, policy making, planning and decision-making is not adequately informed by data on the mitigation effect of any particular proposal.

# Related Opportunity

The climate crisis has led to a greater awareness of the effects public investment on the environment which has led to changes to the public spending code. We are awaiting a national Green Public Procurement policy to come into effect in the short term. Greater mobilisation to promote and implement positive climate action has led to opportunity to collaborate further with third Level Institutions including the Environmental Research Institute of UCC for instance. This collaboration will allow for the local authority to gain access to key skills particularly in the area of behavioural change which will help to secure citywide buy in to our mission targets.

# Organisational Capacity

Cork City Council's structure, capacity and culture must adapt to the climate transition leadership role it has at the city level. Effectively tackling climate change presents a complex, multi-sector, multi-stakeholder, multi-level challenge to organisations designed to deliver and operate discrete systems for transport and housing among others. Importantly, human resources capacities are not optimally aligned with the hard and soft skill requirements of the climate transitions. The business processes and information technology systems of the City Council can inhibit cross-sector information sharing and collaboration, reinforcing organisational silos. The Cork City Council's forthcoming People and Learning &amp; Development Strategies will make a significant contribution to developing organisational capacity and culture to build a workforce fit for the future, but the organisation must also embed these ambitious changes in structure, systems and processes, to be effective.

# Related Opportunity

The LACAP has afforded the organisation an opportunity to create greater capacity through the embedding of climate awareness through the Personal Management Development System (PMDS) and through the internal climate champion programme.

# Collaborative Ecosystem

The City Council has long-established partnerships and collaborations of different kinds with business, communities, academia and central government, among others. Recognising the scale and complexity of the climate crisis, it is clear that no single stakeholder has the knowledge, capacity, resources or mandate to comprehensively address its impacts. Systems of collaboration must evolve to more effectively harmonise and deploy the diverse capacity of the widest possible stakeholder ecosystem to achieve a shared vision of climate neutrality in the city. The City Council is one stakeholder among many, not just the buyer of services. It must adapt to a role that helps all stakeholders to:

Empowers the different members of the ecosystem through information sharing, enabling equity and opportunities to participate, and creation of a common narrative, and

Enables execution by demonstrating collaboration and flexibility, spurring innovation, activating the market and mobilising green finance.

## Influencing citizen demand and behaviour

The EPA's Climate Change in the Irish Mind study shows that 95% of Irish people think climate change is happening and that 85% of people say that business, local government, politicians, national government, and citizens should be doing more to address climate change. These levels of support for climate action are confirmed through city level research. However, adoption of climate positive behaviour is much lower, with only 37% of respondents indicating they would eat less meat as a climate action or 41% saying they would punish companies who do not do enough on climate change through their consumption choices. The SEAI's National Retrofit Plan provides incentives to achieve the upgrade of 500,000 buildings by 2030. Demand and delivery capacity for retrofitting are growing, but Ireland is still off track on its ambition in this area. The SEAI's efforts to influence demand through financial supports, low-hassle delivery through one-stop-shops and the contagion effect of change, among other positive factors to influence behaviour, are though beginning to make a difference. Cork City Council has no embedded capacity to introduce insights from behavioural science into its policy development in all sectors, its communication, and its service design and delivery. Finding ways to more effectively influence citizen demand and behaviour, whether for retrofitting, personal consumption and waste, or transport choices, is a critical need to accelerate the decarbonisation of our city.

## Related Opportunity

The creation of climate positive communication highlighting co-benefits, and economic benefits of climate investment while also developing strategies that provide for a Just Transition will enable greater buy in from a range of stakeholders.

## Learning by Doing

Cork City Council is committed to grounding our future actions in a manner where designing, testing and redesigning is encouraged to fulfil our vision of a Climate Neutral Cork. Internally the biennial review and iteration of the Climate City Contract and the annual review of our LACAP will allow organic growth of both documents as new policies, partnerships, funding and technologies are realised locally and nationally. The Council will also ensure public engagement in this process through the commissioning of a household survey to examine public sentiment quantitatively and climate conversation sessions to examine sentiment qualitatively. Public engagement through new innovative means such as a Citizens Council will allow for us to see what has worked, what has not worked and what needs to be done differently. The BEI will also be updated regularly to highlight progress on reducing climate emissions and interrogating the various scope emissions detailed in the Mission info kit. Through our internal and external decision-making bodies in the Climate Action Team and Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group we will thoroughly interrogate action and result through after action reviews.

# Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Module B-1 "Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways" lists and describes impact pathways, early and late outcomes and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) according to and adapted from the NetZeroCities Theory of Change and the CCC Action Plan Guidance – clustered by fields of action.

List of impact pathways, selected from or inspired by the NetZeroCities Theory of Change, including early and late outcomes (strategic objectives) and levers of change structured along the fields of action.

The pathways below, in table B-1.1, build on the Cork City CAP 2024-2029, but avoid replication. They focus on the journey from 52% emissions reduction to our goal of an 80% reduction by 2030. The priority is clearly set on the highest emitting building / energy and transport sectors, but includes critical pathways for:

Governance and leadership, necessary to build support for climate action and to encourage more climate positive behaviours.
Communities and partnerships, necessary to improve climate literacy and build a sense of agency and readiness to act.
Natural environment and resource management, necessary to increase the carbon sequestration capacity in the city.

Cork City is at a relatively early stage in its journey towards net zero. The mitigation and adaptation work that is ongoing in the city, whether implemented by the City Council, other public sector bodies, businesses and civil society, has not been coordinated in a single, overarching framework. This is the significant opportunity that being a Mission City offers. There are lots of gaps in our knowledge. The considered, collaborative co-creation of projects and programmes that is fundamental to the Mission concept has not yet been fully mainstreamed city wide, even though there is good evidence of stakeholder engagement and co-design at the project level. Indeed in publicly funded projects this engagement is a statutory requirement. Our next steps include the co-creation of bankable projects in key sectors, facilitated by the thematic sub-groups on buildings and retrofitting, and transportation, that are emerging from the Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group.

The research and engagement processes that were undertaken in 2023 to design the Cork City CAP were the starting point of our structured stakeholder engagements for climate action. The Mission has caused us to establish and design governance structures that have enabled us to secure quite broad commitment to our net zero goal. The co-creation work to specify in detail the projects that will deliver that goal is now starting. Our planned approach, that will shape the second iteration of the CCC is set out in the individual action

outlines BEE/2/AC/A and TM/1/AC/A. Consequently our impact pathways and actions remain largely at a high level in this iteration. Delivery projects will be specified in much greater detail as we move towards the second iteration in 2026 and develop bankable projects, their budgets, timetables and expected impacts, in the meantime. We have many projects ongoing, for example in the retrofitting of social housing, the improvement of the bus network and related infrastructure, the development of low-carbon mass transit, the large-scale development of low-carbon housing on brownfield sites in the city, the mobilisation and financing of community climate action projects, and the scale up of our active travel infrastructure, among many others. At the current stage of implementation, though, it is too early to measure material impact on the city's emissions. The biggest progress made to date has been in the scale up of renewable energy generation and consumption nationally. Ireland's electricity generation emitted 8% less CO₂ in 2023 and provisional data suggests a 17% reduction in the first half of 2024. However, the foundations for decarbonisation in both transport and the built environment, in particular, are well established in policy and will have measurable impact at the city level by 2030. We plan to consolidate commitment to change through the use of Local Green Deals with stakeholder groups working together to deliver specific sectoral outcomes.

We will update the impact pathways shown below in Table B-1.1 for the second iteration of the CCC. Cork City does not yet have a mechanism in place to quantify the direct impact of emissions reduction measures, so direct impacts are assumed in line with table A-2.1 above. These will be refined, with the support of the Government of Ireland, in the coming two years. Similarly, we do not yet have a robust mechanism for quantifying and measuring the co-benefits of the climate actions we propose. This will also be developed for the second iteration of the CCC in 2026. We know, though, that there will be significant social, economic, health, and quality of life benefits associated with the actions herein. We have developed detailed impact estimates and costings at a sectoral rather than project level, using the most up-to-date publicly available information, set out in the Investment Plan. The detailed sectoral analyses are included as annexes to the Investment Plan, and are summarised within it.

The many early changes we expect to see as a result of action in the various impact pathways are set out below. We have summarised these more concisely in the Commitments Document as a summary set of starting points. Recognising, as stated above, that Cork City is at an early stage of its transition then the number of early changes is considered reasonable.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways (C &amp; C Checklist 23)

Cork City utilises all six systemic levers across almost all of our priority areas of action. The levers will contribute to both a direct impact on GHG emissions and create indirect co-benefits, such as improvements to quality of life, economic growth, and air quality. Our iterative approach, learning by doing, will enable us to evolve implementation, investment choice as the prevailing conditions change. We will learn what works best and continuously adapt our approach accordingly.

The summary of levers applied in each emissions domain reflects the absolute importance of the built environment and energy, and transport and mobility domains in Cork City. These priority domains account for  $85\%$  of GHG in our city.

|   | Built environment & energy (including domestic and commercial / industrial buildings+ IPPU) | Transport & mobility | Natural environment & resource management (including waste) | Communities & partnerships | Governance & leadership | Residual Emissions  |

Cork's biggest combined emissions domains are domestic and commercial / industrial buildings, inclusive of IPPU. Together these sectors account for  $56\%$  of total emissions in a BAU scenario for 2030. Transport and mobility accounts for a further  $29\%$ . All these sectoral actions are well supported in policy and planning at the city level, not least in the City Development Plan 2022-2028 and the Cork City CAP 2024-2029. Other local and national policy instruments also provide direction.

# Domestic Energy Retrofit

The policy and strategy drivers for decarbonisation of domestic and commercial / industrial energy use and emissions reduction are well established in the National Retrofit Plan, the National Plan for Non-Domestic Building Retrofit and the Long-Term Renovation Strategy 2020.

Our analysis of the cost and impact of decarbonisation of the domestic building stock and energy systems in Cork is presented in Figure 24 below. Our analysis incorporates assumptions on the growth of the housing stock by 2030 that will be needed to accommodate a population of 280,000. We anticipate the number of new build dwellings required annually (3,859), of different types (detached, semi-detached / end terrace, mid-terrace, apartment), needed up to 2030 and apply an estimate from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland of Tender Price Inflation over the period. In this analysis we use the target, cost-optimal value of B2 BER as the aiming point for the calculation of expected emissions reductions. We anticipate fabric improvements and installation of air-to-water heat pumps constituting the energy upgrades. In total this delivers an anticipated emissions reduction of 337,124 tonnes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq over the implementation period. This is  $95\%$  of our absolute target of 353,707 tonnes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq. We expect that the final gap of 16,583 tonnes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq will be absorbed by new builds exceeding the B2 BER threshold, and the fact that some private dwelling owners undertaking deep energy retrofits will seek to achieve the highest possible BER rating. This analysis includes the 11,500 social housing units owned by the City Council, which are being progressively retrofitted using central government funding and at no cost to tenants. The total cost of domestic retrofit, after grant funding from SEAI is taken into account is estimated at €2,239,125,082. Our plan assumes 13 impact pathways across the six levers of change.

|   | Adjusted Cost of Work | Total Grants for Upgrade to B2 (with adjusted Cost of Work) | Emissions saved Residential Retrofit (tCO2p.a.)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  2024 | €757,122,702 | €292,382,185 | 109,964  |
|  2025 | €674,184,092 | €233,161,602 | 174,249  |
|  2026 | €510,849,032 | €222,626,937 | 219,556  |
|  2027 | €470,481,894 | €217,237,402 | 255,450  |
|  2028 | €458,993,960 | €235,208,253 | 281,686  |
|  2029 | €466,692,945 | €235,299,762 | 299,707  |

Cork City Council owns approximately 11,000 social housing units and is, under the centrally financed Energy Retrofit Programme, progressively retrofitting these units to a B2 BER level. The City Council receives a flat fee of €34,000 per unit and delivers at a pace set by the Department of Housing. Our approach has been to focus on newer, easier to retrofit, buildings first. To date, 900 units have been completed and the current plan envisages a total of 2,750 completions by 2030. To accelerate progress the City Council must advocate for an increase in the central targets and associated funding to 2030. This will also require an uplift in the unit cost to reflect the relative cost of retrofitting older buildings, and the need for additional capacity within the City Council's Housing Maintenance team to coordinate an accelerated programme of action.

SEAI's National Heat Study estimated that up to 54% of heat demand in Ireland could be provided by District Heating powered by renewable heat. However, there are no existing district heat systems operational in Cork City today. Previous experiments on district heating within social housing developments proved uneconomic and unpopular with tenants and were abandoned. Without an existing infrastructure and without proven consumer demand for district heating it is currently unclear whether new investment in district heating will prove cost effective as an emissions reduction measure in the city. Cork City Council has started to engage with the Geological Survey of Ireland to initiate geological surveys in the city to determine the feasibility of geothermal energy as a heat source for future district heating. We will commit to updating our analysis and developing policy in this area if it is deemed relevant.

Retrofitting of residential buildings has already been ongoing in Cork City for several years through the efforts of building owners, with over 11,000 upgrades implemented to date, according to SEAI data. Residential retrofits are supported by the availability of financial incentives from the SEAI, the facilitation of One-Stop-Shop services and informational campaigns to make the decision-making, contracting and implementation processes simpler and more convenient, and the introduction of subsidised loan finance for grant eligible building upgrades through the Home Energy Upgrade Loan Scheme. Workforce development strategies are being implemented under the National Retrofit Plan and are informed by the Report on the Analysis of Skills for Residential Construction and Retrofitting 2023-2030. Our approach in Cork City is to convene a Buildings and Energy Sub-Group to specify and deliver projects to accelerate residential retrofit through initiatives on information and decision-support, financing, local workforce development, implementation innovation such as area-based approaches, communications and social marketing, among others.

## Commercial and Industrial Energy Retrofit

Cork City does not have significant industrial capacity within the administrative boundary. Most emissions related to commercial and industrial result from the operation of buildings and facilities. Retrofitting, installation of RES, and electric space heating systems are the primary means of decarbonisation in this overwhelmingly privately owned sector. The Irish government has not developed an incentive or supports programme for the transition of the industrial and commercial sectors, believing that the market can provide the necessary capital. We assume that this will be the case and will support primarily with information and advocacy. As above, Local Green Deals are expected to work well as a tool to consolidate commitment to delivery of specific sectoral outcomes, including for action in the decarbonisation of commercial and industrial facilities in the city.

# Transport and Mobility

The policy and strategy drivers for decarbonisation of transport and mobility are well-established in the National Sustainable Mobility Policy and the Moving Together Strategy.

The 2023 Climate Action Plan shows NTA research that demonstrates the significant impact of electrification relative to other measures. The achievement of modal shift to active and public transport and the implementation of demand reduction measures in line with the National Sustainable Mobility Policy and the Moving Together Strategy.

Figure 25: Growth in Transport Emissions to 2030

Our estimates of the emissions impact of electrification of a  $60\%$  share of the Cork City private car fleet by 2030, including those estimated to be on the road since 2018, is a reduction of 150.889 tonnes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq in the target year of 2030. Our estimate of costs and the emissions impact of electrification is shown below in figure 26 below.

The Cork Metropolitan Area Walking and Cycling Index 2023 estimates that the current emissions savings related to active travel take up to 69,000 cars off the road and save 18,000 t CO2 eq. The study found that while 52% of residents walk or wheel five or more days a week, 62% drive with the same or greater frequency. There is a huge opportunity to increase the modal shift. 69% of residents support the concept of the 15-minute city with more shops and everyday services close to their homes. 77% support more green space close to their homes. 69% support building more segregated cycle infrastructure, even if it means less road space for other traffic. 82% support low-traffic neighbourhoods. 69% of residents report that 30 kmh speed limits would be useful to walk or wheel more and 58% say that such limits would help people cycle more. All these changes would help people to walk, wheel or cycle more. The index estimates the current value of economic benefits of active travel at over €401 million. These statistics demonstrate strong public support for the measures planned in the Cork City CAP and the CCC.

Demand reduction measures are informed by the National Sustainable Mobility Policy. The Moving Together Strategy and its implementation document, is still in the consultation phase. The direction of travel at the policy level is towards the use of measures, such as strengthening demand management through the planning system and compact growth, embedding the polluter pays principle in the road taxation regime, empowering and supporting Local Authorities to implement demand management, and implementing enabling legislation to support appropriate measure on parking, air quality, among others. This comprehensive and integrated range of potential measures will enable Cork City to accelerate both positive and negative incentives to influence travel behaviour.

The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation Scheme requires suppliers of mineral oil as a transport fuel to incorporate 49% of supply from renewable sources by 2030. It is not yet possible to reliably estimate either the cost or emissions impact of this scheme due to the commercial sensitivity of price information.

There are numerous fora for engagement with the public and interest groups from industry, service users, and civil society on transport-related development issues, such as the Cork City Transport and Mobility Forum, the Irish EV Owners Association, and Pedestrian Cork. These groups will be helpful in engaging citizens in the dialogue around development of a sustainable transport system, and to build legitimacy and support for decisions taken, and ensuring the voices of the hard-to-hear citizens are at the table.

Investment in transport systems is ramping up in part to deliver the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy (CMATS). Cork City Council has an extensive and ongoing programme of sustainable transport infrastructure development, outlined in the Investment Plan, that are primarily funded by the National Transportation Authority. It has recently adopted its EV charging strategy to create a network of on-street and destination charging infrastructure to enable the acceleration of the shift from internal combustion engines. More broadly, work to deliver the objectives of the City Development Plan on the 15-minute city and compact growth are moving forward with the development of detailed local area plans for the expansion zones anticipated to absorb the city's growing population while ensuring that access and connectivity through sustainable travel are prioritised. Private sector organisations are actively seeking opportunities to introduce and scale up shared mobility schemes. Bus Éireann and Irish Rail are investing heavily in electrification and extension of their networks, including the preparatory steps for large investment in commuter and light rail systems in the city. New research and policy development for demand management is entering our development process to

accelerate modal shift. The City Council, working in partnership with Dublin City Council, Ireland's other Mission City, and University College Cork are embarking on a Net Zero Cities Pilot Programme (BUILD CAPA-CITIES) to introduce skills for the application of behavioural science in our programming and service delivery to increase modal shift. Our work to deliver the CCC will increase collaboration and partnership to both accelerate implementation of many of the ongoing initiatives described here and to co-create additional projects that may be needed.

## Natural Environment and Resource Management

The strategy drivers for the natural environment and resource management are well-established in the National Biodiversity Action Plan, the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy, the Cork City Heritage and Biodiversity Action Plan, the Cork City Green and Blue Infrastructure Strategy, the Cork City Trees Strategy, and the Cork City Council Air Quality Strategy.

Cork City impact pathways extend and accelerate actions to increase the area, tree coverage and accessibility of green space, the expansion of the circular economy to reduce waste related emissions, and to more creatively engage farmers within the city boundary in meeting our local food, sequestration and amenity needs. Education, dialogue and co-creation are critical to the further achievement of decarbonisation in this sector. Our existing capital budget envisages nearly €100 million euro of investment up to 2030, with ongoing plans to create a new regional park in the Northwest of the city, to increase tree cover, to support the emergence of a more circular economy, and to upgrade the city centre Bishop Lucey Park, among others. More work is needed to develop further investable opportunities for extending access to high quality green spaces. This will be included in the next iteration of the CCC in 2026.

## Communities and Partnerships

Climate policy in Ireland recognises the importance of community engagement and participation in the design and delivery of programming at all levels. This is in keeping with Ireland's history of public engagement in public policy making through citizen assemblies, which have been used successfully to develop policy on potentially contentious policy such as gender equality (2019) and drug use (2024). The National Dialogue on Climate Action, established in 2020, recognised the need for a whole-of-society collaborative effort that improves climate literacy, funds active engagement in climate action and captures insights from engagement including through social and behavioural research.

Cork City is already using stakeholder consultation in the design of its climate actions. We plan to create further opportunities for citizen participation in decision-making through the trialling and scale-up of effective measures for engagement and co-creation that are currently being investigated under the Cork City CAP. These may include initiatives like citizen juries, or a citizen parliament, but this research has not yet been concluded, The Climate Neutral Cork Public Platform will offer both formal and informal opportunities to learn, contribute and collaborate in climate action of all kinds, including for co-creation of projects at the neighbourhood and city levels. Sustaining financial support for community organisations of all kinds to act is a critical commitment, as is increasing investment in climate literacy. Recent EPA research showed this to be at a very low level of 5%.

# Governance and Leadership

Cork City's participation in the Mission has already influenced the governance arrangements for transition through the establishment of the Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group. This cross-sectoral group draws its membership from both the public and private sector. Its mandate is to commit to the vision of a Climate Neutral Cork, to communicate the benefits of the climate transition through their own networks and to demonstrate their leadership through their own actions. The impact pathways in this priority area envisage significant decarbonisation of publicly owned assets, enhanced engagement with the public and civil society, more effectively coordinated advocacy to the central government, better use of behavioural science, and showcasing the innovation and capacity for transition in the City. The Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group will develop thematic sub-groups, initially on buildings and energy, and transport, to design bankable projects through co-design

# Residual Emissions

Cork City anticipates having to manage a total of 262,853 tonnes $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ eq in 2030. This is a challenging area for many cities. In Cork we plan to develop and implement a robust methodology for the measurement of abatement of residual emissions. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) is a frontier technology for Ireland even while it is being tested and scaled up around the world. The suitability, costs and deployment options for CCUS has been reviewed by SEAI as part of its National Heat Study. Its importance as a decarbonisation option globally is recognised, notwithstanding the uncertainty around the technology, economics and deployment timeframes. In Cork City specifically, there are no major emitters that would be viable for on-site $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ capture. In Ireland lime and cement production facilities are deemed good candidates for CCUS at this stage. Cork City has a substantial rural hinterland within the city boundary which offers the potential for increased sequestration. However, dialogue with landowners, mainly farmers, is not happening and is, at the national level, politically sensitive due to the agricultural sectors importance to the national economy and the sensitivity of food security as a public policy issue. Without major sources of industrial emission with the city there is no current vision for the increased use of the ETS. We must consider the potential for out-of-boundary sequestration and will work with our colleagues in the neighbouring jurisdiction of County Cork to that end. Specific measures to address residual emissions and to develop dialogue with relevant stakeholders will be described in more detail in the next iteration of the CCC in 2026.

# 1.5 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

Module B-2 "Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design" contains a project description for each action planned in the CCC Action Plan. This includes interventions targeted at creating/ enhancing carbon sinks to address residual emissions.

A table of planned interventions grouped per field of action, including interventions by local businesses and industry (B-2.1).
An outline of each action. The table contains all information for implementation (e.g., topic, kind of intervention, emission sector, scope, allocation, responsible actors, GHG reduction by gases and estimated costs), including interventions aimed at addressing residual emissions (incl. carbon sinks) (B-2.2).
A summary of the actions and impact planned to address residual emissions (B-2.3).

The Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group is still in the process of co-creating the actions to be taken. Details of how we plan to do this for buildings and retrofitting are set out in BEE/2/AC/A and for transport, specifically fleet electrification, in TM/1/AC/A below. More broadly, co-creation at the city level for a Just Transition is described in section C, below. At the time of submission the broad action descriptions, stakeholders, indicators have been agreed, but the implementation details, specifically the setting out of leadership (where needed), timelines, milestones, prioritisation and risk levels are still in development and will be presented, in full, in the second iteration of the CCC. We do not expect this to slow down implementation between 2024 and 2026.

Cork City Council has valued the role alignment of policy and plans with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 'Sustainable Development' itself and the strategic importance of the 2030 Agenda and the integrated multiagency approach required to achieve the SDGs has proven helpful in designing, delivering and measuring the outcomes of our policy and plans. The connection of our local level actions with those taken at the global level also supports our sense of solidarity through Cork's contribution to global sustainable development as we aim, through our work "to enhance liveability; create opportunities for economic prosperity; foster environmental responsibility; embrace design excellence and demonstrate visionary leadership and strong governance", in line with the SDG's guiding principles. We assume that all actions of the CCC contribute to the achievement of SDG 13 Climate Action, we have also identified the strongest alignments between our actions and the wider set of SDGs. They are set out in section B.2.2 below for each individual action.

|  Action outline | Buildings and Retrofit Sub-Group  |
|  Action type | Governance  |
|  Action description | Establish a multi-sector public private sub-group to identify and work through policy and practical constraints to acceleration of retrofitting, RES and district heating. Examine the use of innovate infrastructure projects to improve renewable energy generation including hydroelectric generation on the Lower Lee, a pilot project for hydrogen as a sustainable fuel in partnership with Energy Cork and pilot and scale renewable generation on Local Authority assets e.g. solar topped car parks. Detailed plans and bankable projects for this action will be co-created in the thematic sub-group for buildings and retrofitting for inclusion in the next iteration of the CCC in 2026. It is important to note that action will be taken as plans, approaches and bankable projects are defined. We will not wait for the second iteration of the CCC to initiate our work in this area. This is a multi-sector group of both public and private sector institutions from both the city and national level, academia, and civil society organisations. The sub-group will incorporate expertise in construction, financial services, energy efficiency, public education and training, communications, and the Just Transition, among others. Some participants are drawn from the Leadership Group. The group will be convened by Cork City Council. Its operational arrangements, including chair, will be determined by the group members. The objectives of the thematic sub-group are to : ·Identify, plan for and create enabling conditions for acceleration of domestic and commercial retrofitting at the city level, including through public awareness and demand support, skills development and workforce support, coordination of private and public investment, promotion of energy efficiency as a service, supporting ESG disclosures, exploring regional finance approaches overcoming supply chain challenges among others. ·Facilitate and support the development bankable retrofitting and energy efficient projects, and trial innovation projects. ·Identify, facilitate and support increased access to finance from state, EU and private sector sources. ·Identify and execute targeted advocacy on specific systemic changes needed to enable acceleration. ·Solicit input from building owners on plans and projects in development through outreach and engagement through established mechanisms including residents associations and other community networks. We will establish the sub-group in Q4 2024. Given its objectives, this mechanism will also be used to facilitate the development of co-created plans and bankable projects in building retrofit, renewable energy systems and district heating. It will coordinate with, inform and influence the Mission Cities' support work undertaken by the National Mirror Group. Our approach builds on research recommendations from UCC and Cork Chamber into Accelerating Decarbonisation of Cork's Built Environment. A first step will be made through the presentation of Cork City's priorities for support from Central Government at the Second National Mirror Group Meeting to be held in Cork City in October 2024.  |

|  Action outline | Promoting Electrification of the Fleet  |
|  Action type | Demand generation  |
|  Action description | Promote and support the acceleration of fleet electrification for private cars, light and heavy goods vehicles. Detailed plans and bankable projects for this action will be co-created in the thematic sub-group for transport for inclusion in the next iteration of the CCC in 2026. It is important to note that action will be taken as plans, approaches and bankable projects are defined. We will not wait for the second iteration of the CCC to initiate our work in this area. This is a multi-sector group of both public and private sector institutions from both the city and national level, academia, and civil society organisations. The sub-group will incorporate expertise in road and public transport systems, active travel and modal shift, infrastructure, financial services, public education, communications, and the Just Transition, among others. Some participants are drawn from the Leadership Group. The group will be convened by Cork City Council. Its operational arrangements, including chair, will be determined by the group members. The objectives of the thematic sub-group are to: • Identify, plan for and create enabling conditions for demand generation for battery electric transportation at the city level, including through public awareness and demand support, skills development and workforce support, coordination of private and public investment, among others. • Facilitate and support the development bankable transportation projects, and trial innovation projects. • Identify, facilitate and support increased access to finance from state, EU and private sector sources. • Identify and execute targeted advocacy on specific systemic changes needed to enable demand generation. • Solicit input from transport system users on plans and projects in development through outreach and engagement through established mechanisms including transport user associations and other communities of interest. We will establish the sub-group in Q4 2024. Given its objectives, this mechanism will also be used to facilitate the development of co-created plans and bankable projects in building retrofit, renewable energy systems and district heating. It will coordinate with, inform and influence the Mission Cities' support work undertaken by the National Mirror Group. A first step will be made through the presentation of Cork City's priorities for support from Central Government at the Second National Mirror Group Meeting to be held in Cork City in October 2024.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Cork will investigate actions to offset residual emissions over the lifetime of the CCC. Current options include the use of natural carbon sinks and the application of carbon capture and storage technology which is still inherently experimental and will require intensive study before large scale application of the technology can progress.

As outlined in B-2.1 and B-2.2 there are four key actions to be examined:

Investigating and applying carbon capture and storage at scale (RE/1/AC/A): This is a new area of technology. Cork City Council will investigate potential solutions and project ideas and develop them for future iterations of the CCC.
Investigating out-of-boundary sequestration (RE/2/AC/A): Investigate the potential of sequestration of Cork City emissions out-of-boundary. The city is surrounded by County Cork, the largest county in Ireland, which is largely rural.
Promoting participation in the European ETS (RE/6/AC/A): Supporting enterprises to join the ETS if they meet the threshold through knowledge sharing and technical support.
Measuring GHG Sequestration in the City (RE/6/AC/B): Developing a methodology to measure sequestration within the city boundary.

# 1.6 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

Module B-3 "Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning" contains a selection of indicators to monitor and evaluate progress along the selected impacts pathways and fields of action described in Module B-1. as well as a monitoring and evaluation plan, i.e., metadata on each indicator selected, in addition to milestones and timeline. More specifically:

An overview table listing the indicators selected per outcome and impact including targets and evaluation points (B-3.1);
A metadata table for each indicator selected (B-3.2).

Table B-3.1 below shows the quantitative and qualitative indicators selected for the CCC and their linkages with impact pathways and actions. This section sets out the target, timeline, standards and metadata for each indicator.

# Learning Processes and Development of Future Iterations of the CCC

Cork City Council will adopt a reflexive learning process modelled on Kolb's Theory of experiential Learning shown in Figure 27 below. (C &amp; C Checklist 24)

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 27: Kolb's Cycle of Reflective Learning

Kolb's theory describes two ways for people to grasp knowledge. The first is related to the impact of concrete experiences, the second is thinking about those experiences. Reflective observation, watching what is happening, and active experimentation, or trying new ways of working, are ways to help people to transform their experience into knowledge. Cork City Council will mainstream this approach into its management and review processes, whether wholly internal actions, or those conducted in partnership with others. The model accommodates both formal, documented review of actions taken, and informal individual and group learning processes.

Cork City Council has established internal management structures for climate action and the delivery of the Cork City CAP 2024-2029, shown in figure 27 above. These structures will manage and coordinate the work the City Council does on both decarbonisation and adaptation of its own assets and public services, and its influencing, advocacy, and support to other stakeholders in the city as they implement their own actions to achieve net zero. In addition, the structures envisaged to provide city-level governance, the Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group, and the thematic sub-groups, initially addressing buildings and energy, and transport and mobility, will ensure ongoing coordination, collaboration, and resource identification. Engagement with the public and other enterprises and institutions will be supported by the forthcoming Climate Neutral Cork Public Platform. These structures will provide the infrastructure to manage and coordinate

our collective work towards net zero and to ensure that the wider community are engaged and have opportunities to join in.

The CCC, as an evolving, emergent and flexible plan, will develop through several periodic iterations to be published in 2026, 2028 and 2030 for the post-mission implementation period, as shown in figure 28.

Figure 28: Cork City CCC - a phased approach

The City Council will implement the following steps to inform each successive iteration of the CCC:

Updated Baseline Emissions Inventory. The second iteration will draw on the latest available data and address some of the methodological limitations of the 2023 edition, such as related to energy consumption and emissions scopes, while maintaining comparability with the baseline.
Updated Household Survey. The second iteration will be more comprehensive, as survey findings will complement other research work done in the city by our academic partners.
Follow up climate conversations with key stakeholder constituencies in the city and augmented by our ongoing work to stimulate and support public engagement and the creation of a social movement for change.
Review of actions taken during each phase, their impact on emissions, and the identification of lessons from what worked and what did not. This task will draw on the monitoring data from stakeholder groups on the progress of their own actions.
Ongoing work among all stakeholders throughout each phase to co-create and specify new measures, and the means of financing them, to accelerate actions and increase impact.
Statutory Climate Action reporting mechanism is being developed in collaboration

with the DECC and all Local Authorities in Ireland, with the support of Climate Action Regional Offices. The mechanism co-designed in 2024 will be built upon to monitor and report on progress of the CCC, reducing the risk of duplicated effort.

Signatories resign the Commitments Document to show their support for changes that arise from the bi-annual review process.

The Climate Action Unit will collate and share data from all relevant sources and undertake analysis and reporting tasks, with external support from academic and commercial partners where needed. A climate data dashboard will be created for all stakeholders to visualise progress towards net zero, which we expect to be in place by the second iteration of the CCC in 2026.

Monitoring reports will be published annually. Periodic internal and external, independent impact evaluations to review what has changed and how will be commissioned separately.

# Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C "Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030" aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organizational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations – designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified Module A-2 and A-3.

# 1.7 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

This module details the city's governance innovations for achieving city climate neutrality by 2030, describing innovations in institutional design, in leadership, and in collaborative and outreach processes, whether they are inter-organisational or internal to the key organisations responsible for the city's climate neutrality target. It also describes expected outcomes, for example how these governance innovations enable climate actions and their co-benefits (outlined in Modules B-1 and B-2), and how they address the opportunities, gaps and barriers identified in Modules A-2 and A-3. This content aims to include:

Descriptions or/and visualisations of a participatory / collaborative governance model to facilitate the city's climate neutrality target, including institutional design (horizontal links among city institutions, vertical links to other levels of government, roles, responsibilities, ground rules, processes). Building on the systems and stakeholder mapping in module A-3, it highlights the relations and processes established or planned to facilitate joint climate action among stakeholders and systems at relevant levels (e.g., showcasing new organisations, partnerships, alliances, networks, or processes), as well as mechanisms of citizen involvement.

Descriptions of how the governance innovations introduced or planned to reach climate neutrality address some (or all) systemic barriers and opportunities (Module A-3) and contribute to NZC impact pathways (Module B-1), e.g., through improving organisational settings and interorganisational models – horizontally within municipal administration and across local stakeholders in the city ecosystem, as well as vertically at regional and national levels.

Governance and Innovation

(C & C Checklist 8) (C & C Checklist 9) (C & C Checklist 25)

The Cork City Stakeholder Universe is shown in Figures 21 and 22 above. Our expanded participatory governance model is shown below in Figure 29. This locates the structures that comprise the Cork City Implementation, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Model shown in Figure 7, above. This model sets out the co-design and collaborative management and learning structures established at the city level. It shows the connection to the National Mirror Group, an inter-departmental body intended to provide well-coordinated support to the Mission Cities. Climate mitigation policy in Ireland is developed and owned by Central Government. The National Mirror Group is the interface for Cork and Dublin to highlight areas for policy development and coherence. A dotted line to the Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group is included as one of the members also co-chairs the National Mirror Group, whereas the City Council Chief Executive represents the city.

The Climate Neutral Cork Public Platform is shown as the structure that will facilitate opportunities for the wider community to engage with the Mission, through sharing experience and learning, identifying collaborators, and participating, both formally and informally in co-design and co-creation. There are numerous well-established existing networks for governance across a wide range of social, economic and environmental subjects, listed below in tables 1, 2 and 1. Where a deeper-dive is required we are establishing Thematic Sub-Groups to undertake the necessary analysis, policy and planning, and identification of bankable projects.. We will establish both sub-groups on buildings and retrofitting, and transportation, immediately. Its membership will be drawn from relevant members of the leadership group and additional expert organisations to participate as needed. We are progressively mainstreaming climate action in each of them to institutionalise the participation of citizens and relevant stakeholders in all policy areas. Where possible the sub-group role will be strenghten an existing structure. For example, an inter-agency group to govern strategic transport and land use issues, the Cork Area Strategic Plan (CASP) Group, exists, has the right focus and participation, so extending its remit is a sensible approach. This is a more robust and sustainable approach to engagement than creating yet more networks. The City Council is appraising and experimenting with novel forms of citizen engagement that will also be used by the public platform. Taken together, these structures have the responsibility and capacity to co-design, fund and take mitigation policy into action.

# Cork City approach to co-creation of climate actions

Co-creation is fully embedded and will translate our ambition into action for Cork City's transition. To date we have undertaken a design process for the city's statutory CAP development that has engaged citizens, whether as individuals or organised into institutions, businesses, civil society groups or as democratically elected members of the City Council. This process reflects the City Council's policy and plan development process but has gone further than most similar exercises to date, particularly in our engagement of young people and elected representatives in consultation, among other aspects. Cork City's co-creation process is shown below in figure 31.

Figure 31: Established Co-Creation Process

We will build upon this process to embed thisco-creation, monitoring and learning of key climate actions over time. In part, our approach leverages stakeholder expertise, both professional and lived experience, to input through the thematic sub-groups. This is augmented, to ensure a Jst Transition, through the mainstreaming of climate action design in the work of our existing networks of partners working on socio-economic development set out in table C.2.1 below. These networks already address issues of multi-dimensional vulnerability and afford an efficient means to address climate justice for those sections of the community disproportionately or differentially affected by climate change. Their contributions and ways of working are discussed below in section 3.2.2. The public platform, described in more detail below in table C.1.2, is still at the conceptual stage and is being developed by stakeholders. The purpose of the public platform is to bring together sectoral, institutional and public interest groups to share information, learn from each other, identify opportunities for collaboration, enabling and supporting broad participation in co-creation. The public platform offers the opportunity to utilise innovative mechanisms for public engagement, such as citizen assemblies panels and Living Labs as shown in figure 32 below, to drive its function as an action generating vehicle. The Public Platform will utilise experience of initial experiments implemented by both the City Council's Community, Culture and Participation Directorate, and the Cork Food Policy Council's process for developing a sustainable food strategy for the city. Our co-creation mechanism will be developed and initiated by January 2025.

In light of the fact that Comhairle na nÖg is for young people under the age of 18 and who therefore have no other voting mechanism to have their voice heard, Comhairle na nÖg is designed to enable young people to have a voice on the services, policies and issues that affect them in their local area. Comhairle na NÖg has been invited to participate as a member of the Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Team and will join in August 2024. The URBACT Playful Paradigm transfer network is based on the use of “games” for promoting social inclusion, healthy lifestyles and energy awareness, place-making and economic prosperity. Cork as a child-friendly city is one which implements the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child at the local level. As such, the guiding principles of building a child-friendly city mirror the overarching principles of the Convention.

C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

Cork City benefits from a wide range of socially innovative networks, programmes and organisations. The most relevant of them are listed in table C-2.1 above. Some of these initiatives are already contributing to mitigation and adaptation actions. All of them contribute to climate action through a focus on co-benefit areas that contribute to our vision of a sustainable, resilient city and help to enable a Just Transition. Many of these initiatives are long-standing and some are internationally recognised for their excellence, high performance standards, integrity and delivery track record. There is a growing recognition of the role such collaborative networks can play in developing citizen's knowledge about climate change and mobilizing them to act. . The initiatives are supported through a wide variety of national, local and philanthropic funding, much of which is increasingly requiring recipients to set out the climate impact and sensitivity of the funding provided. The inter-twining of many of these initiatives is apparent from their members and partners which shows the depth and diversity of the ecosystem of social innovation in the city. This resource is essential for our transition to net zero. Climate action and the Climate-Neutral Mission is already on the agenda of many of these groups and climate action is mainstreamed in their work plans. The richness, strength and diversity of these groups is a core asset of the city which we will build on to ensure long-term impact of the transition. Many of these established networks, programmes and organisations deal with multi-dimensional vulnerability related to age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, ability, and sexual orientation, among others. Each of them engage concerned communities directly and many have clients directly involved in governance, service design and review. While the Community Response Forum has, as a collaborative network, mounted responses to extraordinary emergency events, it is one of many structures tthat is well positioned to engage with climate-vulnerable groups. Indeed, many of its member organisations are also participants in some of the other networks listed in table C-2.1. Our approach is to frame climate change as an issue of relevance to all these network collaborations by considering the often disproportionate impact it causes among their community of interest, and in terms of the socio-economic issues of concern, whether it be housing, disability and age-related services, gender, citizenship, or employment opportunity, among others.

Cork City's climate action focus is integrated into the recently published Cork City Local Economic and Community Plan 2024-2029 (LECP). The aim of the LECP is to improve the quality of life for all those who live, work, study in, or visit Cork City. The LECP's goals and actions have a special focus on those who have not been able to thrive in the city and those who have a high need of the services and supports available across the city.. Principled, people centred values underpin this plan, and these values will be protected in their approach to health accessibility, inclusion, integration, educational attainment, economic ups and downs and a Just Transition to climate change. The LECP supports our aim is to ensure that climate-vulnerability is considered and addressed through these existing networks, programmes and organisations, constituting a comprehensive approach to vulnerability reduction. For the first time, the Cork City LECP integrates a strategic and policy-aligned climate objective. This underpins Cork City Council and its partners' approach to vulnerable groups and mobilises the resources of the organisation to address this important area of need in all its service areas.

O

Cork City Council has a well-established and multi-sector approach to addressing vulnerability of different kinds across the city and a deep understanding of where the most vulnerable are located at both community and household levels. Our area-based capacity, whether in our housing operations, socio-economic supports, community-based social services, has the capacity to target support to the level of the individual, as needed. There is a long-established programme of services, for example, to the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the city - Revitalising Areas through Planning Investment and Development (RAPID) - using an inter-disciplinary approach to address safety, protect and enhance the environment, promote good physical and mental health, support education, training and employment, develop and support enterprise, support youth networks, and support Traveller-specific interventions, among others. Many of these actions can or do incorporate climate benefits including action on emissions and adaptation. A further example of integrated approaches to vulnerability reduction and climate action can be seen in the Knocknaheeny Housing Regeneration Programme, which is replacing old and sub-standard social housing stock with 650 new units built to high-standards of insulation and energy efficiency, and with improved public realm, local services and green space.

Cork City Council is utilizing its participation in European level projects to enhance capacity for public engagement and co-creation. It is implementing a Net Zero Cities pilot project, Build Capa-Cities. This will build the capacity of Cork City Council staff to accelerate progress across several key sectors to climate-neutrality. The project supports the development of a Local Authority focused micro-credentialled training course on behavioral science and how this can be embedded in the way local authority staff work. This will mainstreamed into real world climate-relevant actions and workplans, such as for modal shift. Cork City Council is also a key strategic partner to University College Cork's participation in the UNIC European University Project. The partnership is supporting development of innovative methods of engagement such as Living Labs. Cork City Council's participation in the EU funded REACHOUT programme has enabled the development of a climate vulnerability tool that provides an easy-to-use interface to visualise zones of relative vulnerability relative to mapped risks. The tool utilises the most recent census data (2022) and risk maps, complementing bio-physical impact assessments to help understand the relative sensitivity of any location to a given hazard, and enables users to anticipate where to target mitigation measures and responses.

# Executive Summary

Under Ireland's Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, each local authority has been mandated to develop Climate Action Plans addressing both mitigation and adaptation measures.

Local Authority Climate Action Plans are expected to further enhance local authorities' ability to lead, engage, coordinate, and become agents of change in response to the ongoing climate change crisis. To inform those efforts, this report describes the modelling and spatial mapping of Cork City's baseline GHG emissions for the base year of 2018. It provides a summary of emissions modelled across the six sectors. These include households; road transport; commercial services &amp; industry; public services; agriculture, land use, land use change, forestry &amp; fishing; and waste handling &amp; treatment. The following table and sections summarise the key findings from this report.

# 1.1 Policy Context

Under Ireland's Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 (hereafter referred to as the 2021 Climate Action Act) each local authority has been mandated to develop Climate Action Plans addressing both mitigation and adaptation measures [1].

Plans are expected to further enhance local authorities' ability to lead, engage, coordinate, and become agents of change in response to the ongoing climate change crisis. They also represent a new opportunity to embed climate mitigation and adaptation in local authority urban planning [2].

To date, local authorities have made considerable progress in accounting for their internal carbon footprint; in energy efficiency improvements in public buildings; and

in developing climate adaptation plans. However, local authorities have made limited progress in climate mitigation beyond their internal carbon footprint.

The new statutory requirement in the 2021 Climate Action Act to provide baseline emissions inventory for the entire administrative area is a significant expansion on the previous role. It requires a detailed understanding of the sources of greenhouse gases in all sectors.

## 1.2 Objectives of this report

The primary objective of this research was to model and spatially map Cork City's baseline GHG emissions for the base year of 2018. A ‘Tier 3 Bottom-up Spatiality-led’ approach was applied as set out in the Guidelines for Local Authority Climate Action Plans, Technical Annex C - Climate Mitigation Assessment: Baseline Emissions Inventory [3]. This involved:

Gathering and processing relevant data on homes, vehicles, and businesses, etc. in each Small Area (SA) in Cork City
Determining energy demand in each SA for the following sectors: household; commercial and industry; public services; and agriculture &amp; fishing.
Determining fuel shares in the following sectors: household; commercial and industry; public services; and agriculture, land use &amp; fishing
Gathering data on electricity and gas use for local authority buildings and public lighting.

Mapping road transport emissions based on the National Transport Authority Eneval model.
Proportioning non-energy emissions in agriculture, land use, land use change and fishing emissions based on agricultural areas.
Computing and mapping the GHG emissions in each small area for the following sectors: household; transport; commercial services &amp; industry; public services; agriculture, land use &amp; fishing; and waste handling and treatment.
Extracting energy and emissions modelled for the Decarbonisation Zone (DZ) and mapping these..

## 1.3 Study area

The study domain included the Cork City Council administrative area. This included the expanded Cork City boundary (this expansion occurred in 2019).

## 1.3.1 Cork City

The expanded Cork City has an area of 187 km² and had a population of approximately 210,000 in the year 2018. Within the new Cork City boundary, there are 856 Small Areas (SAs). SAs are regions which generally contain between 80 and 120 dwellings and are used for the compilation of

Census statistics [4]. With the expansion of the boundary, some SAs fell both within and outside of Cork City. Therefore, it was decided to omit areas where less than 10% of their total area was within the boundary. This removed 13 SAs to give a revised total of 843 SAs.

- Background

## 1.3.2 Decarbonisation Zone

An area within Cork City, which comprises 52 SAs, was identified as Cork City's Decarbonisation Zone (DZ). The DZ covers a land area of 5km² (approximately 3% of Cork City's total area) and had a population of 13,927 (~11%). It is primarily a residential area with plenty of apartment developments surrounding University College Cork and

Munster Technology University. It also includes Cork City's two large hospitals, namely the Bon Secours Hospital and Cork University Hospital (CUH). Industrial activity within this area is concentrated in the Cork Business and Technology Park on Model Farm Road.

- Analyses &amp; Results by Sector

# Analyses &amp; Results by Sector

The approach to spatial mapping of energy and emissions was primarily based on Codema's guidelines [5]. The sectors identified generally followed the categories in EPA's national reporting [6].

One key difference is the attribution of electricity emissions to the source of demand rather than the power plant. In the national inventory, electricity emissions are within 'energy industries', but here they are attributed to the point of demand (electric appliances or lighting). This classification is more useful for identifying mitigation measures such as those within the Local Authority Climate Action Plan.

|  Sector | Description  |
| --- | --- |
|  Household | Emissions from both direct fuel burning for space and water heating or cooking as well as those associated with electricity demand  |
|  Road Transport | Road transport emissions within Cork City's boundary based on the National Transport Authority Eneval model  |
|  Commercial Services & Industry | Emissions from heating and electricity demand in commercial buildings (e.g. shops, offices, hotels, bars) and industry or manufacturing  |
|  Public Services | Emissions from Local Authority owned buildings and street lighting along with other public buildings such as hospitals and schools  |
|  Agriculture, Land Use & Fishing | Emissions from livestock, land use, land use change, forestry and machinery  |
|  Waste Handling & Treatment | Emissions from waste and the treatment of wastewater  |

# BER Entries

With this new dataset (N = 40,121), the BER entries for Cork City were analysed. The entries were separated into subcategories by BER (A to G) and household type (Table 3).

The BER database also included information .about each entry's area for the floor, doors, walls and windows. Each dwelling type group's average m² values for all ratings were computed. This was used to account for the size differences between the various types of dwellings, i.e., so that relative energy consumption and emissions were considered instead of only the emissions from larger homes.

|  Dwelling Type | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | Total | Actual Cork City  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  All households | 3% | 16% | 39% | 21% | 11% | 5% | 6% | 40,121 | 78,856  |
|  Detached | 6% | 19% | 41% | 19% | 8% | 3% | 4% | 5,780 | 11,360  |
|  Semi-detached | 3% | 11% | 43% | 22% | 11% | 5% | 5% | 16,346 | 32,127  |
|  Mid-terrace | 2% | 15% | 36% | 21% | 13% | 6% | 7% | 10,467 | 20,572  |
|  Apartment | 1% | 28% | 30% | 20% | 10% | 4% | 8% | 7,528 | 14,796  |

Table 3. All BER household entries categorized by dwelling type and BER rating.

The values for delivered energy of lights, pumps, fans, space heating, water heating etc. were averaged. The average total delivered energy for each BER sub-category was then calculated.

This was then multiplied by the corresponding number of entries in each sub-category to calculate the total energy consumption for the housing type group. The average annual energy demand for each home was then determined. The same methodology was applied to all housing types, resulting in a total annual energy demand (expressed in GWh) for the household sector of Cork City in 2018, including a breakdown by fuel which could be used to determine emissions based on conversion factors from SEAI's Energy in Ireland Report 2019 [9].

# Heating System Types

Figure 4. Share of fuels  $(\%)$  used for main space heating in Cork City homes derived from BER data  $(N = 40,121)$ .

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Using BER data, a model was created in Python (version 3.8.16) to determine the profile of housing types for each SA. These profiles were applied to the housing stock to determine the percentage of each housing type in each local area. For Small Areas with no BER data, the overall profile of housing types for Cork City (Figure 4) was employed. The average annual energy demand and emissions computed previously for each housing type was then applied to the number of homes of each housing type in every SA. Using QGIS (version 3.28.1), energy and emissions were then

spatially mapped for Cork City. As the square area of SAs varied widely across the city, expected spatial patterns became skewed when absolute energy or emissions for each SA code were applied to its geographical area. To standardise emissions across SAs, emissions densities in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  per  $\mathrm{km}^{2}$  were computed and mapped as well as  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  per home and per capita. For the purpose of decarbonising the household sector, heat energy density was also mapped to aid in identifying SAs eligible for district heating. Please see accompanying documentation for all mapped results.

# Key findings

Total  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions from the household sector were  $332\mathrm{ktCO}_{2}$  in 2018.
Total energy demand from the household sector was 1174 GWh in 2018.
The housing stock for Cork City in 2018 included 78,856 homes.
Semi-detached homes made up the highest share (41%) of the housing stock. This was followed by terraced homes (26%), apartments (19%), and detached homes (14%).

The average BER was a C1, with  $58\%$  of the housing stock having a BER of C3 or higher.
The highest emitting housing type was detached, contributing  $5\mathrm{tCO}_{2}$  per home, while the lowest emitting housing type is apartment, contributing  $3\mathrm{tCO}_{2}$  per home
Home heating demand accounted for  $71.7\%$  of energy and contributed  $62.6\%$  to total emissions.
Electrical usage accounted for  $29\%$  of energy and contributed  $38\%$  to total emissions.

The larger detached homes in exurban SAs outside the city exhibited the highest total energy and emissions estimates. However, when emissions per  $\mathrm{km}^2$  were examined, due the higher density development in the city, the urban SAs exhibited the highest values.
Higher emissions from larger suburban homes and lower emissions from smaller apartments and terraced homes in the city centre was also observed in the maps generated.
No clear spatial pattern was determined when  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions per person (capita) was mapped.

# Tonnes of CO₂ Emissions per km of road

Utilising the NTA's Eneval emissions model, the road links within Cork City were extracted and the associated GHG emissions along these road segments were determined. The total GHG emissions were subsequently computed at the SA level. In cases where road links were located across two or more SAs, a percentage of the total GHG emissions was attributed to each SA based on the percentage of road which fell within each SA.

# Weekday traffic

Additionally, the modal split along the modelled road links in Cork City was determined for the annual average weekday traffic (See Figure 7).

% of total journeys were made by car while less than 1% were made by bus. The breakdown does not include zero-carbon commuting modes (walking or cycling).

# Car ownership

While the Eneval model estimates emissions along the city's road network, it is also important to look at car ownership in Cork City. In Figure 8, the number of cars per person in each SA are mapped. The city centre had very low ownership of 0.03 - 0.25 cars per person while areas surrounding the city had a much higher car ownership of 0.60 - 0.79 cars per person. Please see accompanying documentation for all mapped results.

# Key findings

Total emissions from road transport were 290 ktCO₂-eq.
Cork City's modal split was as follows: cars (87%); LGVs (9%); HGVs (4%), and busses (1%).

Cork City residents owned around 90,000 cars in 2018.
The major road links (Lower Glanmire Road, N8 and South Ring Road, N40) are clearly visible on Figure 1 and Maps 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4.

Car ownership is significantly higher in the exurban SAs, with some having as high as 800 cars/1,000 people. This compared to a city-wide average of 410 cars/1,000 people and a national average of 450 cars/1,000 people

# Non-domestic main heating

Despite the gas network in Cork City, according to the non domestic BER database, electricity is the largest source of space heating in non-domestic buildings. This reflects the national average and may in part be explained by the

type of business activity in the city. Nationally, electricity is the dominated source of space heating in retail and office buildings (Table 5). Please see accompanying documentation for all mapped results.

|   | Mains Gas | Heating Oil | Electricity | LPG | Other  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Retail | 17% | 4% | 78% | 1% | 1%  |
|  Office | 31% | 7% | 60% | 1% | 1%  |

- Commercial Services &amp; Industry

# Key findings

Total emissions from the commercial services and industry sector were 216 ktCO₂.
Total energy demand was 650 GWh. This included Heating (Gas 154 GWh, Oil 14 GWh and Electric 298 GWh) and Electricity (184 GWh).
There is very little industrial activity (only 2% of the sector total).

Activity in this sector was mainly concentrated in the city centre where there was a lot of retail and hospitality businesses.
The average BER for non-domestic buildings in Cork City was a D1 in 2018, which is the same as the national average [11].

Two key issues in this sector are the lack of data on floor area by different building uses (m²), and reliance on UK energy benchmarks for performance (kWh/m²). Further reflections on this are outlined in Appendix B.

## Appendix B - Assumptions and Limitations

### Key Data

National emissions in 2018 were taken from the EPA's National Inventory Report [6]
Energy demand and supply in each sector is primarily based on the SEAI's National Energy Balance [13].
The following conversion factors from SEAI's Energy in Ireland Report 2019 were applied to compute emissions from energy demand [9]. The solid fuel factor is based on a 50/50 split between peat and coal.

|  Fuel | ktCO_{2}/GWh  |
| --- | --- |
|  Natural Gas | 0.205  |
|  Kerosene | 0.257  |
|  LPG | 0.229  |
|  Electricity | 0.375  |
|  Solid Fuel | 0.348  |
|  Diesel | 0.264  |

### Mapping

The extended city boundary didn't perfectly align with the SAs, which meant some data on the outskirts had to be proportioned based on % share of SA size within the boundary. This assumes the data is uniform across the area, which is unlikely to be the case.
SAs with less than 10% of their area inside the boundary were excluded, removing 13.
Appendix B - Assumptions &amp; Limitations

# Household

BER database used to build a housing stock profile of energy demand and fuel share by different end uses, 51% of houses in Cork City have a BER [7].
The classification of housing types in the Census and BER database are different.
The 11 dwelling types in the BER dataset were combined into 4 housing categories: detached, semi-detached, mid-terrace and apartment as below.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Similarly, the 15 BER ratings, from A1 to G, were combined into 7 BER ratings, e.g. A1 and A2 were combined to just A.
Some SAs had no BERs, and there was a large share with less than 10% of coverage.
It is well known that the BER is a bad proxy for actual energy demand. The below correction factors (from Figure 27 in [18]) were used to adjust the kWh/m² values for space and secondary heating.

|  A | B | C | D | E | F | G  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  84% | 79% | 66% | 60% | 57% | 53% | 47%  |
Appendix B - Assumptions &amp; Limitations

# Transport

In using the NTA model, only road transport was considered, which thus omitted aviation, rail and navigation. There is a lack of clear methodology for attributing the GHG emissions of these sectors on such a small scale. For example, many people may travel from outside Cork City to take international flights from Cork airport.
The breakdown of diesel and petrol within the vehicle categories was not available from the Eneval data, only the total emissions on each road.
Travel outside the county was not included. For example, if someone drove from Cork City to Waterford, once they cross the border their driving would no longer be within the study area. In contrast, a Tier 2 approach based on the km travelled by cars registered to Cork City would capture all travel even when the cars leave the city boundary, and thus would result in a higher estimate for total emissions.

# Commercial Services &amp; Industry

The Valuation Office provided total floor area by different business types in Cork City, but this was not available at the small area level and omitted hospitality buildings (hotels, B&amp;Bs, bars, restaurants and Cafes).
Floor area by business type was estimated using OpenStreetMap data [12], but there were issues with how some buildings were classified. The 62,864 buildings had to be manually verified to correct those that had been wrongly classified or had no classification. This was a very time intensive process. The vast majority were residential, with 2,611 commercial and industry buildings following several reviews of the data.
OpenStreetMap data provides building footprint rather than total floor area, i.e. it doesn't include the extra floor area associated with two or three stories. Based on the average number of stories within the SEAI's 'Extensive survey of the commercial buildings stock in the Republic of Ireland' [19], a floor area ratio (ratio of floor area to building footprint) of 1.58 was determined.

|  Stories | Number of buildings  |
| --- | --- |
|  1 | 877  |
|  2 | 449  |
|  3 | 125  |
|  4 | 38  |
|  5 | 5  |
|  6 | 7  |
Appendix B - Assumptions &amp; Limitations

The non-domestic BER release from CSO gives fuel source in main space heating within each county. However, this data is incomplete. In 2018, only 491 (19%) commercial and industry buildings had a BER out of 2,611 identified [11].
There are no Irish energy benchmarks, so UK CIBSE guidelines were used [10].

## Public Sector

Buildings that didn't have metred data available (e.g. hospitals, schools) had the same issues as commercial &amp; industry above.
Floor area for the main hospital buildings was assumed to be 4 stories based on a site assessment of the Cork University Hospital and Mercy Hospital buildings.
Public lighting data was incomplete, 80% of metered connections had zero values and 9.2 GWh out of 9.45 GWh of the electricity demand is currently unmetered. The unmetered value was evenly spread over the connections with zero values. However, there is likely differences across the city in the level of lighting and thus electricity demand.

## Agriculture, Land Use &amp; Fishing

Livestock and land use emissions portioned based on farm area, which doesn't capture the type of activity within the study area.
Emissions calculated based on production rather than consumption. This means that the GHG footprint of food consumed (in shops, restaurants or bars) is not included, but rather the very small amount of food produced within the city boundary. The vast majority of food and drinks consumed likely come from outside the study area.

# 1. Introduction

## Why are we joining the Mission for a Climate Neutral Cork?

Climate action is at the heart of an ambitious vision for the future of Cork. The National Development Plan envisages Cork as the fastest growing city in Ireland up to 2040. The city is benefitting from rapidly growing Foreign Direct Investment and significant public sector investment. At the same time, Cork is particularly vulnerable to the extreme impacts of climate change. Flooding has been a recurrent theme in our city's history. While our resilience is growing, we have firsthand experience of climate induced hazards, and the multi-dimensional costs incurred.

Our city's commitment to climate neutrality by 2030 is critical goal. Achievement of our climate neutrality goal will ensure that Cork remains a thriving, fair and sustainable place long into the future.

## Expression of Interest

When we initially applied to join the other 100 cities participating in the mission, we thought it would help us to make the city an attractive, high-quality, resilient place in which to live, work, visit and do business. We recognised that the prioritisation of climate action would improve quality of life for residents of the city and ensure that Cork plays its local role in addressing the most pressing global challenge of our time. Our ambition to achieve net zero by 2030 is intact and our plan, set out in the Climate City Contract, sets out how it can be achieved.

## Mandate for change at the City Level

Cork's involvement in the Mission is a strong signal of the city's ongoing commitment to sustainability and climate neutrality. 86% of respondents to a city-level household survey undertaken in 2023 supported the statement that « Cork City must transform into a more sustainable place to live and work that is climate neutral and resilient ».

## Mandate for Change at the National Level

In his letter of support for Cork's application to join the Mission, the then Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, stated that Cork will be « at the forefront of demonstrating how local authorities, relevant public bodies, businesses, third level institutions, civil society and citizens can work together in practical ways to tackle emissions ». He went on to call for the establishment of a cross-departmental team at the Central Government level to coordinate the required national level support. This team, the National Mirror Group, met for the first time in May 2024. It has established a thematic sub-group on transportation tasked with the identification of priority projects for accelerated investment. It plans to establish a similar group on the built environment in 2024. The next meeting of the National Mirror Group will be in Cork in October 2024. Ireland's mission cities will present

their highest priority support needs to the group at that point, setting out what useful and practical support from the central government to the cities should look like.

The heightened ambition, to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, is a powerful lever for change that has helped us to form a compelling vision of a future Cork that residents are demanding. Consequently, we are reconsidering our approach to climate change in a holistic and radical way. We expect that it will catalyse innovation, new ways of working, new partnerships, and new social and economic opportunities.

## Building on past experience

While some may think this challenge is too big, too difficult, responses to recent challenges, such as Covid-19 and the Global Financial Crash, have been cohesive, ambitious and in some cases led to permanent changes in our infrastructure, services, and partnerships. These responses have acted as catalysts for further positive change. Cork's people remain hungry for the systematic change required to achieve the climate transition and are willing to take part in it.

## Actions taken to date

In Cork, our approach to the development of the Climate City Contract is evidence-based and utilises co-creation with the many stakeholders in the city. In 2023, the City Council implemented the following initiatives to develop our approach to climate action:

## Understanding the system

In 2023 Cork City Council commissioned a series of research products to inform our climate journey. They were:

An updated **Baseline Emissions Inventory** using 2018 data that comprehensively estimated our sectoral emissions.
A **Climate Risk Assessment** that modelled the changing hazard profile of the city up to 2050 using the latest climate change projections available. The assessment showed our growing exposure to flood and temperature related risk.
A citywide **household survey** to understand the general public's attitudes and behaviours regarding climate change and their support for change.

## Engaging our stakeholders

Cork City's baseline research was complemented by extensive engagement with people living and working in the city. The public engagement involved the following actions that involved well over 1000 individuals:

A series of **Climate Conversations** with:
business,
community organisations,
the public sector

The overarching messages from these conversations, captured with the evidence from our research in a summary report were:

There is a strong appetite for change to cope with the climate and biodiversity crises. Citizen engagement is key. Everyone will be included in the journey.
Radical collaboration is needed. Business as usual will not be enough. This applies equally to stakeholders at the city level and with other levels of governance. Radical collaboration is at the heart of our co-creation.

In 2024 the Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group, a multi-stakeholder body, was formed to lead the transition process in Cork City over the next five years. Later this year the Climate Neutral Cork Public Platform will be launched to provide a space for virtual and in-person interaction between stakeholders to facilitate learning and collaboration as part of a social movement for change.

# Cork's Current Commitment: Our First Step to Climate Neutrality

The outcome of our work in 2023 was the Cork City Climate Action Plan 2024-2029 (CAP) and annex of actions which was adopted by the City Council in February 2024. It describes the city-level actions to achieve the National Climate Ambition, set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act, 2021, of a  $51\%$  reduction of GHG emissions by 2030. Our approach is to integrate actions that help the city to mitigate emissions and adapt to climate change, as shown below in Figure 1.

The Cork City CAP is incorporated into our Cork City 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CCC) providing measures to achieve 51% of emissions reduction in the city by 2030. The CCC builds on this foundation to achieve an 80% emissions reduction over 2018 levels by 2030. Our CAP establishes enabling conditions for action in key sectors and redoubles our commitment to accelerate implementation in those sectors. The CCC extends the impact of the CAP by identifying gaps and addressing some of the more challenging policy areas needed to achieve net zero. The relationship between the CAP and the CCC is shown below in Figure 2.

## EU Support and engagement

Cork City and its various institutions in local government, business, academia, and civil society, are very actively engaged on EU funded climate action initiatives. Participation in the Mission is providing us opportunities, and we expect them to grow over time. Cork City Council, working with Dublin City Council and University College Cork, were recently awarded a Net Zero Cities Pilot Project to build capacity to apply behavioural science in our climate action. We are a partner on Green in Cities, funded from the joint cities / adaptation mission call. We are also a member of the Intelligent Cities Challenge and are using Local Green Deals to consolidate commitments made as part of the Climate City Contract into specific actions to implement. The City Council is preparing a submission to the EIB for an ELENA grant to facilitate the decarbonisation of its buildings, an opportunity we learned about through the Mission.

More broadly, institutions in the City are participating in myriad projects and international collaborations of relevance to our transition funded by, among others, Horizon Europe, Interreg, LIFE, and UNIC. Cork City is also participating in the EU Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and to Restore our Oceans and Waters, and is actively learning from

# Progress on Climate Change in Cork City

Locally, Cork City has made progress on the implementation of:

Bus Connects, an important project to increase bus services by  $53\%$ , electrify the bus fleet and improve frequency and reliability.
Design and route finding for a 17 km light rail system crossing the whole city.
Construction of  $72\mathrm{km}$  of safe cycling infrastructure city-wide to enable modal shift.
Development of a flagship housing regeneration project in Cork's Docklands, providing new, A-rated homes for over 20,000 people on a 147-hectare site, that builds in green space, active travel, nature-based drainage solutions and other climate-friendly features.
An additional 20,000 A-rated new homes in expansion areas built to achieve the city's goal of compact growth, as described in the Cork City Development Plan 2022-2028.

# 2. Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

## Cork's Net Zero Goal

Cork City Council's vision: Cork City is transforming into a climate neutral and resilient city. We are rapidly becoming a fairer, healthier, more economically vibrant, and more sustainable place to live, work and do business.

## Cork City has established three inter-linked goals for 2030:

Achieve net zero GHG emissions in line with the EU's Climate -Neutral and Smart Cities Mission's objective, which we consider a minimum of an 80% emissions reduction over 2018 baseline levels¹.
Protect and enhance our natural and built environment for future generations, and
Establish best-practice governance to lead the city into a sustainable and prosperous future.

Our elected representatives are committed to the achievement of this vision. The City's first Climate Action Plan was unanimously adopted on February 12th, 2024. The city is home to a diverse array of stakeholders in business, the public sector, academia, and community organisations all forging towards a more sustainable and climate neutral future, and with strong support from the public, who are demanding that action is taken. All stakeholders are working together to achieve climate neutrality.

The vision articulated is critical. We know there are gaps, some significant, in our knowledge, capacity, finance, and infrastructure. We know that significant effort will be needed to mobilise support from the Government of Ireland and the EU. Most importantly, we know that we must build and sustain a social movement for change among the citizens of the city, ensuring that each of us can make the critical changes needed in how we consume, move about, work and operate our homes and businesses. Our transition is one based on co-creation of solutions, networked governance, collaboratively financed and implemented, and that is focused on learning by doing, and impact.

Successive iterations of our CCC will set out specific solutions to achieve the additional decarbonisation needed to achieve net zero.

Our success is dependent on our ability to accelerate the implementation of the many policies, strategies and plans that are already in place in the most climate relevant sectors, and to develop new initiatives to build on them further. Success is not only dependent on what the City Council does. It is a true "whole of society" effort that will engage and activate our private sector, our communities, our public sector bodies, and our academic institutions.

¹The EU Mission considers 80% direct emissions reduction to be "net zero" with, on average, 20% of residual emissions in hard-to-decarbonise sectors being addressed through deployment of future technical solutions such as Carbon Capture and Storage, sequestration, or emissions trading.
Co-Benefits of Climate Action

Climate Neutrality Commitments

O

# Co-Benefits of Climate Action

People who live and work in the city will be the ultimate beneficiaries. Our research shows that citizens of Cork appreciate the links between climate action and their co-benefits. Benefits of transition will accrue in a range of areas that include:

## Health:

Improved air quality,
Improved wellbeing of citizens,
Increased area of green spaces within the city, and
Increase in the modal share of active and public transport.

## Economy:

Citizen involvement in the co-design / co-creation of climate actions,
Increased funding for social innovation initiatives for climate neutrality,
Increase in the number of green jobs,
Increased public capital invested in climate action projects, and
Increased development of brownfield areas.

## Resilience:

Reduction of the Urban Heat Island Effect,
Reduced energy consumption per household,
Increased citizen's awareness regarding sustainability and the environment,
Increased recycling rate of municipal waste, and
Increased percentage of tree canopy within the city.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

## Area

Figure 4: Cork Net Zero Cities Boundary

The area for action under the CCC is the Cork City Council Administrative Boundary, shown in Figure 4 above. It comprises $187~\mathrm{km}^2$. There are no geographical exclusions from the area.

# Sectors

The CCC will guide action in the following relevant sectors:

Domestic buildings
Commercial / industrial buildings and processes
Transport and mobility
Public sector
Agriculture, land use, land use change and forestry
Waste

# Gases

The CCC includes the following greenhouse gases in its estimate of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalents:

Carbon Dioxide  $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$
Methane  $(\mathrm{CH}_4)$
Nitrous Oxide  $(\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O})$
F-Gases (hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons)
Sulphur Hexafluoride  $(\mathrm{SF}_6)$
Nitrogen Trifluoride  $(\mathrm{NF}_3)$

# Scopes

The CCC will ultimately specify scope 1 and 2 emissions (with scope 3 for out of boundary waste emissions only) in its decarbonisation plan. However, since the updated BEI (Baseline Emissions Inventory) methodology, informed by Government of Ireland
Coeberate Catheath Disaster Council Care City Council

Climate Neutrality Commitments

C

recommendations, did not specify the elaboration of scopes, this data will be specified in the second iteration of the CCC, planned for publication in 2026.

# Exclusions

There are two specific exclusions from this plan. Flights from Cork City Airport and navigation of ships entering and leaving the Port of Cork, both of which currently sit within the city boundary, are excluded from the calculations in Cork City's Baseline Emissions Inventory. There is no currently available methodology for calculating these emissions on a small area basis. It is noted that Cork International Airport is implementing a sustainability strategy to achieve net zero emissions in the operation of its terminal and campus well in advance of 2050. Flight emissions are included in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and are governed, in Ireland, by the Environmental Protection Authority. The Port of Cork is in the process of implementing its masterplan for 2050. This plan will see the movement of its operations out of the Cork City boundary to the Lower Harbour area. The City Quays Facility will have moved by 2028, and the Tivoli Docks will move between 2030 and 2040. These are both issues we intend to address in future iterations of the CCC.

# Emissions Trading System

There are currently no European Emissions Trading Systems facilities within the boundary of Cork City.

# Risks of Inaction

Even if it was a legal possibility, the risks of inaction are potentially severe. Firstly, the cost of transition goes up every day, and the range of choices on what should be done, and the time to accomplish those actions reduces. Cork's reliance on fossil fuel as a main source of energy will continue to rise and may become decoupled from renewable energy prices in future. Failure to act may make the city less attractive to tourists and inward investment, who are likely to increasingly seek more sustainable destinations. Social pressures and inequality may grow as citizens are faced with growing vulnerability to extreme weather events and ongoing deterioration of air quality.

# 3. Strategic priorities

## Strategic priorities for the CCC

### Prioritisation

Since we have just five years to accomplish our transition all of the priorities stated above will be addressed simultaneously. We understand that their achievement will require the accomplishment of preparatory tasks in all sectors that are now being initiated. This includes spatial plan reviews, stakeholder engagement, identification of sources of finance, and deployment of appropriate capacity, among others.

The Cork City Climate Action Plan has adopted five themes as strategic priorities to organise its actions.

The five priority themes, their specific objectives and a summary of the most important early changes are:

### Governance &amp; Leadership

Our community will work together through an inclusive and accountable governance structure to achieve a fair climate transition that leaves no one behind.
A governance structure that engages people living and working in the city and supports them in gaining knowledge and acting, individually and collectively, in ways that protect and enhance our climate and environment.

The early changes targeted under this strategic priority may be summarised as:

Public sector leadership through full decarbonisation of local authority and other public sector buildings
Increase coordinated regional advocacy to central government on subsidiarity, funding and policy coherence, and Bundling bankable projects from multiple stakeholders in Local Green Deals.

### Communities &amp; Partnership

Climate action will be mainstreamed in all areas of community development, including for youth, gender, poverty and social inclusion, integration, health, arts, and travel, among others.
The diverse community groups in Cork City will play a significant role in climate action, achieving a fair and inclusive transition.
The City Council and other institutions will facilitate individuals and community groups to act.
Cooperative Colloquially Published Direct City Council

Climate Neutrality Commitments

C

The early changes targeted under this strategic priority may be summarised as:

Implement innovative participation measures investigated under Cork City CAP,
Creation of a public platform for climate action which brings together different actors to share ideas, information and to develop partnerships, and
Sustained funding for climate actions implemented by community organisations growing over time.

## Built Environment &amp; Energy

Institutions and building owners in Cork City will work together to accelerate retrofitting and the installation of renewable energy systems.

Innovation will be de-risked for building owners and effectively tested in the city and, where successful, will be rapidly scaled up.
The expansion zones and regeneration areas are flagship, climate-positive development projects that integrate our policies and good practices set out in the City Development Plan, the Green and Blue Infrastructure Strategy, and the Trees Strategy, among others.

The early changes targeted under this strategic priority may be summarised as:

Scale up of retrofitting services for domestic and commercial properties,
Upgrade of electricity distribution network and increased supply to meet growing demand,
Prioritise development in expansion zones, and
Expanding qualified workforce.

## Transport &amp; Mobility

People living and working in Cork City will avail of an excellent sustainable public transport system and accessible, safe active-travel routes, using a car as a last resort.
Provision of multi-modal sustainable transport options for everyone.
Reduced car ownership and significantly reduced car use in the city.

The early changes targeted under this strategic priority may be summarised as:

Accelerating electrification of the private, commercial and public fleet,
Extension of the active travel infrastructure network,
Management of demand for car use,
Increasing availability of shared mobility, and
Smart travel plans for institutions.

## Natural Environment &amp; Resource Management

Green space will be easily accessible on foot by all residents.
The potential for carbon sequestration, nature and biodiversity gain, and climate-
Coeberate Colloque Charolais Care City Council

Climate Neutrality Commitments

risk mitigation through green and blue infrastructure will be maximised in every new development and established neighbourhood.

The city will adopt the reduce-reuse-recycle principle of a circular economy.

The early changes targeted under this strategic priority include:

Increased rate of tree planting.
Enforcement of planning regulations in favour of nature and biodiversity, and
Strengthening participation in the circular economy, recycling, repair and reuse.

The early changes summarised in each of the five strategic priorities are our starting points. These are starting points for a general programme of decarbonisation. Given that Cork City is at an early stage in its transition it is recognised that action in many areas, undertaken simultaneously, is needed. A more detailed and extensive breakdown is presented in our Action Plan in Table B-1.1 summarising impact pathways.

## Stakeholder Engagement for Cork's Transition

Cork City has established an inclusive Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group who are spearheading the citywide transition and who are signatories of our contract. The stakeholder universe is shown in figure 6 and 7 below.

The Leadership Group comprises representation from the business community, civil society, and the public sector. The Leadership Group is chaired by the Chief Executive of Cork City Council and may expand to include additional representation in future.
The local ecosystem of institutions and citizens are partly represented through the Leadership Group and can also collaborate, learn, and share experience through the Climate Neutral Cork Platform.
Commitments to the CCC will be strengthened and materialised through the establishment of Local Green Deals, the tool established by the Intelligent Cities Challenge that Cork City is participating in.
Our enabling environment comprises a wide range of government, state bodies, commercial entities and media organisations that can influence the achievement of our transition. The National Mirror Group is a cross-governmental body bringing together the relevant ministries and technical stake bodies in climate-relevant sectors to support the progress of Ireland's Mission Cities through technical and policy support, coordination and problem solving.

The Climate Neutral Cork Platform is a public participation body that creates space for organisations of all kinds, and individuals to learn from each other, share knowledge, identify collaborators, and map progress to net zero.

## Informal Opportunities for Climate Action

In addition to the establishment of formal structures for discussion, co-creation, partnership, and collaboration, we also encourage informal spaces to arise for dialogue and innovation to take place, and to propagate climate leadership. Our Community Climate Action Fund will help to build networks and promote leadership and participation in concrete actions. The EcoLab component of the Kinship Project at Tramore Valley Park, a unique green space in the city built on a former landfill site, provides one such space for creative engagement. Further funding from sources like Creative Ireland, among others, and the establishment of the Net Zero Cork public platform will increase opportunities for informal leadership of the climate transition to emerge.

# 4. Process and principles

# A Principled Plan

Cork's CCC is a principled plan. It builds on the 2019 Climate Action Charter. While this plan supersedes some of the specific clauses of the Charter, its commitment to a participatory approach that includes residents' voices, strong partnerships including with business and academia, and the mainstreaming of climate action in all our work, such as planning and regulation, and effective monitoring and evaluation, remain highly relevant.

Our principles are:

Cork City residents support climate action. Our proposals will be bold and ambitious. Business as usual will not be enough. We will ensure citizens are at the heart of decision-making throughout the transition.
We will take risks through innovation and learn from our mistakes.
Our transition to net zero will be fair. It will help the most vulnerable groups in the city so that climate action does not push them further behind.
We will seek out creative and high-impact partnerships with our community organisations, businesses, and academic institutions, among others, to drive and accelerate progress.

These principles are established in the Cork City CAP 2024-2029, adopted by the City Council in February 2024. Stakeholders' willingness to engage and our shared principles will be applied consistently throughout the implementation of the CCC.

# Embedding Learning in the CCC

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 9: Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle
#

Deutsche Zellbanks Journal
CNA City Council

Climate Neutrality Commitments

#

Kolb's theory describes two ways for people to grasp knowledge. The first is related to the impact of concrete experiences, the second is thinking about those experiences. Reflective observation, watching what is happening, and active experimentation, or trying new ways of working, are ways to help people to transform their experience into knowledge. Cork City Council will mainstream this approach into its management and review processes, whether wholly internal actions, or those conducted in partnership with others. The model accommodates both formal, documented review of actions taken, and informal individual and group learning processes.

# Cork's Systemic Work Process and Future Iterations of the CCC

Cork City Council has established internal management structures for climate action and the delivery of the Cork City CAP 2024-2029, shown in figure 8 above. These structures will manage and coordinate the work the City Council does on both decarbonisation and adaptation of its own assets and public services, and its influencing, advocacy, and support to other stakeholders in the city as they implement their own actions to achieve net zero. In addition, the structures envisaged to provide city-level governance, the Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group, and the thematic sub-groups, initially addressing buildings and energy, and transport and mobility, will ensure ongoing coordination, collaboration, and resource identification. Engagement with the public and other enterprises and institutions will be supported by the forthcoming Climate Neutral Cork Public Platform. These structures will provide the infrastructure to manage and coordinate our collective work towards net zero and to ensure that the wider community are engaged and have opportunities to join in.

Cork City has embarked upon a phased approach to achievement of net zero, in the context of the EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, set out in figure 10 below.

The City Council will implement the following steps to inform each successive iteration of the CCC:

Updated Baseline Emissions Inventory. The second iteration will draw on the latest available data and address some of the methodological limitations of the 2023 edition, such as related to energy consumption and emissions scopes, while maintaining comparability with the baseline.
Updated Household Survey. The second iteration will be more comprehensive, as survey findings will complement other research work done in the city by our academic partners.
Follow up climate conversations with key stakeholder constituencies in the city and augmented by our ongoing work to stimulate and support public engagement and the creation of a social movement for change.
Review of actions taken during each phase, their impact on emissions, and the identification of lessons from what worked and what did not. This task will draw on the monitoring data from stakeholder groups on the progress of their own actions.
Ongoing work among all stakeholders throughout each phase to co-create and specify new measures, and the means of financing them, to accelerate actions and increase impact.
Statutory Climate Action reporting mechanism is being developed in collaboration with the DECC (Department of the Environment Climate and Communications) and all local authorities in Ireland, with the support of Climate Action Regional Offices. The mechanism co-designed in 2024 will be built upon to monitor and report on progress of the CCC, reducing the risk of duplicated effort.
Signatories re-sign the Commitments Document to show their support for changes that arise from the bi-annual review process.

The Climate Action Unit will collate and share data from all relevant sources and undertake analysis and reporting tasks, with external support from academic and commercial partners where needed. A climate data dashboard will be created for all stakeholders to visualise progress towards net zero, which we expect to be in place by the second iteration of the CCC in 2026.

Monitoring reports will be published annually. Periodic internal and external, independent impact evaluations to review what has changed and how will be commissioned separately.

Halla na Cathrach, Corcaigh - City Hall, Cork - T12 T997

We, the undersigned, hereby commit to collaborate with members of the Climate Neutral Cork Leadership Group to strive to make Cork City climate neutral by 2030. We agree on the joint ambition and commitments, as outlined in the Commitments document. Cork City has established three inter-linked goals for 2030:

Achieve net-zero GHG emissions in line with the EU's Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission's objective, which we consider a minimum of an  $80\%$  emissions reduction over 2018 baseline levels.
Protect and enhance our natural and built environment for future generations, and
Establish best-practice governance to lead the city into a sustainable and prosperous future.

We aim to support these goals with the following actions:

Implementation of our Local Authority Climate Action Plan
Accelerate actions wherever possible
Continue to promote the City's climate neutrality ambition to our communities and stakeholders
