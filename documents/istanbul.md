# Summary

Cities are at the forefront of the battle against climate change, given their dense populations, high energy consumption, and the concentration of networks and resources crucial for driving climate action. The European Green Deal's ambitious targets of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 concentrations and achieving climate neutrality by 2050 underscore the urgent need for cities to lead the charge. The EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission provides a transformative pathway for cities to achieve these goals.

Istanbul recognizes the critical importance of contributing to the European Green Deal and being part of the solution in addressing the escalating climate crisis. The city is committed to creating a fair and inclusive governance model, fostering collaboration across all sectors of society to achieve climate neutrality.

Istanbul's ambition to become carbon neutral by 2030 is a formidable challenge, considering its status as Türkiye's largest metropolis. However, the city's determination and potential to tackle climate change are driving forces behind this endeavour. The Climate City Contract Action Plan builds upon Istanbul's existing action plans and strategies, aligning them with the three core elements of the Climate City Contract. The progress made thus far in preparing this plan inspires confidence in finding even more creative, equitable, and inclusive solutions in the future.

We acknowledge that achieving climate neutrality requires going beyond the priority actions identified in the 2021 Istanbul Climate Change Action Plan (CAP). These actions, while highly impactful, must be complemented by a broader range of initiatives that contribute to the net-zero transition. The economic system's response to these actions will be dynamic, and not all outcomes may be favourable. Therefore, new actions will need to be developed to address any adverse effects.

Furthermore, we recognize the need for an ongoing process of developing new actions and adapting existing ones to meet the evolving needs of a dynamic socio-economic system.

Within this framework, the updated and improved priority strategies from the CAP, along with their corresponding carbon reduction quantities, will be presented.

The implementation of the outlined CCC actions is projected to achieve a substantial reduction around 80% in greenhouse gas emissions. However, a remaining 20% gap is anticipated. To address this gap, further efforts can be planned, focusing on areas such as enhancing carbon capture and storage technologies, promoting nature-based solutions, and exploring innovative approaches to decarbonization.

Istanbul is confident that its existing capacity, perspective, and ambition in addressing climate change will enable it to become a unique living laboratory in its pursuit of climate neutrality.

# 1 Introduction

Istanbul, a vibrant megacity straddling two continents, faces a dual challenge: managing rapid urbanization and economic growth while mitigating the impacts of climate change. The city's 2030 climate neutrality target encompasses its entire administrative territory, aiming to achieve an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across all related sectors.

Key data underscores the scale of this undertaking. Istanbul's registered population of 16 million, coupled with its significant industrial and commercial activity, results in substantial emissions. The city's unique geographical location and its role as a major economic and tourism hub further amplify the complexities of achieving climate neutrality.

This Climate City Contract Action Plan builds upon Istanbul's existing climate policies and strategies, including the Istanbul CAP and the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP). In addition, Istanbul is developing its Green City Action Plan (GCAP) which defines the key environmental challenges and actions to overcome these. Climate City Contract Action Plan leverages these foundations to bridge the gap between current emissions reduction efforts and the 2030 climate neutrality target. Moreover, CCC study also focuses on the investment perspective of climate actions. Similarly, SECAP and GCAP studies also includes the required capital investment scale of actions. However, CCC study presents it as a separate report with more detail.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Figure 1: Climate Policies and Strategies of Istanbul

The development of this Action Plan has been a collaborative endeavour, involving extensive engagement with internal and external stakeholders. This participatory approach ensured that the plan reflects the diverse perspectives and priorities of the city's residents, businesses, and institutions.

In addition, IMM will work for the implementation of the CCC's strategic goals and actions in accordance with the co-creation approach with a wide range of stakeholders from district municipalities, public institutions and organisations, the private sector, academia, professional chambers and many NGOs.

At this point, the Istanbul Climate Platform (ICP) mentioned in the commitment document will be used and efforts will be made to carry out regular monitoring activities to keep the platform alive in order to accelerate the process and maintain communication among stakeholders.

The Action Plan focuses on the priority actions identified in the CAP, with additional measures required to achieve the accelerated 2030 target. The Istanbul CCC will be a living document that will be updated iteratively to achieve the 2030 target. Future iterations will delve deeper into sector-specific strategies, implementation plans, and financing mechanisms.

Istanbul recognizes that achieving climate neutrality requires a holistic approach, encompassing not only emissions reduction but also adaptation to the inevitable impacts of climate change. Besides, all sector-based barriers and opportunities are summarised under 'Module 2.3 (A3) Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality' Section. The Action Plan thus outlines a comprehensive roadmap, integrating mitigation and adaptation efforts across key sectors such as energy, buildings, transport, and waste management.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

The jurisdiction of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality was determined as the provincial administrative border in 2004 according to the Metropolitan Municipality Law No. 5216. With this provision, the jurisdiction of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality became  $5460.85\mathrm{km}^2$  (5343.22 km² land area + 117.63 km² lake area). The GHG inventory encompasses the entire geographical area of Istanbul (5460.85 km²), encompassing all 39 districts under the jurisdiction of the IMM.

# 2 (A) Current State of Climate Action

This section outlines the city's baseline in its journey towards achieving climate neutrality and provides an overview of the city's current environmental standing, detailing the commitments and strategies of key local businesses and stakeholders. By analysing the progress made so far and identifying existing gaps, this action plan sets the stage for understanding the necessary actions and pathways to accelerate climate action, driving the city closer to its goals.

# 2.1 (A-1) Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Istanbul, a metropolis bridging Europe and Asia, faces a formidable challenge: reconciling its rapid economic and population growth with the urgent need to combat climate change. The city's 2019 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory, calculated by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality team and validated by the C40 Cities network, reveals a sobering reality. The GHG inventory encompasses the entire geographical area of Istanbul,  $5,460.85\mathrm{km}^2$ , encompassing all 39 districts under the jurisdiction of the IMM. This comprehensive scope ensures a holistic assessment of greenhouse gas emissions across the city. The 2019 Istanbul GHG inventory encompassed the calculation of carbon dioxide  $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$ , methane  $(\mathrm{CH}_{4})$ , and nitrous oxide  $(\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O})$  greenhouse gas emissions, expressed in their carbon dioxide equivalent  $(\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\mathrm{e})$  values. Total emissions reached approximately 50.9 million metric tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalent  $(\mathrm{MtCO}_{2}\mathrm{e})$ , translating to a per capita footprint of  $3.3\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ .

# 2.1.1 Inventory Modelling Methodology

Overview: The modelling methodology followed the processes set out in the C40 Climate Action Planning Framework, using the supporting tools provided by C40. The process assesses the impact of climate mitigation strategies on cities such as Istanbul by using city, national and regional data to build up credible emissions reduction scenarios.

Tools: In order to produce the emissions pathways produced in this report an extensive modelling exercise was carried out in the Pathways tool - a customisation of The Climate action for URBan sustainability (CURB) tool that addresses the specific needs of C40's Climate Action Planning programme.

Process: The first stage of the modelling process is to develop a robust emissions inventory baseline. Prior to the 2021 Istanbul Climate Action Plan workstream, IMM prepared a baseline consistent with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC) standard.

|  Sector | Scope 1 | Scope 2 | Scope 3 included in Basic/Basic+  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | (I.4.4) |  |   |
|  Transportation | All emissions | B | B  |
|  Waste | Generated in the city (all III.X.1 and III.X.2) | B | NA  |
|   | Generated outside the city (all III.X.3) | Territorial only | NA  |
|  IPPU | All IV emissions | B+ | NA  |
|  AFOLU | All V emissions | B+ | NA  |

Istanbul chose to adopt a 'Basic' inventory which requires reporting of Scope 1 and Scope 2. Furthermore, Istanbul will make an effort to calculate according to "GPC Basic +" inventory approach for the future. To produce the emissions, baseline an activity-based approach was mostly used, where the city energy activity across the key sectors of energy, buildings, transport, waste and wastewater were multiplied by proper city emissions factors, e.g. grid factor or IPCC-compliant emissions factors to calculate the associated emissions. In some cases, the total emissions for some sub-sectoral activities were already known due to ongoing reporting systems and were input as final values.

The greenhouse gas emission inventory of Istanbul has been calculated using the formula adapted from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) "Tier-1" and "Tier-2" methodology within the Istanbul's city boundaries.

Carbon Dioxide Emissions (t CO₂) = ΣsΣf {fuel consumption sf (MWh) x CO₂ emission factor f}

(t CO₂e/MWh)

s = sector

f = energy carrier

The greenhouse gas emissions and global warming potentials included in the inventory are taken from the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5). Emission factors used in the inventory are taken from IPCC Emission Factors, except for the national electricity grid emission factor calculated for Türkiye. The average emission factor from electricity is taken from the Primary Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emission Coefficients of Electricity.

This inventory, along with additional baseline data such as population, GDP, population growth, and GDP growth, is uploaded into the Pathways tool. The data was prepared in collaboration with IMM and the relevant city departments, including Environment, Transport, and Infrastructure.

## 2.1.2 GHG Emissions

The inventory paints a picture of a city grappling with the consequences of its energy choices and consumption patterns. The stationary energy sector, encompassing residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, emerges as the largest contributor, responsible for a substantial 63% of total emissions. This is closely followed by the transport sector, accounting for 28% of emissions, primarily driven by the reliance on diesel-fuelled private cars and buses. While the waste sector has the smallest share (9%) to the overall emissions, it represents an area where IMM has the potential to implement impactful actions in a timely manner, given its authority and capacity for action.

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)
Scope 1: Emissions from sources located within the city boundary
Scope 2: Emissions occurring as a consequence of the use of grid-supplied electricity, heat, steam and/or cooling within the city boundary

The figure below shows that emissions in the stationary energy sector are split around  $62\%$  for 'Scope 1' (direct fuel combustion) and  $38\%$  for 'Scope 2' (electricity consumed). Emissions from electricity use are high in Istanbul due to the grid reliance on coal. Electricity use represents the majority portion of the emissions from commercial buildings and manufacturing industries, whereas Scope 1 fuel use represents the majority in residential buildings (8.4  $\mathrm{MtCO_2e}$ ), predominantly due to natural gas use in homes for cooking, hot water and heating.

The transportation sector is responsible for  $28\%$  of total emissions and the sole most significant source, on-road transportation. Diesel oil is the dominant fuel source of emissions in road transportation (11.6  $\mathrm{MtCO_2e}$ ) compared to gasoline (1.8  $\mathrm{MtCO_2e}$ ) and LPG (830  $\mathrm{ktCO_2e}$ ). This activity comes mostly from private cars and a significant number of buses. The 2019 inventory includes emissions from rail and water-borne navigation, but these represent less than  $1\%$  of total transportation emissions. This reflects the complexity and smaller policy influence over emissions in this sector held by the city.

Waste represents the remaining  $9\%$  of emissions in Istanbul, with the vast majority  $(89\%)$  of these coming from solid waste disposal. The remaining  $11\%$  of waste emissions are allocated across wastewater treatment  $(5\%)$ , industrial incineration  $(3\%)$  and composting  $(2\%)$ .

Figure 4: GHG Emissions according to the GPC BASIC Methodology

Greenhouse gas emission inventory calculations are reported to the CDP Cities (Carbon Disclosure Project) network, one of the official reporting platforms of GCoM.

Istanbul was awarded an "A" score as a result of the evaluations carried out by the network on the "Provincial Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory for 2022 and the activities carried out by IMM in 2022 that contribute to combating climate change", which was entered into the system in 2023. A List cities create climate momentum by taking 4 times more climate mitigation and adaptation measures than non-A List cities. In 2023, only  $13\%$  of the cities whose climate actions were scored by CDP were able to achieve an A score. For a city to achieve an A score, it must have a city-wide greenhouse gas emission inventory, publish a climate change action plan, complete a climate risk and vulnerability assessment, have climate change adaptation targets, and publicize them through the CDP Platform. Istanbul was included in the "CDP Cities A List" as one of the 119 cities with the highest score.

Istanbul's commitment to a sustainable future is evident in its existing and planned climate strategies. Through initiatives focused on energy efficiency, renewable energy adaption, and sustainable transport, the city aims to curb its emissions' growth. However, the 2021 Climate Action Plan and subsequent analyses based on the C40 Pathways tool reveal a stark truth: these efforts alone were insufficient to meet the ambitious goal of carbon neutrality even by 2050. Despite the considerable challenges, IMM is committed to working with all key stakeholders who have a vital role to play in driving the city's transformation forward.

After completing Climate Action Plan in 2021, we continued to monitor the city-wide GHG emissions and published them in our Climate Monitoring Reports.

# 2.1.3 Istanbul's Journey Towards Climate Neutrality

Recognizing the urgency of the climate crisis, Istanbul has set forth a bold ambition: to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. This necessitates a paradigm shift, moving beyond incremental improvements to embrace transformative change across all sectors. The city's Sustainable Energy and Climate Action

Plan outlines measures for energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, and sustainable urban development. While crucial, these actions must be complemented by broader systemic changes to achieve the desired reductions. Initially aiming for a 52% emissions reduction by 2030, Istanbul has now raised its ambition through the Climate City Contract, targeting carbon neutrality by the same year. Finally, Istanbul has increased this target even further and increased our 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target to 80% compared to the base year 2019. However, a remaining 20% gap is expected.

This ambitious goal underscores the city's commitment to accelerating climate action and leading the way towards a sustainable and resilient future.

![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)
Figure 5: Istanbul Climate Action Plan and Related Other Policies

IMM Climate Change Directorate and other IMM departments carry out projects that support the city's climate neutrality. These projects, which are carried out in cooperation with various partners and stakeholders, play an active role in the dissemination of renewable energy and climate change issues throughout the city.

Istanbul applied to the Mission's call for pilot cities with the project 'Green and Carbon Neutral Building Transition Guide-Istanbul Model (Build4GreenIST)' and was selected as the first pilot city from Türkiye.

The motivating point of this highly inspiring project is to address the city's main problems, earthquake risk, and climate crisis, together. The project will provide a guide for this transformation towards a green and carbon neutral building concept that is resistant to climate change; while carrying out the inevitable urban transformation works in the city where earthquake risk and old buildings are too many. The aim is to highlight the positive impact that the addition of climate-friendly practices to the urban transformation works in the city will have in terms of climate change and renewable/efficient energy use during the transformation process, which is very necessary for the city. The studies will be carried out using a methodology that involves almost all the city's stakeholders in the field of building energy. The guide, which will be produced at the end of the project, is intended to provide effective benefits and awareness for the city's decarbonisation efforts.

The Build4GreenIST project will provide a guide to ensure that buildings renovated as part of urban regeneration are green and carbon neutral. It will also monitor energy consumption in buildings in a pilot area through sensors and encourage behavioural change of citizens towards energy efficiency. A mobile application called GreenIST is being developed for this purpose. In addition, the trainings and conferences organised under the project for a wide range of stakeholders such as citizens, practitioners, local government representatives are also contributing significantly to inclusive awareness efforts. The project will also include the development of business and finance models to bring a holistic approach to this opportunity for change.

Another project that is carried out by IMM Climate Change Directorate is The UP2030 Horizon Project. Within the scope of the UP2030 Project, the solar energy (PV) potential of building roofs in the Kadıköy district will be calculated, and the use of clean energy produced in the region within the building without storage and the transfer of the remaining energy to light electric vehicles in urban transportation will be modeled with digital twin technology. Within the scope of the project, attention will also be drawn to the fact that renewable energy systems can be used by citizens in their daily life activities with PV panel integrated urban furniture to be installed in a square/park with high human density in Kadıköy. Many workshops were established to be able to exchange views with relevant stakeholders on the basic prototypes of the project. Furthermore, many surveys were made in the pilot area for citizen engagements.

Apart from these, Procure and Neuthralpath projects (Horizon Projects), which are actively carried out by IMM Energy and Lighting Directorate, also refer to studies such as Positive Energy Zones.

The "Procurement of Innovative Solutions for 100% Renewable Energy Use in Buildings" (PROCURE) project, carried out in partnership with IMM and Özyeğin University in Istanbul, 9 partners in 7 countries (Slovenia, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Israel, Türkiye, Italy) under the main title of "Low Carbon Emission, Climate Resilient Future" and "Safe, Clean and Efficient Energy". Within the scope of the project, it was aimed to meet the energy needs of the buildings with 100% renewable energy by applying innovative technologies and original solutions to existing public buildings selected from 6 different cities, including Istanbul. Within this scope, a bakery building from the 19th century Ottoman Empire was restored and transformed into a building using 100% renewable energy.

The Neuthralpath project, in which Istanbul is a partner, is paving the way towards climate neutral cities through the development of Positive and Clean Energy Districts (PCEDs) and the co-design of efficient, climate-friendly solutions. The partner cities of Istanbul, Ghent and Vantaa have expressed their commitment to work with Zaragoza and Dresden to support and share the process of decarbonisation (by 2030), while paving the way to achieve the same long-term goals.

Istanbul's journey towards climate neutrality is not without its challenges. Systemic barriers, ranging from institutional fragmentation and limited financial resources to public awareness and behavioural shifts, pose formidable obstacles. Yet, the city's rich history of resilience and innovation, coupled with a strong commitment to collaboration and stakeholder engagement, offers a beacon of hope. By fostering a green and just recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, investing in sustainable infrastructure, and

# 2.3 (A-3) Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

Istanbul is the most populated city in Türkiye, an ancient city as well as an economic and artistic centre that grew organically rather than in a planned way. It is a trade centre connecting Europe and Asia as well as the Black Sea countries and the Mediterranean. Although traditionally a centre of industry, in recent decades its economy has become more dominated by the service and finance sectors. While the production facilities of companies are mostly out of town, the administrative centres remain. The city is home to a population of 16 million inhabitants and hosts over 16 million foreign tourists annually. The city is also estimated to host nearly 2,5 million undocumented refugees. Istanbul generates 30.4% of Türkiye's GDP.

Table 10: (A-3.1) Description of Urban Systems, Systemic Barriers, and Opportunities

|  Systems and Systematic Barriers and Opportunities  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Barriers | Under the title (2.3.1), the barriers are given under the sectors of : • Transportation • Energy • Wastewater and Waste System  |
|  Opportunities | Under the title (2.3.2), the opportunities are given under below listed titles : • Integrated low-carbon public transportation system • District heating and cooling • Renewable energy • Energy efficient buildings • Circular economy initiatives • Vibrant social and entrepreneurship potential of the city  |

# 2.3.1 Systems and Systematic Barriers

The most critical domains relevant to the city's climate neutrality targets are buildings-energy, transportation, waste, and water-wastewater. The city is also home to the headquarters of many of the biggest companies in Türkiye, the mobilization of these companies, alongside the positive individual efforts of its vast population, can significantly contribute to achieving both the city's and the country's climate targets. For all mitigation projects, the scale and existing complex structure of Istanbul presents a challenge in finding and utilising data to enable smart solutions. Data availability, ownership, access rights and integrated protocols are bottlenecks. The monitoring of ongoing efforts often does not suffice, making the optimisation of interventions a challenge.

# 2.3.1.1 Transportation

The main stakeholders are IMM, UKOME (Transportation Coordination Center – consists of representatives from local government, central government and private operators), Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MoTI), Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change (MoEUCC), IETT, Metro Istanbul Inc., City Lines Inc., Ispark Inc., Isbak Inc., Belbim Inc., and private public transport operators as well as citizens.

# Physical barriers:

Istanbul's rapid urban sprawl resulted in longer travel distances and increased car dependency. Although, car ownership in Istanbul is relatively at low levels compared to developed countries/cities, the high share of car use and traffic congestion are among the main challenges.
ISTANBUL METROPOLITAN MUNICIPALITY

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

The hilly geography of the city spread on both sides of the Bosphorus, narrow streets and even narrower pavements seems to discourage walking and cycling, yet the dense and mixed land use promotes active modes. However, due to poorly designed and several barriers on pavements, Istanbul's walkability is considered as low.

## Institutional / regulatory barriers:

Coordination and cooperation across metropolitan, regional, and national institutions are generally poor. Tasks and responsibilities regarding transportation decisions across central and local governments are highly fragmented and overlap.
Traffic management and road safety are under central government control. However, IMM and Istanbul Provincial Police Department are in coordination.
IMM does not have legislative and executive power on developing and implementing regulations and incentives on high-polluting vehicles and energy-efficient vehicles. These actions are carried out by central government and local bodies of central government in Istanbul. However, there are no emission-based restriction for the vehicles entering the city.

## Infrastructural barriers:

Due to insufficient surface area to be dedicated to rail transport, metro systems are the options left for widespread public transport projects. However, these systems are time consuming to plan and construct.
Electrification of private vehicles will require increasing the capacity of the city's electricity infrastructure. Widespread vehicle charging infrastructure should also be developed in the city for widespread decarbonization of the private vehicles.
Growing trend towards periphery areas has a negative impact on the capacity and service reliability of public transport

## Financial barriers:

Funding of large-scale transportation infrastructure projects requires careful allocation of existing financial instruments in a limited budget. It is not well coordinated and sustained at national, regional, and local levels.

## Social and behavioural barriers:

With the exception of Istanbul SUMP (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan), previous transportation plans had a focus on traffic and didn't cover the needs of vulnerable groups.
Gender-based violence and harassment stands as a significant threat on the use of public spaces and public transport.
As public transport journeys often take at least as long as private car trips, people prefer to travel in the comfort of their cars instead of using the crowded public transport.
The electrification agenda for public transport, marine transport, and energy reduction needs capacity building and financial incentives.

## 2.3.1.2 Energy

Energy systems that are relevant in the city's decarbonisation are production, transmission and consumption of energy for stationary uses. Electricity supply is heavily dominated by the national grid. Local distributed renewable energy production is nearly non-existent.
ISTANBUL METROPOLITAN MUNICIPALITY

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Space heating is mostly provided by natural gas and individual gas boilers. District heating is limited to a small number of social housings.

## Institutional / regulatory barriers:

Türkiye's climate targets require 41% reduction of GHGs from 2012 baseline, which is not as ambitious as IMM's targets that require carbon neutrality by 2030. The emissions from national electricity grid will be a barrier for the city's targets, particularly considering the increased electrification of the city's essential energy consumption such as space heating and transportation.
Regulations and incentives for distributed renewable energy production are developed by MENR, and they lack the attractiveness needed by an ambitious target.
Subsidized energy prices and policy framework causes longer payback periods than EU counterparts as energy prices in Türkiye are often lower in comparison to investment costs of renewable energy. The policy framework also presents challenges in creating revenue from renewable energy, deterring small investors.

## Financial barriers:

Funding of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments are only accessible to residents and companies that already has access to finance. Funding for residents and companies/institutions that don't already have access to finance should be developed.

## Social and behavioural barriers:

Rooftop PV systems are underutilised in Istanbul. Lack of public awareness and publicly available examples are a barrier for fast adoption of rooftop PV systems.

## 2.3.1.3 Wastewater and Waste System

### Institutional / regulatory barriers:

Distribution of responsibilities and authority between district municipalities and the metropolitan municipality for municipal waste collection reduces the efficiency and integration of waste collection services leading to inadequate waste reduction and recycling, as well as missing of opportunities.

### Infrastructure barriers:

Currently only 45% of the city's wastewater is treated in biological and advanced biological treatment plants. This barrier can be overcome by establishing advanced wastewater treatment plants to treat 100% of the city's wastewater.
Capacity of biomethanisation and composting plants to treat organic fraction of the solid waste should be increased to cover 100% of the biodegradable waste generated in the city.
Waste recycling in the city is very limited and should be increased to reduce the emissions of the existing incineration plant.

## 2.3.2 Systems and Systematic Opportunities

### Integrated low-carbon public transportation system:

The city already has an extensive public transport system. However, this system has plenty of room to improve with regard to carbon emissions, coverage of rail transport, connectivity and comfort level. Further improvement on these aspects, supported by better walking and micromobility infrastructure, as
ISTANBUL METROPOLITAN MUNICIPALITY

#

well as improvements on low carbon logistics services can help reduce transport related emissions significantly.

# District heating and cooling:

Early estimations show Istanbul to have adequate low temperature geothermal resources to provide heat and cooling to cover the existing heating and cooling needs of the city. Development of district heating and cooling systems to cover the city can help mitigate natural gas related emissions of the city.

# Renewable Energy:

Even though Istanbul is one of the lowest solar potential cities in the country, the current PV system investment costs and energy costs make rooftop (and other urban) PV systems economically attractive. Rough estimations show that the potential capacity of rooftop PVs can cover a significant portion of the city's current need for electricity. Encouraging and enabling the city's residents to invest in these systems through appropriate incentives can lead to very fast deployment, and the associated emission reductions.

Istanbul also is among the cities with highest wind potential in Türkiye considering land based and offshore potential. Capturing this potential would reduce the emissions of the city. However, environmental and social impacts of these plants should be evaluated carefully.

# Energy efficient buildings:

Most of existing buildings in Istanbul have low efficiency and need to be either structurally renewed or strengthened for seismic risks anyway. During this renewal deep renovation with regard to energy efficiency can also be achieved in line with new BEP-TR standards, leading to significant improvement of energy performance of buildings. If the opportunity for enforcing NZEB standards in new buildings can be seized through incentives, much faster decarbonization can be achieved.

# Circular economy initiatives:

Promotion of circular economy through waste reduction, reuse and recycling programs have the potential to increase the added value services in the city as well as reduce GHG emissions.
Wastewater reuse is very limited. Reuse of some of the wastewater and harvested rainwater would reduce the energy consumed to transfer water from catchment areas as far away as  $200\mathrm{km}$ . This could be achieved by developing regulations to enforce the use of advanced treated wastewater for non-sanitary purposes (irrigation, industry, cooling etc) where reusable wastewater and harvested rainwater is available.

# Vibrant social and entrepreneurship potential of the city:

The city has a vibrant population, with an entrepreneurial culture, which can be triggered to develop initiatives and businesses offering services and solutions to speed the decarbonisation of the city with an appropriate and well distributed incentive system.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

(B) Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

The primary resource for outlining the steps towards carbon neutrality by 2030 is the Istanbul 2021 Climate Change Action Plan, developed within the C40 framework, and the Pathways model that underpins its calculations. Utilizing this model, the city's greenhouse gas emissions inventory was established, and a 'business as usual' scenario was projected for 2030, 2040, and 2050.

In addition to the 'business as usual' scenario, emission projections were made for various other scenarios leading to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. These scenarios identified sectors where reductions are feasible and generated scenarios containing sector-specific targets for achieving these reductions. Subsequently, actions were defined to meet these targets, and priority actions were selected to complete the Action Plan. It is important to note that implementing solely the priority actions will not be sufficient to achieve the net-zero carbon target. It is crucial for various stakeholder groups, in addition to IMM, to modify their activities in alignment with this goal and/or adapt them to the impacts of climate change.

Within the scope of the Climate City Contract (CCC), scenarios were also generated, assuming that the targets defined in the existing CAP would be achieved earlier than initially planned, thereby aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. Moreover, the action development efforts within the CCC adhered to the framework of priority actions identified in the CAP.

Based on these assumptions, the Action Plan and Investment Plan documents under the CCC will present the priority actions outlined in the CAP, including information such as investment costs and additional benefits of these actions.

We are aware that solely relying on the priority actions defined in the CAP may not be sufficient to meet the revised targets for achieving net-zero carbon emissions.

It's important to remember that while the actions identified in the CAP are the most impactful ones for reaching net-zero, they need to be complemented by other actions that may have lower individual reduction impacts but still contribute to the overall net-zero transformation.

It is expected that the economic system will react to the implementation of each action, and not all of these reactions will necessarily be beneficial to the net-zero transition. Therefore, new actions will need to be developed to counteract any adverse effects of these responses.

Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that the development of new actions and the modification of existing ones should be an ongoing process to respond to the needs of a dynamic socio-economic system.

Within the scope outlined above, carbon reduction quantities will be presented based on the updated priority targets in the CAP. Additionally, the reports will address other actions necessary to achieve the net-zero carbon goal by 2030.

To design the impact pathways, the categories below were longlisted for each impact pathway stage. This was to ensure consistency and comparability – where required – across different fields of action. The categories were chosen and defined to describe the potential outputs and outcomes of transformative climate action and investment; aligned with terminology and concepts used in existing IMM plans and policies such as the CAP, SECAP, and GCAP.

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)
Figure 7: (B-1.2) Description of Impact Pathways

Starting with the fields of action – which are aligned to the sectoral categories used in the emissions modelling – the impact pathways for each field of action were defined with the following process:

Selection of systemic levers that are relevant to progress in the field of action;
Selection of early changes required to enable the systemic lever in the field of action; and
IETANBUL METROPOLITAN MUNICIPALITY

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

Based on the field of action and systemic lever, highlight the potential late outcomes, direct impacts related to emissions mitigation, and indirect impacts via co-benefits generated.

Across the impact pathways, the categories provide an understanding of the potential emissions reductions and other outcomes related to adaptation and circular economy, but also of the enabling governance actions needed to address the local sociopolitical context and systemic barriers. The categories listed under systemic levers and early changes (1-2 years) are particular indications of the current local context that actions need to consider and respond to; including the strategies, barriers and opportunities.

Finally, articulating the indirect impacts or co-benefits of the field of action and enacting the related systemic levers provide a sense of the less tangible results of climate action. This will support case-making for all actions to be implemented to create a more equitable municipality for all to live and work in.

In summary, the impact pathways at a high-level demonstrate the types of short- and long-term climate action priorities to ensure that specific climate actions are prioritised, resourced and implemented. The same categories and considerations – especially around late outcomes (3-4 years), direct impacts (emission reductions), and indirect impacts (co-benefits) – were used in the modelling, analysis and detailing of the actions to achieve IMM's 2030 Climate Neutrality Commitments. The same terminology is carried forward into the subsequent analyses and reporting across Modules B and C.

|   | Action description | Rooftop solar PV systems in Istanbul are gaining traction for commercial buildings, but their adoption is still evolving. There are very few installations in private structures. The total capacity is negligibly small. The city's potential for solar energy is good due to its geographical location. According to the high-level analysis, the estimated potential for rooftop solar PV systems is around 26.5 GW, which may approximately produce 29,000 GWh per year.

This action aims to increase public awareness and the installation percentage of rooftop PV systems in private buildings. In addition, building integrated generation offers benefits such as:
• By decentralizing energy production, the system can reduce the impact of grid failures and improve overall system reliability
• Lower transmission and distribution costs, along with potential savings on energy bills for consumers
• Communities and individuals can generate their own power, reducing dependence on centralized energy sources
• Offer training programmes specifically designed for women on the installation and maintenance of these systems  |

|   |  Action type | Mitigation  |
|   |  Action description | The water distribution system in Istanbul suffers from water losses and inefficiencies in energy consumption as a result of the unbalanced distribution of water resources and population density, as well as the steep topography and drinking water network construction. As a consequence of recent work, the drinking water network's loss and leakage rate has been reduced to 18.94%. This figure is lower than Türkiye's average and lower than the loss and leakage rates in several European countries. However, given the magnitude of the city's population, it appears that lower numbers should be pursued. Currently, approximately 76% of ISKI's energy is used for water supply. In this sense, this action aims to improve the management of supply lines and drinking water network with the implications of smart systems. To monitor this action the following indicators should be observed: ·Loss-Leakage Ratio ·Amount of Consumption; Amount of Changed System ·Using the Digital Tracking System  |

| Action outline | Action name | Electrifying buses Replacement and conversion of IETT and private vehicle fleet – HIZRAY: New Generation Express Metro |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action type | Mitigation |
| Action description | Istanbul's transport network consists of three tiers of modes. In the first tier, slow modes such as walking, cycling and e-mobility feed second tier public transport systems such as dolmuş, minibuses, buses and trams. These second tier public transport systems, in turn, feed higher-capacity third tier public transport systems such as metro and metrobus. HIZRAY is a fourth tier high level express metro line that will form the main transport corridor of Istanbul fed by all these systems. The HIZRAY project represents a new approach to the rail system network, offering a new generation of express metro service. It comprises a high-speed 74.5 km rail line with 13 underground stations. The design speed of HIZRAY has been set at 140 km/h, and the anticipated average speed will be 90 km/h. This will enable the longest distance on the line, Beylikdüzü - Sabiha Gökçen, to be completed in approximately 55 minutes. HIZRAY is expected to carry 1.5 million passengers per day, with an estimated 550 million passengers per year. HIZRAY will be the main transport corridor of Istanbul and will have positive effect on reducing the GHG emissions. |

| Action outline | Action name | Electrifying buses Replacement and conversion of IETT and private vehicle fleet – Charging Infrastructure Feasibility Study and Pilot Applications |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action type | Mitigation |
| Action description | TurkSTAT data indicates that there are 114,156 electric cars in Türkiye as of May 2024. A review of the situation in Istanbul reveals that the number of electric cars in the city is 46,677 as of 2023. According to the Electric Vehicle and Charging Infrastructure Projection published by EMRA, the total number of electric vehicles in Türkiye is expected to be between 200,000 and 360,000 in 2025, between 775,000 and 1,700,000 in 2030 and between 1,800,000 and 4,200,000 in 2035. Meanwhile, the total number of charging points is projected to reach between 35,000 and 62,000 in 2025, 83,000 and 180,000 in 2030, and 145,000 and 350,000 in 2035. In light of these projections and the current situation, it can be reasonably assumed that the electric vehicle (EV) sector in Türkiye will experience significant growth over the next decade. This action proposes a feasibility study to ascertain the roles that IMM can undertake in parallel with the development of the electric vehicle sector. The objective of this study is to identify the areas in which IMM and its subsidiaries can contribute. Moreover, this action proposes a pilot implementation in a selected metro station. |

| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Mitigation  |
|   |  Action description | The transportation sector is responsible for 28% of total emissions and the single most significant source, on-road transportation. Diesel oil is the dominant fuel source of emissions in road transportation (11.6 MtCO2e) compared to gasoline (1.8 MtCO2e) and LPG (830 ktCO2e). This activity comes mostly from private cars and a significant number of buses. The 2019 inventory includes emissions from rail and water-borne navigation, but these represent less than 1% of total transportation emissions. For this reason, it is significantly important to encourage fuel switch of private transport modes such as cars and trucks to support the achieve City's net zero targets. Even though IMM has limited power on affecting people's and institutions travel choices, IMM can positively influence the fuel switch by increasing the awareness and developing incentive mechanisms.  |

|   | Action description | Historically, urban transport policies in Istanbul have prioritized motorized transport over other active transport modes (e.g., walking and cycling). On the other hand, the city's rapid expansion has made it challenging to allocate space for pedestrian walkways and dedicated cycling lanes. These resulted in inadequate facilities for pedestrians and cyclists. This action proposes the expansion of cycle lanes within the city. To monitor this action the following indicators should be observed: ○ Shared Cycle Path Length ○ Non-Shared Cycle Path Length ○ Number of Bicycle Users ○ Number of Bicycles Sold ○ Number of Bicycle Stations ○ Share of Cycling Journeys in Typical Distribution ○ Ratio of Bicycle Path Length to Motor Vehicle Road Length ○ Number of Public Transport Stations with Sheltered Bicycle Parking Facilities ○ Number of Serious Accidents Categorized by Significance of Accidents Engaged by Cyclists  |

|   | Action description | Responsibilities about municipal waste collection are distributed between IMM and district municipalities. Commercial companies are also allowed to sell their waste to licensed recycling companies directly. However, food waste, due to its quickly decomposable nature, costly processing requirements, and low secondary revenue, is not an attractive waste type for recycling companies, and often remains in the municipal waste mix, contaminating other wastes while quickly decomposing. IMM is currently running a programme of collecting food wastes from commercial sources such as hotels, restaurants, ready meal companies and weekly street markets with mutual agreements with district municipalities and the company itself. IMM is looking into ways to extend this operation to a wider base of food-waste producers and streamline it to reduce operation costs. In this sense, this action proposes the development of programs to deal with existing problems.  |

The actions were modelled using the C40 Cities' Pathways tool, which was also used in the modelling for the emissions scenarios and targets (for 2030, 2040 and 2050) in the CAP. For the CCC Action and Investment Plans, an iteration of the model was used: accelerating the ambition of actions to achieve net zero emissions in 2030. The target of net zero emissions in 2030 was defined as  $80\%$  absolute emissions reductions compared to the 2019 base year emissions.

Actions modelled include the priority actions listed in Tables B-2.1 and B-2.2, as well as additional actions to encompass ambitious and transformative climate action across the energy, buildings, industry, transport, waste and water sectors. These all contribute to the achievement of net zero emissions in 2030:

Figure 9: Major Remaining Emissions

The residual emissions resulting from socioeconomic activity related to the built environment is mainly due to the Scope 2 emissions generated by non-renewable sources of grid electricity. Whilst most of the grid electricity in 2030 will be generated via renewables and nuclear,  $19\%$  of grid mix will still be attributed to natural gas according to national strategies. This is to be expected in many cities and even mandated by some national governments to ensure that energy generation has redundancies given that some renewable energy sources could be intermittent depending on meteorological conditions.

This means that despite actions to electrify and improve the energy efficiency of fixtures and appliances across residential, commercial, institutional, industrial and other buildings in Istanbul, there will still be emissions occurring in emissions categories I.1-6. For the same reasons as above, there will continue to be emissions resulting from rail transit (II.2) since it utilises grid energy for operations. Due to the continued use of natural gas, there will also continue to be fugitive emissions at the energy generation stage (I.8). Some of these residual emissions could be addressed by further policies and programmes at the municipal and national level to ensure that energy generation via natural gas is as efficient as possible.

While the CCC actions and modelled mode- and fuel-shifts are highly ambitious, there will still be some private passenger and public transit vehicles using internal combustion engines (ICE) that use petrol or diesel in the local fleet. This is to be expected not only due to practical and technological reasons, but also to ensure that there is a just climate transition that considers local needs and existing socioeconomic interdependencies in an equitable way. In addition, the electrification of local fleets still requires grid energy consumption, which as described before is not fully decarbonised in 2030.

Some of these residual emissions could be addressed by further policies and programmes at the municipal and national level to encourage further mode-shift to electric public transit and active mobility, as well as actions to ensure that the energy sources for electric public transit is decarbonised.

# 4 (C) Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

# 4.1 (C-1) Governance Innovation Interventions

Istanbul is vast in population, diversity and complexity. Reconciling climate neutrality efforts with the multiple layers of urban issues in this context requires the commitment of many stakeholders at various levels. Interventions to the city's governance structure need to be targeted, assigning specific roles to focus on climate related actions and establish relations with relevant units.

Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

Progressing towards climate neutrality is prominent in multiple levels of policy that impact Istanbul: from national legislation to alignment with EU acquis, on to sectoral targets and the shared ambition of multiple cities in Türkiye. Even so, Istanbul comes forward with an even more ambitious commitment on this path as signatory to climate initiatives including this Climate City Contract.

The main IMM Climate Governance Model is illustrated in the chart below. This structure defines the responsibilities and relationships between the units of IMM and the goal of the plan is to enhance it with a clear focus on climate neutrality. Units carry extended efforts for citizen participation and engaging civil society, which are not illustrated here. It is also worth noting that the first three levels of this diagram run governance processes with the central government, adopt national policies and communicate investment priorities from the local level.

While IMM is committed to its climate goals, and a trackable governance model exists, improvements can accelerate the implementation of actions. The participatory processes of IMM can benefit from targeted actions specifically for climate. The authorities responsible for sectors related to climate actions can benefit from focused, trained staff to oversee the adoption of actions. Communication and decision-making processes can be improved.

The governance interventions needed to realize this target should establish clear routes in the complex agenda of the city, partnering with the right authorities and delivering solutions in the right fields. To do this, the governance policy should strengthen the capacity and ownership of relevant entities on the path to climate change, deliver technical excellence in implementing actions and establish a participatory, interdisciplinary and multi-level platform for dialogue to guide this process. We define our interventions under these thematic areas.

## Ownership interventions:

The ownership of actions should be organised in a structured manner so that they are diligently tracked and pushed within the hectic agenda of the city. This structure should be able to organise and bring all the climate related actors together, for establishing this structure IMM planning to reorganise a structure called the Istanbul Climate Platform (ICP). ICP should include all relevant actors including IMM, relevant ministries, district municipalities, universities, professional chambers, NGOs, private sectors etc.

## Istanbul Climate Platform:

On 5 November 2021, IMM announced the Climate Vision and the Climate Change Action Plan for Istanbul. The plan, which constitutes Istanbul's roadmap for the combat against the climate crisis, underlines once more the goal of becoming a carbon neutral and climate resilient city by 2050. In this announcement, it has been pointed out, that a "Climate Platform" has been established under the roof of the Vision 2050 Office which is part of the IPA. Establishment of this platform was served as a compass for all the steps to be taken in line with the goals. Climate Platform is a guarantor for the processes' sustainability, monitorability and success.

## The purpose of the Istanbul Climate Platform (ICP):

Develop, in an exchange of ideas, proposals that strengthen the combat against the climate crisis in the world, in Türkiye but first of all in Istanbul.
Contribute to the development of proposals on how to implement the combat against the climate crisis in Istanbul.
Monitor in a transparent and participative way the climate crisis-related activities of the IMM and all relevant institutions.
Support effective defensive processes in the combat against the climate crisis on a local, national and global level.
Ensure transparent generation and sharing of information on the combat against climate crisis.
Ensure that the young generation and vulnerable communities are heard in the combat against climate crisis.
Ensure that the discussion about climate change is put on the agenda of society, and thus to contribute to awareness building on climate change and practical measures.

Different actors who share concerns about the climate crisis as their common denominator communicate on the platform in a transparent and equal fashion. The platform was provided a common ground for
#

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

online face-to-face meetings, workshops and events that promote common understanding, cooperation and project development.

The IPA Vision 2050 Office managed the platform's secretariat. The ICP was comprised 5 different working groups. Their areas of expertise were:

Emission reduction
Climate monitoring and transparency
Training, awareness and citizen participation
Economy, finance and green transition
Climate adaptation and climate justice

ICP was included activists from different sectors who work on various fields related to the climate crisis. The Climate Change Directorate, a section of IMM's Environmental Protection and Development Department, was a natural member of the platform and acted as intermediary between the sectors. The platform's correspondence address is: iklimplatformu@ipa.lstanbul 3. This platform will be reorganised and adapted to CCC by the Climate Change Directorate.

![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)
Figure 11: First Meeting of the Istanbul Climate Platform with 120 Participants on  $19^{\text{th}}$  of February, 2022

The aim of the reorganized ICP shall be as follows:
Collecting information about the city
Conducting demand, need and impact analysis
Creating a future vision by developing policy recommendations
To ensure inter-institutional coordination
To engage with universities and NGOs
To ensure public participation and bring decision makers together through workshops, organizing events etc.

IMM already has an action that is implemented to define climate responsibles in its units and subsidiaries. The climate responsibles will be the main actors within IMM and will own the climate

neutrality goal in their subject areas, facilitating the Climate Change Directorate of the Department of Environmental Protection and Control within IMM to monitor all studies on a regular basis.

This structure will be strengthened with the ICP and provided with capacity building workshops, trainings on the CCC actions and new duties assigned to implement the CCC. Meanwhile, knowledge transfer among the climate responsibles and monitoring and evaluation of their efforts will be carried through regular collateral meetings. This will enable the climate responsible community to seek support where their capacity falls short of the ambitious goals presented in this CCC, where additional champions may join the team if needed and peer support can be found among champions.

Additionally, channels of dialogue will be established between the ICP and the many universities of Istanbul. There is a wealth of student organisations in the areas of urbanism, public policy and urban life related concepts, and climate. Assigning direct contacts for these organisations to reach out and organise joint events and dialogue opportunities shall enable more efficient participatory processes from the young population of the city.

It is also important to note that existing climate responsibles are assigned with the units and subsidiaries of IMM. Any actions within the CCC that need to be followed up by external actors will be assigned to specific roles within them, who will be invited to collaborate within the ICP. The same approach shall be utilized to create open discussions and invitations to involve citizens. Having climate responsibles as competent facilitators of dialogue regarding their sectors will help build a shared understanding and buy-in of the climate agenda and its co-benefits.

The Climate Platform, which will be reactivated under the leadership of the Climate Change Branch Directorate throughout Istanbul, will be a multi-layered and collaborative structure aiming to ensure effective strategic decision-making and implementation by ensuring broad stakeholder participation. This model will consist of three main components covering processes such as strategy formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. First, the Steering Committee will serve as the highest decision-making body of the platform and will be responsible for setting strategic objectives, approving annual action plans and ensuring coordination between stakeholders. The committee will include representatives of IBB, district municipalities, relevant public institutions, the private sector, civil society organizations, academia, neighbourhood representatives and international organizations. This structure will shape the long-term vision of the platform and oversee the effective use of resources. Working Groups, the second component, will focus on thematic areas such as energy, transportation, building and urban planning, nature-based solutions and climate justice, and will develop concrete projects for the actions in the climate city agreement and play an active role in the implementation of these projects. Each group will be composed of representatives who are experts in their field and will ensure that the projects are implemented both technically and operationally. The third component, the Secretariat, will ensure the day-to-day functioning of the platform and act as a bridge between the Steering Committee and the Working Groups, managing information flow and coordination. The Secretariat will also manage the platform's digital systems, ensuring the collection and analysis of data and reporting regularly on all activities. Alongside these structures, an Audit and Evaluation Mechanism will be established to transparently assess the progress of the platform. This mechanism, which will be composed of independent auditors and experts, will annually evaluate the performance of the platform, the progress of the climate city agreement and the compliance of projects with the targets, and present the results to both the Steering Committee and the public. Finally, it will develop a Citizen Engagement and Feedback Mechanism to ensure the active participation of citizens in the platform. Citizens will be able to provide feedback through the digital platform, neighbourhood representatives and mobile applications, as well as share their views and suggestions through face-to-face meetings and workshops. Thus, all processes of the Climate Platform will be transparent and managed in a sustainable manner by taking into account the suggestions of the public. This governance model will strengthen Istanbul's fight against climate change and ensure the successful implementation of sustainable projects in cooperation with stakeholders.

# Technical coordination and implementation interventions

The accelerated ambition of this report covers Istanbul's ongoing climate actions calls for technical excellence. It is important to identify governance bottlenecks that will enable the technical coordination and implementation of actions that require the cooperation of authorities with specific duties regarding infrastructure and services.

The following key intervention is to utilize the ICP to bring together IMM subsidiaries with a focus on climate efforts. IETT, ISFALT, ISKI, ISTAC, IHE, ISTON, Metro Istanbul are assigned with tasks within the SECAP. Capacity building within these entities to realize their actions might be one of the key factors.

# Platforms of dialogue

To enhance governance through peer dialogue, we propose to push climate specific agenda through inter-municipality institutions IMM is part of. These are mainly the Türkiye Municipalities Union and Marmara Municipalities Union (MMU).

MMU is the first and the largest regional local government association in Türkiye with 192 members from the Marmara Region. MMU's key role is the formation of a culture of agreement and collaboration among mayors and council members elected from different political parties, the development of coordination and cooperation between municipalities, increasing the authority and resources of municipalities, and representing municipalities at the international arena.

MMU has a Sustainability and Climate Change Centre (SCC) that provides guidance and support to members and conducts studies regarding sustainability and climate change. Its core fields are transportation, energy and buildings, land use and biodiversity, water and wastewater, waste, agriculture and food. It also considers the relationship to governance, finance and digitalization. Istanbul may leverage this existing structure to create channels of dialogue, experience and knowledge transfer.

Furthermore, dialogue with civil society, and citizens directly, are at the core of participatory approaches. These routes exist in the individual networks and processes of institutions mentioned in this document, such as MMU that organizes panel discussions and participatory events or IMM that has citizen councils. However, the CCC will add specific routes to this including the ICP cooperation with universities.

Figure 12: Internal and External Stakeholder Workshop on Istanbul Climate City Contract Works

The workshop started with a presentation includes the previous work of IMM on climate change, and explanations and outputs of Climate City Contract studies. In discussions, participants raised that they find all intervention areas very significant and transformations in the energy and buildings sectors as urgent. They exemplified works held by their own institutions.

Finally, a survey was shared with participants and displayed to be explained to participants. With the survey, participants were asked:

Their institution
The sectors they find Istanbul to be strong at on the path to carbon neutrality
The sectors they find to be challenging for Istanbul on the path to carbon neutrality
Top 5 most applicable actions for Istanbul from their point of view out of 15 priority mitigation actions presented
Comments

participants responded to the survey. Within comments, participants particularly pointed at the necessity of collaborations among institutions and other local governments. Some participants reflected

Figure 13: Distribution of Survey Participants based on Institution Type

The survey results, as shown in below figure, indicate that the transport sector is perceived by respondents as the area where Istanbul holds the greatest potential for achieving its carbon neutrality goals. This suggests a strong belief in the city's capacity to implement effective sustainable transportation solutions. While energy, buildings, waste, and water sectors are also recognized as crucial components of a comprehensive strategy, transport emerges as the sector where respondents see the most promising opportunities for Istanbul to make significant strides towards a carbon-neutral future.

The results below, participants perceive the "Buildings" sector as the most challenging for Istanbul to achieve carbon neutrality. This perception stems from the difficulties associated with transforming the existing building stock and implementing energy-efficient practices in new constructions. The "Transport" sector follows closely as a major challenge, reflecting the complexities of managing traffic congestion and promoting sustainable mobility in a densely populated city. "Waste" and "Water and Wastewater" also received notable percentages, indicating perceived challenges in those areas. Interestingly, the "Energy" industry was resulted as less difficult, probably due to confidence in ongoing efforts or a perception of fewer challenges than other sectors. Overall, the survey highlights that while there is optimism in certain areas, significant hurdles are anticipated in the building and transport sectors.

Which sector do you think is the most challenging to achieve the goal of becoming a carbon neutral and smart city?
Figure 15: Challenging Sectors

The responses to the questionnaire show a clear preference among participants for activities connected to energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption as the most relevant for Istanbul's carbon neutrality. The top-ranked actions primarily focus on enhancing energy efficiency in buildings and promoting renewable energy generation.

Also, the electrification of public transport and landfill gas capture for energy generation also garnered significant support, highlighting a focus on sustainable transportation and waste management practices.

Actions related to water management and waste reduction, while still considered important, received comparatively lower rankings. This suggests that participants may perceive certain challenges or complexities in implementing these measures effectively.

In addition to CCC-specific stakeholder engagement activities, we also have other institutional practices to engage citizens in decision-making processes. For example, the Istanbul Senin application offers surveys to gather the public's views on various city-related issues. These surveys collect citizens' opinions on issues such as climate change, energy efficiency and sustainability, and allow the city government to use this information in policy development processes. 2024-2029 Strategic Plan was prepared with citizen participation through the application. In addition to the application, IMM gives citizens a direct say in how a portion of the city budget is spent through participatory budgeting practices. In 2023, selected projects include the conversion of the propulsion systems of buses with outdated internal combustion engines to electric motors and the Istanbul Prepares for Climate Change Training Program. Another platform where citizens participate in the processes is the City Councils. These advisory bodies operate at the local level and are platforms where various community representatives and civil society organizations come together. City councils make recommendations on social, economic and environmental problems in the city and contribute to decision-making processes. The Council's working area groups include the Environment Group and the Climate Crisis working group.

Interventions based on social innovation are crucial for developing creative solutions for the complex problems that cities currently confront. Through the development of more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable solutions, these initiatives aim to raise the standard of living for communities. Such interventions in urban areas typically involve collaborations between the public and private sectors, with the aim of transforming the planning and management of cities.

The main social innovation projects in Istanbul will be covered in this section, with special attention paid to the contributions made to the city's improvement by the Istanbul Climate Platform and the Istanbul Planning Agency.

## Istanbul Planning Agency (IPA)

IPA has prepared the Istanbul Vision 2050 Strategy Document with a holistic strategic approach to the long-term and multi-dimensional development dynamics of the city. It defines the basic objectives to be achieved by 2050 in many areas.

This document presents a roadmap that contains concrete projects and practical applications and defines both the risks that may lie ahead in the foreseeable future but also the potentials. In the future the world, Türkiye and Istanbul will face five basic challenges which may from time to time turn into crises. The below actions will be taken to counter those challenges:

The environment and ecology,
The urban built environment, infrastructure and transport,
Social welfare and justice,
Democracy and governance, and finally
The economy and development.

In line with the objectives and goals of the strategy document, visionary, holistic and concrete actions will be taken to counter those challenges.

Beyond IPA's formal efforts and participatory processes, social engagement for innovative processes will be an evolving concept. This will grow particularly via applications mentioned in the following document. Applications are a modern, direct and convenient way to engage with citizens and these tools exist within IMM, already reaching their target groups. Their iterations will be developed to cover climate related specifics in their fields.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

The Istanbul Climate City Contract Action Plan marks a significant step forward in the city's journey towards climate neutrality. By building upon existing plans and strategies, fostering collaboration across sectors, and prioritizing transformative actions, Istanbul is laying the groundwork for a sustainable and resilient future.

However, the path to 2030 climate neutrality is not without its challenges. The ambitious targets necessitate ongoing efforts to overcome systemic barriers, secure adequate financing, and engage all stakeholders in the transition.

In the coming years, Istanbul will focus on refining and implementing the actions outlined in this Action Plan. This will involve:

Detailed Implementation Plans: Developing comprehensive implementation plans for each priority action, specifying timelines, responsibilities, and resource requirements.
Monitoring and Evaluation: Establishing robust monitoring and evaluation systems to track progress, measure impact, and identify areas for improvement.
Stakeholder Engagement: Continuing to foster collaboration and dialogue with all stakeholders, ensuring their active participation in the implementation process.
Capacity Building: Strengthening the technical and institutional capacity of relevant departments and agencies to effectively implement climate actions.
Financing: Securing adequate financing from diverse sources, including public and private investments, to support the implementation of the Action Plan.
Innovation: Encouraging innovation and experimentation to identify and scale up new solutions for climate neutrality.

IMM is currently preparing Climate Monitoring Reports on a regular basis. These reports will form the basis for reviewing and updating the measures and actions to be taken against the impacts of climate change identified in action plans such as CAP, SECAP and GCAP, including the CCC study in the future. Therefore, Istanbul is committed to regularly updating and refining its Climate City Contract Action Plan, incorporating lessons learned and adapting to evolving circumstances. The city recognizes that the transition to climate neutrality is an ongoing process, requiring continuous effort and collaboration.

In the coming period, we plan to reach out to citizens through elected neighbourhood representatives (Mukhtar). In cooperation with the IMM Department of Mukhtar Affairs, we will organize surveys to provide regular feedback on climate actions and sustainability efforts to neighbourhood residents through neighbourhood mukhtars and Istanbul is Yours (Istanbul Senin) Application. Climate Change Trainings will be given to Climate volunteers to be determined from 961 neighbourhoods in Istanbul. Three people to be selected from these climate volunteers will be included in the Climate Platform to be established.

Through its unwavering dedication to climate action, Istanbul aims to inspire other cities and contribute to a global movement towards a sustainable and equitable future.

# 1 Introduction

With a population exceeding 16 million, Istanbul is not only Türkiye's largest city but also the country's economic powerhouse. The city contributes approximately 30% to the nation's GDP and is a leader in sectors such as information, finance, and professional services, while also serving as a major international trade hub. Its diverse economy encompasses various industries including textiles, metal production, machinery, and more, fostering innovation through organized industrial zones and technology development centres. The service sector is the primary employer in Istanbul, followed by industry.

# Istanbul has positioned itself as a pioneering model for being a green, just and creative city.

Recognized as a global city due to its advantageous geographic position, strong economy, and diverse cultural heritage, Istanbul nonetheless faces challenges related to rapid population growth and environmental issues, which require focused attention for sustainable development. The city is already experiencing the impacts of climate change, with rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and the risk of sea-level rise. These changes present significant threats to Istanbul's infrastructure, the well-being of its residents, and its overall sustainability.

The city's size and population density also necessitate comprehensive planning to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the transportation sector. To this end, the city has been working to strengthen public transport, expand metro lines, and increase the use of electric vehicles, as outlined in strategic plans like the Istanbul Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), and its Phase 2 Implementation Plan. In fact, in line with this commitment to sustainable transport, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) is currently building 10 new metro lines simultaneously, setting a global record for metro line construction.

Recognizing the urgency of the climate crisis, the IMM has been actively developing robust strategies and policies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change. This includes the creation of a Climate Action Plan aligned with C40 and Paris Agreement goals. Energy efficiency is a critical component of these efforts, as the city seeks to reduce both energy consumption and carbon emissions. Initiatives include retrofitting existing buildings to improve energy efficiency, designing new buildings to meet stringent energy standards, and increasing the use of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and biomass. The city's Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) further details these measures.

Istanbul is also taking significant steps in waste management, recognizing the challenge of sustainably managing the increasing amount of waste generated by its large population and intensive economic activities. In this regard, the collection of waste is under the responsibility of district municipalities, while IMM is responsible for its removal and disposal. IMM is developing waste management and circular economy strategies, such as the Istanbul Waste Management Plan, to address this challenge and contribute to the city's climate neutrality goals, as outlined in strategic documents like the Istanbul Zero Waste Management System Plan and the Provincial Environmental Status Report. The use of waste for biogas and compost production is an important step towards adopting circular economy principles in waste management, contributing both to waste reduction and renewable energy production.

IMM is a voluntary member of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM), which is dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering resilient cities. Within this framework, the first Istanbul Climate Change Action Plan was published in 2018, establishing reduction targets of 33% by 2030 and 35% by 2050.

Recognizing the unique circumstances of Türkiye and Istanbul, IMM, with contributions from thousands of individuals, developed the Istanbul Vision 2050 Strategy Document. This document addresses the
ISTANBUL METROPOLITAN MUNICIPALITY

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

city's economic, ecological, social, and spatial challenges, safeguards its distinctive values, defines its long-term global role by leveraging its local potential and historical legacy, and allocates resources in alignment with citizen-determined priorities. The document focuses on five key crisis areas: Governance and Democracy, Economy and Development, Ecology and Environment, Urban Built Environment, Transport and Infrastructure, and Public Welfare and Justice. To counteract these challenges, the document outlines goals and targets under seven themes, ensuring İstanbul achieves its rightful place by 2050 and guarantees social justice and prosperity for all its residents. These themes encompass: Protecting the Environment and Adapting to a Changing Climate, Effective and Inclusive Mobility, Integrated and Intelligent Infrastructure Systems, Vibrant and Responsive Places Providing Good Living, Transformative and Resilient Economy, Accessible and Equitable Urban Amenities for All, and an Equal and Free Society.

Furthermore, IMM holds the distinction of being the first and sole C40 member municipality in Türkiye. Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, during the C40 Mayors Summit in Copenhagen in October 2019, signed the Deadline 2020 Commitment, pledging to transform İstanbul into a carbon-neutral and resilient city by 2050. This new target prompted the need to revise the 2018 Climate Change Action Plan, leading to the publication of the updated İstanbul Climate Action Plan (CAP) in 2021.

The CAP report is a comprehensive roadmap outlining the city's strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance energy efficiency, invest in renewable energy sources, and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. This plan represents a significant milestone in İstanbul's journey towards achieving climate neutrality and resilience. It encompasses a wide range of sectors and strategies to address the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change, reflecting the city's determination to create a sustainable and resilient future for its residents. The EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission will serve as a catalyst for İstanbul to expand and accelerate its existing climate action, providing technical assistance, and expertise for high-cost initiatives such as large infrastructure projects, renewable energy investments, and the integration of smart city technologies.

In May 2021, İstanbul also joined the EBRD's Green Cities Programme, initiating the İstanbul Green City Action Plan (GCAP) studies in May 2023. The GCAP aims to identify measures to address the impacts of climate change and other environmental challenges, thereby strengthening İstanbul's resilience. The city's location in a seismically active region, with its inherent earthquake risk, further underscores the importance of the GCAP. The plan's implementation will enable the construction of more robust infrastructure and the development of smarter urban planning strategies, mitigating potential damage. The GCAP is scheduled for publication at the end of 2024, translating the city's commitments and goals into concrete actions.

IMM believes that public participation and awareness are crucial to achieving İstanbul's sustainability and climate resilience goals. Through participatory processes like the Participatory Budget Project, citizens are well informed and actively involved in shaping the city's future, which is implemented by IMM. As part of this project, the "İstanbul is Preparing for Climate Change" training programme was implemented in 2023. The projects developed under the Mission will also provide opportunities to increase public participation and raise awareness of climate change, further strengthening public support for climate neutrality goals.

As İstanbul, to make our intentions clearer on this issue, we are presenting our dedication to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. In line with this goal, we plan to rapidly reduce the city's energy consumption and carbon emissions. We believe that the mission can act as a catalyst for İstanbul to develop innovative technologies and solutions in the field of urban sustainability. This will enable us to adopt new approaches in areas such as smart city applications, energy efficiency technologies, water management systems, and waste management. The networks and cooperation opportunities provided by the Mission will allow for faster and more effective implementation of such technologies.

Istanbul is also committed to ensuring its resilience to the risks posed by climate change. In this context, the city continues to increase its infrastructure investments to mitigate the impact of floods, heat waves, and other extreme weather events. The development of the Drinking Water and Wastewater Master Plan 2023-2053 is a testament to this commitment.

As part of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality applied to the NetZeroCities Pilot Cities Programme, launched to help the city achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 and to test innovative approaches, with the “Green and Carbon Neutral Building Transition Guide – İstanbul Model (Build4GreenIST)” project and became the first pilot city from Türkiye to be selected.

Istanbul applied to the Mission’s call for pilot cities with the project “Green and Carbon Neutral Building Transition Guide – İstanbul Model (Build4GreenIST)” and was selected as the first pilot city from Türkiye. The motivating point of this highly inspiring project is to address the city's main problems, earthquake risk and climate crisis, together. The project will provide a guide for this transformation towards a green and carbon neutral building concept that is resistant to climate change; while carrying out the inevitable urban transformation works in the city where earthquake risk and old buildings are too many. The aim is to highlight the positive impact that the addition of climate-friendly practices to the urban transformation works in the city will have in terms of climate change and renewable/efficient energy use during the transformation process, which is very necessary for the city. The studies will be carried out using a methodology that involves almost all the city's stakeholders in the field of building energy. The guide, which will be produced at the end of the project, is intended to provide effective benefits and awareness for the city's decarbonisation efforts.

The Build4GreenIST project will provide a guide to ensure that buildings renovated as part of urban regeneration are green and carbon neutral. It will also monitor energy consumption in buildings in a pilot area through sensors and encourage behavioural change of citizens towards energy efficiency. A mobile application called GreenIST is being developed for this purpose. In addition, the trainings and conferences organised under the project for a wide range of stakeholders such as citizens, practitioners, local government representatives are also contributing significantly to inclusive awareness efforts. The project will also include the development of business and finance models to bring a holistic approach to this opportunity for change.

Through these comprehensive efforts and the support of the EU Mission, Istanbul is dedicated to achieving its ambitious climate neutrality goal by 2030 and creating a more sustainable and resilient future for its residents and the world.

# 2 Goal: Climate Neutrality by 2030

IMM is committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2030, aligning with the ambitious targets set forth in the EU Mission. As a local government, IMM recognizes its responsibility to lead by example and is prioritizing efforts to accelerate climate neutrality within its municipal buildings and operations, as outlined in its Mission Expression of Interest. The city also aims to leverage its influence to mobilize key stakeholders and expedite the implementation of actions identified in the İstanbul Climate Action Plan, fostering a collaborative approach to achieving city-wide climate neutrality.

We – as IMM, have demonstrated our commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 in the CAP report published in 2021. In line with this commitment, we set an interim target of 52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to the base year 2019 in CAP. In this study, we have increased this target even further and increased our 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target to 80% compared to the base year 2019.

İstanbul's 2030 climate neutrality target is comprehensive, encompassing all sectors within its city-wide boundary. The city is committed to exploring all possible avenues to address challenges and will continue to refine its strategies as part of its ongoing commitment to climate action.

İstanbul's pursuit of climate neutrality is further supported by its proactive development of strategies, action plans, and policies aimed at ensuring a sustainable and climate-resilient future. As mentioned before, key initiatives include the İstanbul Climate Change Action Plan prepared in accordance with the C40 net zero target by 2050, the İstanbul Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), the İstanbul SUMP: Phase 2 Implementation Plan, and the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), and İstanbul Waste Management Plan. These plans outline concrete steps the city is taking to reduce carbon emissions, improve energy efficiency, promote sustainable transportation, and enhance waste management practices. Additionally, İstanbul Green City Action Plan is being developed and will be published at the end of the year. This plan outlines the environmental challenges proposes solutions to enhance resilience and adaptation to climate change through targeted investment projects and policy initiatives.

In addition, the commitment to the EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission reflects İstanbul's recognition of the urgent need to address climate change and its pioneering mission to serve as a model for other cities in Türkiye and beyond. By prioritizing climate action within its own sphere of influence and actively engaging with stakeholders across various sectors, İstanbul aims to make significant strides towards a sustainable and climate-resilient future. The city's dedication to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable practices will not only benefit its residents but also contribute to global efforts to combat climate change.

Through these comprehensive efforts and the support of the EU Mission, İstanbul is dedicated to achieving its ambitious climate neutrality goal by 2030 and creating a more sustainable and resilient future for its residents and the world. The city also actively participates in other communities that support the Cities Mission, such as the EU Adaptation Mission and the Urban Transition Mission (UTM), further demonstrating its commitment to a holistic approach to sustainability and climate action.

# 3 Strategic Priorities

In line with the European Union's Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, İstanbul is dedicated to achieving climate neutrality by 2030. The city acknowledges the urgent need to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and foster a sustainable urban environment that benefits both present and future generations. To realize this ambitious goal, we – as İstanbul City- outlined five strategic priorities that will serve as the foundation for our efforts to combat climate change and enhance resilience as follows:

Clean Transportation: This priority focuses on significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. It involves promoting sustainable modes of transport, such as public transport, cycling, and walking, and transitioning to cleaner vehicle technologies, including electric buses and cars. The city aims to create a more efficient, accessible, and environmentally friendly transportation system that reduces traffic congestion, improves air quality, and enhances the overall quality of life for its residents. In that sense, IMM prepared Türkiye's first Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan. This plan is shaped around three themes and "Transition to Low Carbon" theme of SUMP is directly related with carbon neutrality targets. Moreover, IMM is currently conducting the second phase SUMP which focuses on the development of an activity-based city-wide transport model and preparation of design projects.

Renewable Energy Transition: This priority centres on shifting İstanbul's energy supply towards renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and biomass. It includes expanding renewable energy capacity, promoting energy efficiency measures, and developing district heating and cooling systems powered by renewable sources such as low temperature geothermal energy. The goal is to reduce the city's reliance on fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and create a more sustainable and resilient energy system.

Enhancing Building Efficiency: This priority focuses on improving the energy performance of İstanbul's building stock, both existing and new. It encompasses retrofitting existing buildings with energy-efficient technologies, establishing and enforcing stringent energy efficiency standards for new construction projects, and promoting the use of renewable energy sources in buildings. By enhancing building efficiency, İstanbul aims to significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector.

Circular Economy and Sustainable Consumption: This priority emphasizes the importance of transitioning to a circular economy model that minimizes waste and maximizes resource efficiency. It involves promoting waste reduction, recycling, and the adoption of circular economy principles across various sectors, including waste management, production, and consumption. By embracing a circular economy approach, İstanbul aims to reduce its environmental impact, conserve resources, and create a more sustainable and resilient city.

Strategic Water Management: Recognizing the critical importance of water resources in a climate-resilient future, İstanbul prioritizes strategic water management. This encompasses enhancing water efficiency, promoting sustainable water use practices, and investing in resilient water infrastructure. The city is committed to ensuring a secure and sustainable water supply for its residents while safeguarding against the potential impacts of climate change, such as droughts and floods. The recently completed İstanbul Water Master Plan provides a comprehensive framework for achieving these objectives through integrated water resource management and innovative solutions.

These 5 priority strategies are addressed together in the action plans developed by IMM such as CAP, SECAP, SUMP, etc. and in city-wide activities. These priority strategies complement each other and form the fundamental milestones towards IMM's goals.

İstanbul is also actively demonstrating its commitment to climate action through tangible initiatives that go beyond policy and planning. The city has achieved significant milestones, such as manufacturing its own tram for the first time, introducing electric/hybrid-powered sea taxis, and generating energy from waste to meet household needs. These projects, detailed on the IMM website¹, exemplify İstanbul's dedication to innovation and sustainable practices across various sectors. They underscore the city's proactive approach to addressing climate challenges and its determination to lead by example in the transition towards a greener future.

# 4 Process and Principles

İstanbul's commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2030 is guided by a robust framework of principles and a dynamic, iterative process that fosters collaboration, innovation, and accountability.

# 4.1 Systemic Work Process

Our systemic work process towards climate neutrality is anchored in a holistic approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of urban systems. We will adopt a "nexus approach", integrating climate action across key sectors such as energy-buildings, transport, water-wastewater, and waste management as well as information technologies. This approach will ensure that interventions in one sector complement and reinforce efforts in others, maximizing the overall impact of climate action. Moreover, these climate actions will have several co-benefits such as improved air quality, public health, new green and just recovery jobs created, increased accessibility, etc.

To facilitate this approach, İstanbul aims to establish a platform which can be named as İstanbul Climate Platform (ICP), comprising representatives from relevant municipal departments, agencies, and external stakeholders such as central government provincial directorates, chamber of industry, chamber of commerce, organised industrial zones, universities, and NGOs.

This platform was established in 2021 and it consisted mostly of academics. However, with IMM's new target, the Platform will be reorganized and serve as a central platform for coordinating climate action, aligning policies and programs, and monitoring progress toward the city's climate goals.

The systemic work process will also involve the development of detailed action plans for each priority sector. These plans will outline specific targets, timelines, and responsibilities, ensuring a clear roadmap for implementation. The plans will be regularly reviewed and updated based on the latest scientific evidence, technological advancements, and stakeholder input, ensuring a dynamic and adaptive approach to climate action.

# 4.2 Monitoring and Updating the CCC

We are committed to transparently monitoring and reporting on our progress towards climate neutrality. The city will establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system that tracks key indicators related to greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, renewable energy generation, and other relevant metrics.

We will continue to publish annually and enable continuous improvement. Climate Monitoring Reports that provide a detailed assessment of the city's performance against its climate targets. These reports are publicly available, allowing for transparency and accountability. Furthermore, these reports will also include an analysis of lessons learned and challenges encountered, informing future decision-making.

We have already taken the initiative to designate Climate Responsible within various IMM units and subsidiaries. These responsibles will be responsible for driving the climate neutrality goal within their respective areas and will facilitate regular monitoring of all related studies by the IMM Directorate of Climate Change. In addition, to facilitate efficient communication and streamlined coordination throughout the execution of the Cities Mission activities, an email group comprising the Heads of the relevant internal Departments/Directorates within IMM has been established.

To further enhance the Climate Responsibles, IMM planning to involve this structure in the reorganized İstanbul Climate Platform (the ICP). This platform will be working to provide capacity-building workshops, training on Climate City Contract (CCC) actions, and assign new responsibilities to ensure effective implementation of the CCC. The Climate Responsibles community will benefit from knowledge

transfer and regular meetings for monitoring and evaluation, allowing them to seek support when needed and foster peer-to-peer collaboration.

The platform is established to create the vision of İstanbul 2050 with a common mind. It is a platform that brings together citizens, NGOs, academics, sector representatives to communicate and contribute on climate issue. The main purpose of the platform is to give voice to people from different people groups and seek solutions on issues like emission reduction, climate monitoring, awareness, green transformation, adaptation and climate justice etc. People meet regularly physically or through social platforms (zoom etc) to exchange ideas and voice their opinions.

ICP will play an important role in overseeing the monitoring and evaluation process. The council will regularly review the data and analysis, identify areas for improvement, and recommend adjustments to the Climate City Contract as needed. This iterative process will ensure that the CCC remains a living document that adapts to the evolving needs and challenges of the city. The council will also facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among stakeholders, fostering a collective effort to achieve İstanbul's climate goals.

While the existing climate responsibles are assigned within IMM, the ICP will extend its reach to external actors. Actions within the CCC that require follow-up from external entities will be assigned to specific individuals within those organizations, who will be invited to collaborate within the ICP. This collaborative approach will also be used to engage citizens in open discussions, with climate responsible acting as facilitators to build a shared understanding and support for the climate agenda and its benefits.

In addition to the annual Climate Monitoring Report, through our Climate Change Directorate, data related to greenhouse gas inventory and mitigation and adaptation efforts carried out by İstanbul are regularly submitted each year to CDP. These voluntary annual reporting efforts demonstrate the city's commitment to transparency and its willingness to benchmark its performance against global standards. The feedback and insights gained from these initiatives, along with the preparation of monitoring reports, will further inform İstanbul's climate strategies and actions, ensuring that the city remains at the forefront of the global fight against climate change. These efforts also contribute significantly to the city's risk management and strategy development by enabling the identification and assessment of climate-related risks and the formulation of effective adaptation strategies. By comparing emissions data year on year, İstanbul can analyse climate risks and develop long-term sustainability and adaptation strategies, ensuring the city's resilience in the face of climate change.

## 4.3 Guiding Principles

As emphasized by our Mayor, the overarching objective of the IMM is to collaboratively plan and create an İstanbul that is liveable, respectful of nature, protective of its cultural heritage, environmentally harmonious, equipped with comprehensive infrastructure, and where decisions about its future are made through collaboration.

In line with this, "Green, Just, and Creative İstanbul" serves as our fundamental institutional vision.

İstanbul's climate action is guided by a set of core principles that inform its decision-making and actions:

Equity and Social Inclusion: İstanbul recognizes that climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable communities. The city is committed to ensuring that its climate actions are equitable and inclusive, prioritizing the needs of marginalized groups and promoting social justice. For this reason, IMM chooses pilot areas where vulnerable groups live in particular in its projects and studies. For example, the Bayrampaşa district, where mostly immigrants and low-income people live, was chosen for the "Green and Carbon Neutral Building Transition Guide-İstanbul Model (Build4GreenIST)" Project, and the Kadıköy district, where people from many ethnic backgrounds

and religions live and which is a transportation hub, was chosen for the Urban Planning and design ready for 2030 (UP2030) Project.

Scientifically Informed Decision-Making: İstanbul's climate policies and actions are based on the best available scientific evidence. The city is engaged with experts and researchers to ensure that its decisions are informed by the latest scientific understanding of climate change and its impacts. CAP, SECAP, SUMP, etc, reports were prepared with this approach.

Collaboration and Partnership: İstanbul believes that achieving climate neutrality requires collaboration across all sectors of society. The city actively engages with businesses, civil society organizations, academic institutions, and other stakeholders to develop and implement effective climate solutions. Most of the examples are mentioned in the Action Plan of the İstanbul CCC.

Local Ownership and Empowerment: İstanbul recognizes the importance of local ownership and empowerment in driving climate action. The city empowers local communities to participate in decision-making processes, implement climate solutions, and benefit from the transition to a climate-neutral future.

By adhering to these principles and adopting a systemic and iterative approach, İstanbul is confident in its ability to achieve its ambitious climate neutrality goal by 2030 and create a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable city for all.
