KEY PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS

## ANNEX I

CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR THE CITY OF VITORIA-GASTEIZ

## INTRODUCTION

The City Council of Vitoria-Gasteiz (AVG) has been working on sustainability for several decades, addressing various territorial, environmental, economic and social challenges. Vitoria-Gasteiz's current Urban Agenda 2030 has determined that one of its strategic challenges is to become a green, climate neutral, resilient and self-sufficient city. To achieve this, the city must carry out a process of energy and circular transition, separating economic growth from the consumption of energy and other raw materials, promoting energy saving, energy efficiency and the use of renewable and non-polluting resources. This transformation must be accompanied by other transitions in the technological, digital, regulatory and ecological fields, as well as innovation processes in economic and social structures. The city of Vitoria-Gasteiz is on its way to meeting these challenges.

Since it undertook its sustainability roadmap more than three decades ago, the city has made constant and consistent progress, setting goals through policies, plans and local strategies to promote sustainability and climate action in the city. Some of these include approving the Local Agenda 21 for Vitoria-Gasteiz (1998), joining the Covenant of Mayors (2008 and ratified in 2020) and awards such as the European Green Capital in 2012 or the Global Green City Award in 2019.

Its more specific energy sustainability policies and climate strategies started to emerge in 2006 when more specific targets were set to promote the city's energy transition and climate action. One step towards achieving these goals was the first Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), approved in 2010 and stemming from joining the Covenant of Mayors initiative earlier, which led to a reduction of GHG emissions in the city. This plan, called the Vitoria-Gasteiz Plan to Combat Climate Change (2010-2020), established the commitment to reduce GHG emissions from a variety of sectors by 25.7% in 2020 compared to 2006 emissions. In the end, this reduction totalled 31.4%, which means a reduction of more than 1 tonne of equivalent CO₂ per inhabitant per year.

More recently, following a renewal of commitments with the Covenant of Mayors initiative, a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) has been developed and approved, with a time frame of 2030. This plan aims to facilitate the energy and climate transition in Vitoria-Gasteiz; in other words, it will help decarbonise the territory, to ensure that citizens enjoy access to safe, sustainable and affordable energy, and strengthen their capacity to adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change.
The SECAP has been developed thanks to participation from various institutional agents, as well as private stakeholders and citizens, both from organisations and individuals, right from the initial stages of its preparation. This involved face-to-face workshops (generation of the energy scenario and vision, contrast and debate of actions, etc.) and web technologies, trying to maximise information dissemination among external and internal agents and obtain their contributions.

This SECAP 2030 will be the starting point of the Vitoria-Gasteiz Climate Action Plan, which aims to accelerate the city's decarbonisation.

This Plan, and Vitoria-Gasteiz's participation in the Mission, also includes an Institutional Declaration of Support for the decarbonisation of the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz within the framework of the European Missions on carbon-neutral and smart cities and adaptation to climate change (2022). This Declaration was supported by all the political groups in the City Council Plenary, demonstrating that political consensus is a pillar on which Vitoria-Gasteiz has worked intensively over the years.

It is important to highlight that the SECAP follows the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), through a process of systemic transformation run by the AVG, which has led it, among other things, to align all its policies with the SDGs, approving a strategic document and an action plan for the Vitoria-Gasteiz Urban Agenda 2030 (AUVG2030). This document also includes an Institutional Declaration of Support for the Vitoria-Gasteiz Urban Agenda 2030 (AU2030VG) - Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 Strategy (2022) supported by all the political groups in the Municipal Plenary.

It is also important to highlight that the SECAP follows Vitoria-Gasteiz's New Urban Development City Plan (UDCP). The strategic objectives on which the basic criteria for the drafting of the UDCP are based, which also match the goals determined for the 17 SDGs and the 2030 Agenda, are as follows: (1) A compact, complex and cohesive city, (2) Promotion and protection of the rural environment and villages, (3) Enhancement of the natural, cultural and landscape heritage, (4) A sustainable and energy efficient territory, (5) Economic balance of the territory, and (6) Vitoria-Gasteiz, by and for everyone (strategic objective which cuts across all of the above).

Objective (4) includes transferring the city's energy and climate sustainability objectives to the territory. During the UDCP review, the "Reimagina" citizen participation process was carried out, in which various activities aimed to introduce people to the document, raising awareness on it (travelling exhibition, explanatory sessions), as well as to debate and gather citizens' opinions (citizen debate forums and thematic workshops) on the contents of the document.

Vitoria-Gasteiz has been actively participating for years in regional, national, European and international networks with the intention of sharing, applying and transferring the

4
experiences and lessons learned, thus extending the city's present and future sustainability and climate neutrality activities.

As mentioned above, the document used as a starting point for developing the city's Climate Action Plan within this Climate City Contract is the SECAP 2030. This Plan has been revised based on the results of the Economic Model carried out by Material Economics, to firstly reveal the existing gaps in the transport, buildings and heating, electricity and waste sectors to achieve climate neutrality in 2030 for the entire city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, and to plan and develop the actions required to achieve this neutrality.

However, not all actions directly reduce GHG emissions. We would also like to work in sectors that the economic model does not mention, such as industry, which accounts for more than 25% of business in our city.

In addition, large industrial companies in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz are already working on their own decarbonisation. For example, Mercedes Benz has 2030 a decarbonisation target for its Vitoria-Gasteiz plant. Michelin plans to decarbonise a part of its factory in the city by 2025. PepsiCo and the Eroski supermarket chain, like Michelin, are using their Vitoria-Gasteiz premises to spearhead decarbonisation of their companies and have declared their intention to be decarbonised by 2030.

On the other hand, the Alava Technology Park, which is home to more than 150 companies in the technology sector, has a decarbonisation plan for 2030. All these issues were discussed at the Conference "Decarbonisation, Industry and City" held in Vitoria-Gasteiz on 7 October 2022.

The City Council will work closely with all these companies to reflect these commitments and their specific actions and projects in the successive iterations of this Climate City Contract.

Nevertheless, we will also work with small and medium-sized enterprises through the Green Deal Community of companies and organisations in the Vitoria-Gasteiz business sector that are working on transition to business models which require fewer natural resources and have a lower climate impact. In all cross-cutting areas or lines of action such as governance, data, finance or social innovation, the necessary alliances and support from platforms such as NetZeroCities and CitiES2030 will be sought to find innovative actions that will help us to strengthen the current Action Plan and to honour the commitments acquired through this Contract.

With regard to the University, the Alava Campus of the University of the Basque Country has plans for decarbonisation in 2030, so the City Council will work closely with them to give them the necessary support and impetus.

However, we also want to remain pioneers in the areas of green infrastructure, mobility,

5
circularity and the agri-food sector, where we are working hard to make steady progress.

Addressing Scope 3 emissions is one of our outstanding issues although this Climate Action Plan already describes some initiatives we are developing in the city.

Finally, we would like to work on all those cross-cutting levers where innovation is key to achieving our objectives, such as governance, regulatory sandboxes, data and social participation. For all of this, the necessary support and assistance will be sought for successive iterations of this Climate Action Plan.

## WORK PROCESS

Vitoria-Gasteiz (VG) is working to become a carbon neutral, resilient, metabolically efficient and biodiverse city by 2030. A city with a vibrant and committed social fabric in a safe, healthy and inclusive environment, embedded in an attractive and prosperous economic system. Numerous environmental awards prove this, such as the Civitas Award (2010), EU Green Capital (2012) and Global Green City Award (UNHabitat, 2019).

VG is strongly committed to climate change. Its first Climate Change Plan (2010-2020) targeted a 25.7% reduction in GHG emissions by 2020 (base year 2006). Current emissions represent a 31.4% reduction, well above the original target. The current SECAP (2021-2030) has set GHG emission reduction targets of 61.5% and 83% (with carbon sinks) by 2030 (base year 2006). Like the previous plan, VG has taken up the challenge of achieving higher reduction levels leading to climate neutrality by 2030. Support, such as from the EU Mission, will help VG reach its target.

This goal is being met through ongoing projects. VG aims to be a flagship city in terms of distributed energy production from renewable sources. Fossil fuels will be eliminated in residential buildings, service sector and municipal buildings. Immediate retrofit programmes will follow up on the success story of the Coronación neighbourhood, where 26 buildings, totalling 524 equivalent dwellings, were retrofitted and a district biomass heating system was installed, reducing energy demand and emissions by 3 GWh/year and 1,000 tCO₂e/year respectively.

In terms of mobility, VG wants to be recognised for its strong commitment to active mobility, a data-driven (decision-making based on data analysis and interpretation) and an electrified public transport system. The share of private car use dropped from 36.5% in 2006 to 29% in 2019. Public transport use increased by 43% and cycling by 211%. Ongoing and future interventions will help to strengthen this shift. Implementation of eBRT (electric Bus Rapid Transport or BEI - Intelligent Electric Bus) in 2022 will save 1,520 tonnes of CO₂e/year. The extension of the tramway by mid-2023 will also lead to a

6
significant reduction in the use of private vehicles. Other interventions include creating a Low Emission Zone in the city centre (2023), installing disincentive systems for private vehicles (charging systems, etc.) (2023), constructing a last-mile distribution centre for cargo bikes (2024) and a commitment to encourage more sustainable mobility to go to work.

VG also wants to position itself as a role model in addressing Scope 3 GHG emissions. The food systems strategy and action plan (2017-2025) and the materials circularity strategy (ongoing) are pioneering in their own right. The City Food Flows of VG assessment (2021) revealed that more than 95% of unprocessed food consumed in the city is imported. The same might be said for all materials. These plans will estimate indirect emissions and implement actions that contribute to decarbonising both systems.

Carbon sinks will also play an important role, and VG is constantly investigating how to optimise them. Currently, the Green Belt absorbs 3,168 tonnes CO₂ₑ/year (i-tree methodology, 2019). The newly built peri-urban park will increase this capacity by 672 t CO₂ₑ/year. VG aims to include carbon sequestration criteria in the design of green and blue infrastructure.

Finally, a note on integration and horizontal aspects. VG aspires to become a city with institutions that exercise powerful leadership and act in an exemplary manner, working together with co-responsible Citizens. A city with a high level of awareness, reinforced by a model of community cooperation to face the challenges posed by energy transition at a local level. All this is happening in a thriving, innovative and competitive economic environment that ensures a collaborative social model where no one is left behind. More than 35 letters of support for this mission were signed by local actors, proving that VG is moving in the right direction.

The SECAP 2030 is the main tool that organises all action on energy transition, mitigation and adaptation to climate change in the city. It is composed of two interrelated action plans: the Integrated Energy Transition Action Plan (PATEI) and the Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan (PAACC).

In the field of energy transition and emission mitigation, the SECAP 2030 sets the following targets for 2030 compared to the base year (2006), referring to the various sectors (residential, services and institutional sectors, internal mobility, and primary sector):

Reduce energy consumption by 29%.
Reduce direct GHG emissions by 61.5%.
Reduce net GHG emissions by 83.1%.

It also establishes specific adaptation goals for Vitoria-Gasteiz, defined according to the
results of the impact chains evaluated in the risk diagnosis carried out for the city as a whole:

Droughts on rural areas: reduce the risk associated with agricultural activities due to the possible effects of climate change by strengthening their adaptive capacity.
River flooding on the urban environment: reduce flooding associated with extreme events and improve the ecological status of water bodies and the sustainable use of this resource.
Pluvial flooding on the urban environment: guaranteeing the territorial and urban functionality of the city by increasing the resilience of drainage infrastructures and sustainable territorial planning.
Heat waves on the health of the population: ensuring thermal comfort and access to comfort zones during extreme temperature episodes.
Extreme winds on urban, rural and population health: improving knowledge on climate change scenarios of extreme winds.

In total, the SECAP 2030 includes 100 actions in 13 strategic areas for energy transition, mitigation and adaptation to climate change in the city.

This Plan has been revised according to the results of the Economic Model carried out by Material Economics, to firstly reveal the existing gaps in the following sectors, transport, buildings and heating, electricity, and waste, to achieve climate neutrality in 2030 for the entire city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, and to plan and develop the necessary actions to achieve this neutrality.

Based on the SECAP 2030 data and the results of the Economic Modelling, conducted by Material Economics for the first iteration in the development framework of this Climate City Contract, six key priorities or strategies have been identified that must be addressed urgently to achieve the goal of climate neutrality:

Integrated regeneration and eco-rehabilitation of the city's neighbourhoods
Generation of energy through renewable sources and promotion of Energy Communities (EC).
Mobility and sustainable transport
Circularity of the local economic system
Green Infrastructure and carbon sinks
Intelligent data-driven management.

Within these 6 key strategies, and in this first iteration, some lines of action have already been implemented or planned in SECAP 2030 which, due to the new climate neutrality goal, must not only be implemented but also accelerated. Other lines will require additional innovative actions and financing models, for which alliances and

8
collaborations will be sought among the various local agents involved, and with agents from other geographic areas. These lines of action should be contrasted, modified and updated throughout successive iterations of this Climate City Contract.

There are also cross-cutting priority elements common to all lines such as:
Governance
Regulation
Funding
Social communication,

requiring a systematic review for successive iterations of this Climate City Contract to be used efficiently as a lever for the desired systemic change.

These strategic lines are detailed below with some specific examples of action areas, which should be accelerated in some cases and in other cases must include new innovative actions.

## (1) Integrated regeneration and eco-rehabilitation of neighbourhoods

The aim is to carry out urban, social and environmental regeneration with the following objectives:
Improve the energy efficiency of residential and tertiary buildings, including publicly-owned buildings.
Improving universal accessibility and sustainable mobility.
Connecting households to a high-speed digital network.
Connect households and commercial premises to a city-wide decarbonised district heating network.
Improve public space with the introduction of green infrastructure (and other actions, e.g. accessibility).
Generate low- or zero-emission urban developments and building sites.

Two pilot projects of the Mission have been launched immediately:
Urban regeneration, eco-rehabilitation and vitalisation of the Zaramaga neighbourhood (AD) of Vitoria-Gasteiz
Ensanche XIX - Entrepreneurial Eco-District

The success of these pilot projects can mean real acceleration for the city's progress towards climate neutrality.

Within the scope of action referring to a decarbonised thermal network for the city as a whole, a process has been initiated to assess technical and economic-financial feasibility, as well as its social acceptance, as a preliminary phase for its subsequent definition and development. Future iterations of this Climate City Contract will specify the final model of this decarbonised network.

9
(2) Generation of energy from renewable sources and promotion of Energy Communities (EC)

This strategic line of work includes the following areas of action:

Public, private and public-private thermal and electrical power generation.
Deployment of renewable energy generation projects in municipal buildings and public spaces, mainly based on photovoltaic solar energy, targeting self-consumption.
Installation of photovoltaic solar energy in residential, tertiary and industrial buildings.
Promoting the creation of Energy Communities in urban and rural areas.
Tackling fuel poverty through developing programmes and support schemes for vulnerable groups and encouraging the use of alternative financing systems (e.g. through energy communities or crowdfunding).

We are currently working on a community energy initiative with citizens to co-create an energy project in the rural area of the municipality to define a renewable thermal energy community that uses local resources (forestry and agricultural waste). Once this project has been consolidated, it will be scalable to other rural areas of the municipality. All of this will be incorporated into the successive iterations of this Climate City Contract.

(3) Mobility and sustainable transport

The aim is to transform and decarbonise the city's mobility system by:

drawing up a new sustainable mobility model which promotes active mobility and an electrified public transport system.
developing the superblocks model and implementing traffic calming zones
extending the pedestrian and cycling networks, and extending the public transport network
reformulating the regulated parking zones
promoting mobility electrification (private and public, passenger and freight)
promoting the use of efficient driving techniques.

Ongoing and future interventions will help to reinforce this change.

Implementation of eBRT (electric Bus Rapid Transit).
Creation of a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) in the city centre (2023)
Installation of deterrent systems for private vehicles (charging systems, etc.) (2023)
Improving urban logistics by building a last-mile centre (2024).
Etc.

(4) Circularity of the local economic system

Circularity of the production system.

The objective is to progressively modify the urban economic-productive system from the currently prevailing linear economic model to a circular model, which keeps materials in circulation indefinitely, obtains the highest possible value before and after disposal, and prioritises the sustainable use of resources through transition to renewable energies, among other possibilities.

Boosting the circular transition of economic activity sectors.
Boosting circular entrepreneurship.
New headquarters for the Basque Circular Hub in Vitoria-Gasteiz

Municipal waste management

The Urban Waste Prevention and Management Plan (2016-2030) encompasses the current situation, and a series of objectives and measures have been planned to prevent waste generation (reduction of more than 15% in weight compared to 2016), prepare for reuse and recycling of waste (reaching at least 60% by weight of total waste), and reduce the waste sent to landfill (below 15%), to substantially improve current ratios and significantly contribute to lowering emissions. Within this framework, a number of projects are already underway:

New bulky waste collection service with a circular economy approach, provided by a third-sector company that collects, sorts, prepares for reuse and markets the collected bulky waste. In addition, a shop has been set up selling decoration, furniture, toys and other reused products at affordable prices, obtained through this service and which have passed quality standards for sale.
The Konpondu Project seeks to promote a change in the current consumption model of citizens with the aim of prolonging the useful life of products through the local repair sector.
Reutilizagune is a service for individuals promoting reuse and second life of appliances and household goods.
Collection of used vegetable oil by containerisation on the public highway.
Selective organic matter collection and composting.

Vitoria-Gasteiz Circularity Strategy 2030

A local Circularity Strategy 2030 and an initial action plan with a time frame of 4 years (2023-2026) are currently being developed. Its planning scope covers materials and waste linked in one way or another to all sectors of the city (imports, exports, generation, etc.), and its general objective is to make local economic activities more competitive in terms of the circular economy. Initially, 3 lines of action have been determined: (1) Promotion and development of the circular industrial, construction, services, commerce
and hotel and catering sectors; (2) Promotion of a responsible consumption model among citizens; (3) Development of efficient waste collection and management services that allow high levels of recycling.

This strategy will be aligned with the Mission objectives and may be the start of the path to tackle lowering Scope 3 emissions, an area in which Vitoria-Gasteiz would also like to become a benchmark model.

There are two particularly relevant areas for the Mission, insofar as they are related to proposed or future actions to reduce and/or absorb emissions in the Climate Action Plan: on the one hand, construction and especially renovation of buildings and circularity of the materials to be used, and on the other, the measures to be applied in the primary sector in relation to food.

Circularity of construction materials. The refurbishment of buildings or other refurbishment and new construction works represent a key opportunity to apply circular economy criteria in the construction sector and work will be carried out with the different actors in this sector to decarbonise it.
Agri-food Strategy of Vitoria-Gasteiz. The Vitoria-Gasteiz Agri-Food Strategy and its action plan (2017-2025) are going to be re-edited to achieve a strategy built on a shared vision by the key agents of the production and distribution sector, as well as an intersectoral and multi-stakeholder action plan. These plans estimate indirect emissions and implement actions that contribute to decarbonising both systems. The implementation of the Municipal Organic Farmers' Seedbed (Basaldea), which aims to attract and settle new organic farmers in the municipality, helping to diversify and increase local production as well as providing a solution to the problem of flooding in the area.

## (5) Green Infrastructure and carbon footprint reduction

The Urban Green Infrastructure of Vitoria-Gasteiz is made up of the Green Belt, parks and gardens, tree-lined streets and squares, green sports areas, urban orchards, streams, central reservations and roundabouts, vacant plots and other less conventional elements such as façades and green roofs. The Vitoria-Gasteiz Urban Green Infrastructure Strategy is being developed to improve the ecological, environmental and social functions of urban green spaces. This plan defines a system of chief areas on which to act, and a set of projects and interventions aiming to increase urban biodiversity (through naturalisation actions, creation of ponds and bird shelters...), improve water drainage (through the laying of permeable paving, the creation of rain gardens...), improve fixation of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  and other atmospheric pollutants (through the planting of trees...), etc. The estimated carbon sequestration capacity of urban trees is currently 2,295 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ /year. In addition, this green infrastructure will be promoted as an element that generates urban climate refuges, incorporating shading, evotranspiration and permeable surface objectives when planning and designing this structure.

2
The Green Belt (827 ha) is a semi-natural area comprising forests, rivers, wetlands, meadows, woodlands and hedgerows. The aim is to incorporate new degraded areas and/or areas with great potential to act as carbon sinks in the peri-urban environment into the multifunctional Green Belt project, through creating new parks and agri-ecological spaces (Larragorri, Mendebaldea, Idiazabal Project, etc.).

Reissue of the Urban Tree Master Plan with the aim of highlighting the benefits of trees, in addition to being a tool for thermal regulation of public spaces and a carbon sink.

Naturalisation of school playgrounds. The project aims to transform the outdoor spaces at schools to adapt them to climate change and incorporate them into the urban green infrastructure system, with active participation from the educational community.

Naturalisation of the old town: project to drive naturalisation of the old town. Possible actions include the planting of trees, climbing plants, landscaping, installation of flowerpots, etc. The project aims to co-create and test mechanisms to enable public-private management of the green infrastructure in the public space.

## 6) Intelligent data-driven management

The Vitoria-Gasteiz City Council is committed to promoting smart data-based management by facilitating the sharing and transparency of data. To this end, it will use the Geographic Information System built for the city and the digital model built within the framework of the European SmartEnCity project for the Coronación neighbourhood of the city. It will promote use, extension and adaptation of these digital tools in decision-making in an attempt to achieve climate neutrality. In the future, the ultimate goal would be to create a Digital Twin of Vitoria-Gasteiz, a virtual replica of the main elements of the city and its critical infrastructure, connected to databases and sensors, which will enable analysis, modelling, simulation and prediction of scenarios, and develop hypotheses to support better decision-making processes. It will also be necessary to work on a new innovative data governance and management model, by setting up a "Data Office".

This Climate Action Plan, set out below, is part of an iterative process together with the other documents/annexes of this Climate City Contract that will be subject to biennial monitoring, review and updating, to effectively contribute to climate neutrality in the city. A timeline of the steps to be taken until the next iteration is included in the Perspectives and Next Steps section of this Annex I.

3
The investment costs presented throughout the Vitoria-Gasteiz Climate City Contract respond to the economic model for decarbonising cities. This model estimates the incremental cost of the decarbonisation actions as a whole, in the sectors analysed by the Economic Model, presented in the action plan instead of their total cost. Thus, the incremental cost is the additional cost of a specific decarbonisation action compared to the cost of a reference scenario, such as the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario for the year 2030, in which it is assumed that current trends and policies remain unchanged and that no measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the city. Therefore, the cost presented throughout the document is an incremental cost, not a total cost, which reflects the additional cost required to carry out the decarbonisation actions in the action plan.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of the Baseline GHG Inventory

As a step prior to drafting the Vitoria-Gasteiz SECAP 2030, an emissions inventory was drawn up as a reference to understand the sources and magnitude of GHG emissions in the city. This inventory includes data on energy consumption and Scope 1 and 2 emissions from the various sectors of the city: public and private internal mobility, residential sector, tertiary sector, municipal facilities and services, including waste management, and the agricultural and livestock sector. The geographical boundary of the reference inventory is the entire city of Vitoria-Gasteiz.

The inventory accounts for emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) (expressed in CO₂ equivalents). Emissions of the following gases have not been considered: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF₆) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃) because no data are currently available on these gases.

The Economic Model produced for Vitoria-Gasteiz by Material Economics uses a "systemic" approach to account for the city's GHG emissions, which examines the entire urban system, including buildings and heating, transport, electricity and waste, and identifies emission sources and pathways. The model considers not only Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but also some Scope 3 emissions (from waste management, when this takes place outside the city limits).

Therefore, although both instruments share certain similarities, the Economic Model and the SECAP emissions inventory estimate GHG emissions differently. These different approaches to calculating emissions lead to a different quantification of the city's emissions between the two calculation methodologies, so that although the final results are similar, the different approaches of the two methodologies result in two different emission inventories.

To develop a comprehensive understanding of the city's emissions profile and identify the most cost-effective, efficient ways to reduce GHG emissions, the Vitoria-Gasteiz Climate City Contract will make extensive use of the emissions data provided by the Economic Model, so that the investments, costs and benefits presented in the model are consistent with the emissions resulting from it. Likewise, and given that the SECAP2030VG emissions inventory represents the starting point for calculating the Economic Model emissions, it has been considered appropriate to include some tables in this section to present the SECAP2030VG emissions inventory data. Thus, tables A-1.1, A-1.2(a) and A-1.4(a) correspond to the SECAP emissions inventory (which includes energy consumption and emissions from the industrial sector of the city), while the remaining tables (A-1.2(b), A-1.4(b) and A-1.4(c)) correspond to the Economic Model. It should also be noted that the remaining quantitative tables included in this Climate City Contract, starting with table A-2.3, present the data provided by the Economic Model.
It has been decided to take 2019 as the reference year, as the 2020 data are affected by the health crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Table A-1.1 shows the final energy consumption data from the 2019 energy consumption inventory for the sectors included in SECAP2030VG, residential building, tertiary, institutional, internal mobility, waste and primary sector, to which the consumption of the industrial sector has been added.

Table A-1.2(a) contains the emission factors applied in SECAP2030VG, while table A-1.2(b) contains the emission factors applied in the Economic Model.

Table A-1.3 shows the activity data by sector of origin used in the Economic Model.

Table A-1.4(a) shows the emissions of the sectors included in the SECAP2030VG, to which emissions of the industrial sector have been added, calculated from the data contained in tables A-1.1 and A-1.2(a) above.

Table A-1.4(b) shows the emissions estimated by sector by the Economic Model for 2019. Finally, table A-1.4(c) shows the **reference inventory** resulting from the projection of these emissions to 2030 (Business as Usual, BAU scenario) carried out with the Economic Model. This scenario represents a projection of what the city's emissions trajectory would look like if no additional decarbonisation measures were implemented beyond those already planned or underway.

Thus, the GHG emission reductions in 2030 will be calculated in relation to the emissions from the BAU 2030 scenario.

In the BAU2030 Economic Model scenario, the sector with the highest emissions is the electricity sector, with 35% of the total, followed by the building and heating sector, with 25%. The transport sector accounts for 16% of emissions, while the waste sector accounts for 2%. Finally, the model incorporates a sector called Other, which includes other sectors not modelled in the Economic Model, which in the case of Vitoria-Gasteiz are the industrial and primary sectors, together accounting for 22% of emissions.

The calculation is performed with the activity data in Table A-1.3. Activities by sector of origin (economic model input data) and the emission factors in Table A-1.2(b). Emission factors applied (economic model).

The Economic Model considers both the population variation in 2030 and all actions with an impact on the BAU2030 scenario, referring to an improvement in efficiency in the different building sectors (new buildings following a more demanding standard, thermal installations and efficient lighting), and mobility (cars, lorries and buses with lower consumption, etc.).

One important difference in the 2019 inventory of SECAP2030VG + Industry mentioned in the Economic Model is that in the latter, electricity becomes a sector in its own right, as its emissions are unbundled from other sectors (the Economic Model has used an electricity emission factor of 222 g CO₂ₑ/kWh compared to 197 g CO₂ₑ/kWh used in SECAP2030VG).

5
In addition, the Economic Model does not separately consider the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU) sectors, which are included in "Other", for which no emission reduction actions have been modelled. Further iterations of this Climate City Contract will include additional actions to those already considered in this first iteration to reduce emissions from the "Others" sector for the above sectors.

Finally, a series of graphs are provided to allow visualisation of the final energy use and GHG emissions data tables:

In order to have a complete GHG inventory, which includes gases not considered up to now (HFCs, PFCs, SF and NF) for all sectors and scopes considered in the

Mission, annual final energy consumption and GHG emissions inventories will be prepared for the period 2021-2030 for the municipality as a whole.

In the next iteration of this Climate City Contract will include the complete inventories corresponding to the years 2021-2023.

# A-2.2: Description and evaluation of policies

Vitoria-Gasteiz has a long tradition in drafting and implementing policies, strategies and action plans on environmental, economic and social sustainability, and other sectorial areas, such as mobility, waste management, air quality, etc.

Following a co-creation process, the Vitoria-Gasteiz Urban Agenda 2030 was approved in 2022 as a new strategic framework for the city's sustainable development. It includes 5 strategic challenges and 4 cross-cutting levers, and an action plan that articulates a total of 98 actions in terms of sustainability. Challenge 3 is to make Vitoria-Gasteiz green, climate-neutral, resilient and self-sufficient, through promoting energy transition, the circular economy and green infrastructures. One of its transversal levers is support and participation in European Missions, particularly regarding climate neutrality and adaptation.

In the field of climate action, the main tool available to promote energy transition and mitigate emissions is the Vitoria-Gasteiz Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP 2030). SECAP 2030 establishes a prior greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target for the diffuse sectors of 61.5% in 2030 in relation to the base year (2006) and a net GHG emission reduction target of 83%. The diffuse sectors covered by the target are: residential, services and institutional sectors, internal mobility, and the primary sector. The plan also aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. However, the plan schedules its own review within two years, in conjunction with other strategic planning instruments, such as the Urban Development City Plan (UDCP) or the Vitoria-Gasteiz Urban Agenda 2030 (AUVG2030), and sectoral planning, such as strategies and/or plans for mobility and public space, waste management, innovation and smart city, public procurement, etc., as well as the development of new regulations (e.g., the development of new legislation (e.g., the Urban Agenda 2030 of Vitoria-Gasteiz), as well as developing new regulations (energy ordinance, low emission zones, etc.), to adapt the ambition of climate neutrality and the quantitative targets to a more ambitious objective such as climate neutrality in 2030. The Economic Model used for Vitoria-Gasteiz actually implies this type of review to adjust the SECAP2030 target to climate neutrality in 2030.

The most significant actions in the energy field would be related to residential, tertiary and institutional building, through the renovation/rehabilitation of existing buildings (envelopes and heating and DHW installations), the electrification of demand, the integration of renewable energy systems, with mobility, through implementation of superblocks and their electrification, the efficient and decarbonised management of municipal services (public lighting, water cycle management, waste management, etc.). There is also the generation of renewable energy in situ and nearby, by promoting citizen energy communities and renewable energies, and installing photovoltaic self-consumption systems on building roofs and in public spaces, as well as extending a decarbonised heat network to all the city's neighbourhoods.

The strategies and actions already contemplated in the SECAP2030 should be accelerated, and additional ones incorporated, based on the results of the Economic Model.
As mentioned above, SECAP 2030 feeds into and complements other policy and/or planning tools at strategic and sectoral level such as spatial planning, building, mobility, circularity, innovation, green infrastructure, etc.

Within the framework of its Sustainable Mobility and Public Space Plan (PMSyEP), Vitoria-Gasteiz is already applying a new requalification and reorganisation of public space and an integrated approach to managing the local mobility system that provides more appropriate conditions to promote more efficient, sustainable and safe urban mobility, with a greater role for active travel and public transport. This formulation is based on a new road hierarchy, establishing a series of urban cells (superblocks), alongside integrating a wide range of actions over the whole urban mobility system and public space: electrification and improvement of collective public transport (Intelligent Electric Bus, Tram), traffic calming, pedestrian and cycle routes, parking regulation, micro-logistics solutions, secure bicycle parking, etc.

The PMSyEP, approved in October 2022 for the period 2021-2025, defines a long term (2030) scenario for private mobility, known as E3SM, derived, on the one hand, from implementing large public transport infrastructures (putting the railway underground, extending the tram lines, etc.), and on the other hand, from implementing superblocks throughout the urban area. Based on this scenario, a traffic reduction target of 33% has been set, which in terms of GHG emissions reduction represents a drop of 40%, which, together with progressive renewal of the fleet and introduction of electric vehicles, could mean lowering emissions by more than 56% in 2030 due to internal mobility in the city. This scenario has been assumed as the target scenario for SECAP 2030 in the field of mobility.

The 2021-2025 action plan establishes 9 strategic objectives among which we can highlight a commitment to climate change on the one hand, with the decarbonisation of mobility, and greater public awareness and governance committed to sustainable mobility on the other hand.

The most significant mobility actions that would affect lowering energy consumption and emissions in the mobility sector would be related to enhancement and electrification of public transport (buses and trams), improvement and extension of infrastructures to favour a modal shift to cycling and walking, rationalisation of the use of the private vehicle and creation of infrastructure to develop private electric vehicles, both for passenger and freight transport, improvement of logistics and urban freight transport and labour mobility, plus regulation-based measures, such as vehicle access regulations in Low Emission Zones (LEZs).

With regard to improving public transport and electrification projects, it should be noted that by implementing the Intelligent Electric Bus (BEI), 13 electric buses have been brought in, linking 14 districts, with a potential of 3 million users per year (reduction of 1,520 t CO2e/year). Extending the tram to the districts of Salburua in 2023, and subsequently to Zabalgana, should lead to a significant reduction in the use of private cars as both districts represent 20% of the total population of the city.

In relation to building policies and strategies, there is the Ekobarrios plan - Urban regeneration, eco-rehabilitation and revitalisation of vulnerable neighbourhoods in Vitoria-Gasteiz (2021-2030), which stems from a framework document called

6
"Master Plan for Urban Regeneration, Eco-Rehabilitation and Vitalisation of the Neighbourhoods of Vitoria-Gasteiz", which is expected to be the roadmap to follow over a twenty-year horizon (period 2021-2040). It is part of the project formulated by the Department of Territorial Planning, Housing and Transport of the Basque Government: "Nearly Zero Energy Neighbourhood (NZEN) - Opengela Programme: Incorporation of active and passive measures aimed at achieving buildings (residential and tertiary) with almost zero or positive energy balance and safer against the risk of fire, in vulnerable neighbourhoods."

Ekobarrios proposes the urban, social and environmental regeneration of the Medieval Quarter (Integrated Restoration Area) and the Degraded Areas (DA) declared in 9 neighbourhoods, built between the 1950s and 1970s in the city. The actions proposed seek to assist decarbonisation of the city and to this end the energy rehabilitation of its building stock (both public and private), improvement of accessibility, incorporation of green infrastructure and support for more sustainable mobility in the oldest areas of the city are fundamental, seeking to improve living conditions for residents in less favourable situations.

The experience amassed in the energy refurbishment project in the Coronación neighbourhood, part of the Horizon 2020 SmartandCity programme - creating carbon-neutral smart cities, is key to future action on energy improvements in residential and tertiary buildings. In the Coronación neighbourhood, a total of 524 equivalent dwellings were targeted to reduce energy demand and emissions (-3,054 MWh/year and -998 tCO2e/year) and increase the use of renewable energy by replacing fossil fuels with a district heating network, operating on biomass, with the capacity to power 1,300 homes. One of the most important lessons learned is the need to integrate neighbourhood participation in the project from the very beginning.

The Ekobarrios project is going to be initially deployed in the Zaramaga neighbourhood, by implementing the Urban Regeneration, Eco-rehabilitation and Vitalisation of the Zaramaga neighbourhood in Vitoria-Gasteiz. It consists of the urban, social and environmental regeneration of this neighbourhood, which was declared a Degraded Area. It is predominantly residential and most of the blocks of flats were built between the 60s and 70s using traditional construction systems. The proposed actions seek to assist decarbonisation of the city and therefore focus on energy rehabilitation for its building stock (both public and private), improving accessibility, incorporating green infrastructure, supporting more sustainable mobility as well as the basic infrastructure for a heating network at neighbourhood level. Refurbishment is proposed with energy efficiency criteria on envelopes and heating and DHW systems, interior ventilation of the dwellings with heat recovery systems, incorporation of renewable electricity generation resources. The refurbishment is accompanied by actions to renew public lighting, to promote active mobility (pedestrianisation of streets and reconversion of infrastructures for pedestrian use), to promote sustainable mobility and electric mobility infrastructures, construction and refurbishment of parks, installation of sustainable urban drainage systems (SDUs), as well as energy installations on a neighbourhood scale, such as the basic infrastructure for a district heating network.

In relation to urban waste management, the Álava Waste Prevention and Management Plan (2017-2030) is developed on the basis of ten strategic objectives, which define and budget for 80 actions, split into three action programmes:

i. Governance and Strategic Measures, which brings together the cross-cutting measures, applicable to all municipal waste streams.

ii. infrastructure, which brings together measures affecting the infrastructure supporting waste management, and

iii. other support measures to improve prevention and manage priority flows, bringing together specific measures to improve prevention and management of certain specific flows, such as organic matter, food waste, light packaging and bulky waste.

The plan’s strategic objectives revolve around prevention, with a target of reducing the weight of municipal waste by more than 15% in 2030 compared to 2015, preparation for reuse, reaching a minimum of 5% by weight of the total municipal waste produced, recycling, reaching a minimum of 65%, and finally, safe disposal, reducing the percentage of waste ending its life cycle in landfill to a maximum of 15%. Finally, another strategic objective revolves around environmental sustainability, reducing the environmental and health impact of the municipal waste management system, especially its GHG emissions.

The Vitoria-Gasteiz City Council's Industry Plan includes a specific line of work to promote the transition of the city's productive sector towards circular business models with a low climate impact. It works at three levels: company, sector and productive area.

Business: the municipal resources available to local companies include financial aid for circular economy projects (eco-design, servitisation, remanufacturing, recovery of secondary materials), the advisory service on circular business models and the carbon footprint calculation and reduction service, the Laboratory City programme to facilitate testing in real environments of developments at high levels of technological maturity (TRL) or the Basque Circular Hub (the result of collaboration with Ihobe - the Basque Government's Public Society for Environmental Management).
Sector: development of projects anchoring milestones with sectors such as tourism, the repair sector, urban businesses (commerce-hospitality-personal services), etc.
Productive zone: bringing the circular perspective into management of industrial zones based on an ecosystemic approach to productive zones, analysing the flows of materials in and out of them, and estimating the potential to develop industrial symbiosis initiatives.

All in all, the aim is for local companies to become active agents contributing to the objectives of circularity of materials and decarbonisation of Vitoria-Gasteiz’s economy.

Vitoria-Gasteiz has a Conservation of Biodiversity strategy, an exhaustive analysis-diagnosis of the aquatic, agricultural, livestock and forestry environments of the city and, to a lesser extent, the artificialized environment, and proposes a good number

8
of measures and actions aimed at their protection, conservation and improvement. With specific reference to the urban environment, the document's action plan includes "drafting a Green Infrastructure Plan specifically for the urban environment, which defines its elements and determines the necessary actions to conserve or promote its biodiversity and ensure its multifunctionality, including its appropriate integration into urban planning."

The Vitoria-Gasteiz Urban Green Infrastructure System or Plan (2015) pursues a series of general objectives, such as enhancing biodiversity in the city, increasing spatial and functional connectivity between urban and peri-urban green spaces, increasing ecosystem services, favouring urban metabolism processes closer to natural processes, reducing the consumption of natural resources, integrating ecological and hydrological processes and flows into the urbanised fabric through appropriate planning, mitigation of urban heat islands, slowing down climate change, and improving the conditions and processes of adapting to it, increasing the resilience of the territory and reducing its vulnerability. Other general objectives would be to promote compatible public use of green spaces, increasing opportunities for leisure and recreation, increasing accessibility and rural-urban connections, preserving cultural heritage and traditional landscapes, creating environments that favour health, collective well-being and the city's general liveability. Finally, the plan seeks to assist local economic development through green employment and to raise awareness on the nature-biodiversity-society relationship, particularly regarding ecosystem goods and services, including their economic valuation.

One of the city's most important green infrastructure systems is its Green Belt (827 ha), a semi-natural space made up of forests, rivers, wetlands, meadows, groves and hedges, which surrounds the city centre and brings nature closer to the city. It has more than 265,000 trees, a total leaf area of 12.11 km² and more than 12,000 tonnes of carbon stored in plant tissue. In addition, it has an estimated carbon sequestration capacity of 3,168 tonnes of CO₂/year and eliminates 564 tonnes of air pollution (PM).

Alava is over 80% forest land, with more than 100 million tonnes of CO₂ amassed and an absorption rate of 600,000 t CO₂/year. Vitoria-Gasteiz has almost 8,600 hectares of forest land, contributing significantly to CO₂ accumulation. It is estimated that around 8% of the total accumulated CO₂ in the province is found in the city's forests.

An initial conservative estimate stated that the CO₂ fixation rate of the forest mass in the city is around 40,000 tonnes of CO₂/year. Another 4,900 tonnes of CO₂/year should be added to that, fixed by the area of crops and pastures in the city. If the sink effect of urban greenery (Green Belt and trees in parks and streets) is also considered, more than 4,000 tonnes of CO₂/year can be added.

Other sink absorption projects are also envisaged, such as carbon sequestration in farmland (2020-22): ongoing quantification with the Neiker R&amp;D centre and the Municipal Incubator for organic farmers (Basaldea) aims to attract and settle new organic farmers in the city, helping to diversify and increase local production.

A strategy for residual emissions is developed in section B-2.3.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers

A number of cross-cutting systemic barriers have been identified, related to insufficient skills, inefficient processes and/or procedures, lack of infrastructure or economic funds, or the need for collaboration between public and private stakeholders, which could hinder progress towards climate neutrality:

Insufficient administrative and/or operational capacity. On the one hand, this is due to a lack of personnel and the existing difficulty of bringing in additional staff, including temporary staff. On the other hand, there is a need for specialised technical staff, who can adapt to new professional profiles, incorporate a cross-cutting vision of the administration and public policies, and work with a project mentality.

Regulatory bureaucracy. On the one hand, a proliferation of regulations and standards has been detected, and on the other hand, some procedures are too cumbersome and too restrictive, which do not facilitate the efficiency and timely response required by the different agents' problems and demands. The need to seek a balance between security/efficiency and transparency.

Lack of consolidated and unified monitoring and verification procedures

Low digitalisation, which prevents or delays digital transformation. Resistance to change. Cost. Lack of skills. Lack of supply adapted to the market (infrastructure, devices and solutions, etc.). Security. Legal uncertainty. Lack of management commitment. In many organisations, the biggest barrier to digital transformation is legacy thinking, coupled with a lack of willingness from IT departments already exhausted by radical change.

Fragmentation of responsibilities: Silo functioning between different departments or between different institutions. Multidimensional/systemic and complex problems require innovative governance models, which facilitate multi-level relationships, policy integration, and project work, beyond the current departmental structure.

Difficulties in building public-private partnerships. A well-established and innovative legal framework is needed. Different perspective on expectations. New ideas, innovative clauses, as well as overcoming the traditional "public" concept are needed. Difficulty in finding the balance between public and private.

Lack of funding/financing schemes: need for new thinking beyond subsidies

Prohibitive investment costs: New technologies, new solutions for climate action require very high and sometimes prohibitive costs.

Difficulty in accessing specialised knowledge.

From a sectoral point of view, a number of barriers are also identified in the main strategies being proposed.

Specifically, for example, in urban regeneration and energy rehabilitation of dwellings, the
main problem is that the vast majority of residential buildings are **privately owned**, forming communities of owners. This makes it **difficult to reach agreements** to refurbish common elements, as this cannot be done without a majority agreement. Another important barrier is that owners must make a **significant initial outlay** for the refurbishment, making it difficult to start such projects, with high costs for the renovation of the envelopes and difficulty to accurately predict the renovation outcome. Another barrier might be the need for assistance in **identifying the representatives** of the various owners' associations, through contacts with the city's *Administradores de Fincas*, to whom they can report directly. The difficulty of dealing with the renovation of **protected buildings** is evident. Citizen assistance facilities should also be able to explain the benefits, costs, procedures and necessary grants so that it is perceived as easy, affordable and feasible.

In relation to heating systems, decarbonisation through heat pump substitution requires upfront financing, with the associated risk that extensive electrification of heat could severely strain the electricity grid.

In **mobility** policies, the greatest risk or barrier is **resistance** from the population to **change habits** and the role of the private car in our society, plus the risk of implementing relatively unpopular political decisions. Several areas would be affected by the required behavioural changes, such as change to the working model to accept a new way of working, such as working from home (in addition to the possible physical and technological limitations of remote access to information or the availability of a laptop). There are also changes related to car-sharing, to resolve any queries concerning sharing a car with strangers, in addition to the limited number of existing platforms. Similarly, perceived disadvantages must be overcome, such as distrust or additional travel time, by people who want to change their mode of transport and use public transport on a daily basis.

There may also be **an economic barrier** to accessing electric vehicles in certain social sectors, due to their higher cost compared to combustion vehicles. There is also a perception that the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles falls short. Subsidies for certain fuels do not facilitate the transition towards decarbonisation.

In relation to the decarbonisation of **freight transport**, the main barrier to reducing and optimising logistics is the need for **intense collaboration** between the municipal administration and the numerous private agents, plus the need for a change in behaviour among people and organisations with regard to managing freight distribution. In addition, the electrification of distribution vehicles implies a **significant investment** in renewing fleets (in addition to the limited range of existing electric vehicles) and of charging infrastructures in distribution centres, which will require financing formulas.

In the case of the **energy sector**, and fundamentally in the case of energy generation facilities, and specifically for renewable installations, several barriers to their implementation have been detected, such as **restrictions on their location and construction**, limitations in current **regulations**, as well as the **high capital costs** necessary to undertake the investment, and therefore the **need for financing**. The existence of subsidies for certain fuels does not

9
facilitate the transition to decarbonisation either. Another barrier to the necessary energy transition would concern the citizens' lack of energy empowerment, and the difficulty of getting them involved in the energy system by setting up energy communities.

In the case of **waste management**, the main barrier is the **insufficient participation** of citizens and businesses in selective separation of waste at source, which leads, on the one hand, to insufficient waste separation, and on the other hand, to low quality separated waste, which makes recycling processes inefficient and leads to downcycling. In addition, some waste prevention actions are ineffective due to low reuse rates.

Finally, some of the systemic opportunities for climate action in the city's ecosystem are outlined in section C of this Action Plan.

The investment costs presented throughout the Vitoria-Gasteiz Climate City Contract are based on the Economic Model for city decarbonisation. This model estimates the incremental cost of all decarbonisation actions within the sectors it addresses rather than their total cost. Thus, the incremental cost is the additional cost of a specific decarbonisation action compared to the cost of a reference scenario, such as the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario for the year 2030, in which current trends and policies are assumed to remain unchanged. Therefore, the cost presented throughout the document is an incremental cost, not a total cost, reflecting the additional cost required to carry out the plan's decarbonisation actions in the sectors covered by the Economic Model. However, an estimate of the total costs per sector has been included in the action sheets.

An initial scenario is suggested which consists of reducing tillage in the city's major crops: cereal crops, fodder crops and industrial crops. Reducing tillage involves moving from conventional tillage to minimum tillage, where surface tillage is carried out and mechanical weeding is reduced by applying herbicides with low environmental impact.
A second scenario is proposed, which consists of moving from minimum tillage to direct sowing of the city's major crops. Direct seeding consists of reducing actions to a minimum, the soil is not worked from the crop harvest until the next crop is sown, weed control is carried out by applying herbicides with low environmental impact.  |

B-2.3: Summary of residual emissions strategy

According to data from the Basque Statistics Institute (EUSTAT), the forested area in Alava totals 141,211 ha, of which 28% are conifers and 72% broadleaved. One distinctive feature is the large area occupied by natural masses, practically 80% of the total wooded surface area. In addition, 76% of the forests are protected as Montes de Utilidad Pública (Public Utility Forests).

Alava's forests are an excellent carbon sink, accumulating more than 100 million tonnes of CO₂, according to the Mugarri Plan for the Promotion of Renewable Energy in Alava. In addition, the almost 100 million existing trees absorb 600,000 tonnes of CO₂ per year.

The city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, capital of the Historical Territory of Alava, represents 9.1% of the total surface area of Alava (although in terms of population it represents more than 75%). Likewise, the forests of Vitoria-Gasteiz have important potential as CO₂ sinks.

In fact, the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz has almost 8,600 ha of forest land, contributing significantly to CO₂ accumulation. It is estimated that around 8% of the total CO₂ accumulated in Alava is found in forests of the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz.

The dominant forest formation in the municipality is the gall oak groves, which occupy more than 2,500 ha, the second largest being the kermes oak groves, which occupy 2,000 ha; beech groves are also well-represented in the municipality, occupying more than 1,000 ha, as well as oak groves, which occupy some 400 ha, extending over different forest formations. In addition, the city is home to more than 600 ha of forest plantations, both hardwood and coniferous.

In addition, the city has a cultivated area of just over 13,000 ha, which represents almost half of the municipal surface area (47%), plus an area dedicated to pastureland of over 3,300 ha, which represents 12% of the total.

Cultivated plants fix CO₂ as they grow, but they do not accumulate it in the soil when removed; only a small proportion from roots and crop residues can be incorporated into agricultural soils (0.33 tCO₂/ha). Although grassland has low capacity to fix CO₂ and incorporate it into the soil (0.17 tCO₂/ha), it can also contribute to some extent as a sink.

An initial, conservative estimate has put the annual absorption capacity of the city's forests at around 40,000 tonnes of CO₂, which, when added to the almost 4,900 tonnes of CO₂ absorbed by crops and pastures, would amount to around 45,000 tonnes of CO₂ absorbed per year.

While playing a more modest role in terms of its potential as a sink, urban greenery is not negligible. The Green Belt, with an area of more than 827 ha, has been calculated to absorb 3,168 tonnes of CO₂ per year. In addition, the city has a park and garden area of approximately 275 ha and urban trees (49 ha), which could absorb an additional 1,000 tonnes of CO₂.
Considering all of the above, the total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ absorption capacity of the city was initially estimated at around 49,000 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

The residual GHG emissions to be offset annually according to the targets of this Climate Action Plan amount to 162,000 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in 2030, these are emission sources that cannot be fully mitigated by 2030 due to lack of technological availability or economic resources.

However, the natural geographical scope for offsetting these GHG emissions would not be the municipal territory but should be extended to the bioregion which includes Vitoria-Gasteiz (Central Alava), since bioregions can become the spaces from which to deploy the new paradigms/strategies of sustainability, in general terms, and of climate neutrality in particular.

Specifically, Vitoria-Gasteiz is part of the so-called Llanada Alavesa, which in turn is one of the three counties in the bioregion of Central Alava. With 27,630 ha, Vitoria-Gasteiz represents just over a third of the surface area of the Llanada Alavesa, but is home to over $93\%$ of its population.

The surface area of forests in the Llanada Alava amounts to 28,806 ha (12% coniferous and 88% broadleaved), including forest in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz.

On the one hand, this would be a matter of increasing the current sink capacity due to urban and peri-urban green areas and crops and pastures respectively in the city. On the other hand, it would increase the forested area. The remaining emissions would be offset by taking advantage of the absorption capacity of the forests that form part of the Llanada Alavesa, which can provide an absorption capacity of around 130,000 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

Therefore, the strategy to compensate Vitoria-Gasteiz's emissions aims to increase the city's carbon sink capacity, both through fixing carbon in biomass and in soils derived from forestry and agricultural activities and by absorbing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ through green and blue urban and peri-urban infrastructures.

Forest areas, as already mentioned, have the greatest potential for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ fixation and accumulation. Certain land use activities and change in land use, such as agricultural land management (conservation agriculture, etc.) and pastures, as well as forestry activities, such as afforestation and reforestation, through tree plantations, restoration of degraded areas, and sustainable forest management, are intended to be promoted as sinks. In addition, the aim is to increase the sink capacity of urban greenery and urban green infrastructure, either by enhancing the use of tree species that capture more $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and consume fewer water resources, or by promoting nature-based solutions (NBS), such as green roofs and facades, urban orchards, edible forests and gardens, pollinator meadows, etc.

1
In relation to the decarbonisation of the agricultural sector, the main strategy should be to harness the capacity of regenerative agriculture and organic fertilisation to improve pastures and crops as carbon sinks and to increase the energy efficiency of the agricultural sector in terms of emissions (bioenergy use).

Through the Community Urban Gardens Programme, actions will be carried out to consolidate and expand the network of urban gardens in various neighbourhoods of the city, with the aim of providing people, groups and non-profit organisations with a space in which to develop the practice of ecological urban horticulture. These gardens, in addition to densifying the current urban green infrastructure, with the significant benefits that this entails, are proposed as spaces in which to carry out various educational and training activities and programmes aimed at a wide range of people and groups, including specific activities related to raising public awareness on the threats and impacts of climate change. The action also contemplates analysing the possibilities of locating new urban ecological gardens in the city's various neighbourhoods to give continuity to existing gardens (Zabalgana, Salburua, Lakua, Abetxuko, etc.).

Given that the precise determination of carbon sinks and storage is currently a challenge, it will be necessary to have the methodological guidance and technical support of the Mission's support platform (NetZeroCities) or other expert support.

In the same way, it will be necessary to study and assess the role that carbon credits can play in offsetting residual emissions, for which it will be necessary to have the support of expert knowledge.

C-1.2: Description of organisational and governance interventions

## Strategy Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 - Urban Agenda of Vitoria-Gasteiz

The Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 Strategy - Vitoria-Gasteiz Urban Agenda is the comprehensive and participatory roadmap to transform the city with a view to 2030, to implement the SDGs and their goals by means of 98 actions. It has been drawn up on the basis of a process shared between public agents (political groups and municipal technical departments) and private agents (other public institutions, economic and social agents, associated and non-associated citizens, etc.). Five strategic challenges have been determined, including making Vitoria-Gasteiz green, climate-neutral, resilient and self-sufficient, and four transversal levers, which affect many dimensions: technical-political, public-private, citizens, and global challenges. The city's participation in the two European climate change challenges (Climate Mission and Adaptation Mission) is expressly included in the last of these dimensions. This guarantees that the public policies developed in this decade will focus on climate neutrality and improve resilience, in line with VG's two European missions. Likewise, the internal governance structure created to draft and develop the strategy, both political (political committee) and technical (cross-cutting teams formed by the departments, autonomous agencies and municipal public companies) enables the Mission to be developed transversely, as well as multilevel governance between various levels of public administrations. The Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 Urban Agenda Strategy includes developing a Circularity Strategy for Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 and the Industry Plan, which sets in motion the Industry Roundtable. This is a space where business associations, companies located in various industrial areas and the city council can work together. It currently supports industrial digitalisation, diversification of activity, and the transition to a circular and decarbonised economy. It aspires to become a public-private governance space following the objectives and general governance of the mission.

## Sustainable Climate and Energy Action Plan (SECAP VG 2030)

The Vitoria-Gasteiz Sustainable Energy Action and Climate Plan (PACES 2030) is the strategic starting framework and part of the roadmap for the city's action on energy transition and climate change mitigation. The SECAP has established governance, which on the one hand is aligned with compliance in terms of energy sustainability regulations, and on the other hand, will form an integral part of the general governance determined for the mission.

## Mission-oriented participatory budgeting

The Vitoria-Gasteiz Hobetuz programme is a direct tool for participation and management of the city, through which citizens can suggest and decide how part of the municipal budgets might be spent. For the 2022-2023 edition, 3 million euros have been earmarked of which €200,000 has been set aside for proposals made by children. The programme is committed to active citizenship that participates and takes co-responsibility for improvements to the city, understanding that citizen participation in public management is key. The programme is inspired by principles (inclusivity, influence, gender, collaboration, learning, etc.) that should explicitly drive progress towards decarbonisation of the city, as well as intensifying the value of the Mission's weighting criteria to select projects.

## Multi-level platform / Multi-stakeholder space missions

A space created to contrast strategies, cooperate in implementation and creation of actions, and share experiences in relation to the climate neutrality goal. This platform will represent all the city's relevant stakeholders and will bring together the distributed leadership necessary to make the Mission a success. It will enable stakeholders from various sectors to coordinate their management with the mission's objective in their respective economic, business, social, research, communication, sectors.

It will help us build ownership of the process with all stakeholders in our partnership, develop new avenues for collaboration, drive and rewarding engagement, and connect, share and celebrate our successes with other communities. This will give us a common goal with a shared vision of Vitoria-Gasteiz for the year 2030.

Work is currently underway to develop the concept, structure, objectives and tasks of this space/platform and support will be sought from NetZeroCities and citiES2030 and all others deemed necessary to include elements of innovation.

## Climate Neutrality Office

A climate neutrality office has been planned in coordination with the Multi-Level-Multi-Stakeholder Platform.

6
This office is conceived as a space to bring together, coordinate and provide technical support to political, technical-administrative and socio-economic governance of the two European Climate Missions - the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission and the Climate Change Adaptation Mission. It aims to become the focal point of the Missions, the body to which all stakeholders will turn in the first instance and from which they will be called upon to participate. Work is currently underway to develop the concept, structure, objectives and tasks of this office and support will be sought from NetZeroCities and citiES2030 and any others deemed necessary to include aspects of innovation.

## Ensanche 21: Renovation Society of Vitoria-Gasteiz

Work is currently underway to transform the Ensanche 21 Zabalgunea S.A. Municipal Company from an organisation which managed municipal land in the expansion areas of the city into a company whose main objective is renovation, regeneration and urban renewal. It should become a rehabilitation agent for the city. It should also proactively search for solutions to manage initiatives in cooperation with citizens, strengthening its work as an interlocutor between guilds and banks, as well as a renovation agent or delegated promoter. This company is currently coordinating the Urban Regeneration Project in the Zaramaga neighbourhood.

## University-VG/Technology and Research Centres-VG pairings

We are currently working on an agreement with the San Sebastian School of Architecture so that students can work on subjects related to the Urban Strategy and renovation urban planning with real examples from the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz. In the future, these agreements are expected to be extended to other faculties and universities such as the University of the Basque Country and the University of Mondragón. Agreements are also in the pipeline with the Alava Technology Park or with the CIC Energigune or BC3.

## Mission communication strategy

Work is required on designing a communication strategy and the development and implementation of the different actions and/or associated communication campaigns. In this strategy, the following concepts will have to be considered:

What key messages do we want to convey?
What does the Climate City Contract mean for your city?
What do we find difficult to communicate?

Considering our target audience, the language to be used, innovation in communication actions, etc. Both for the design of the Strategy and for the development of the different actions, the necessary support and aid will be sought both within and outside the framework of the Mission.

C-2.2: Description of social and other innovation actions

## Public Procurement of Innovation for the circular economy and climate neutrality

Public procurement of innovation represents an invaluable tool with which to articulate and shape the challenges of climate neutrality by 2030, strengthening collaboration from public-private capital required to transform the city economically and socially. Public demand is the means to develop new innovative products and services with an impact on the climate mission to solve pressing public needs. Some areas which might be impacted are related to sustainable mobility and last-mile logistics for goods, shared self-consumption and distributed energy resources, as well as decarbonisation and increasing the resilience of the existing housing stock.

## Green Deal Community

"Green Deal" is a community of companies and business organisations in Vitoria-Gasteiz that are working on the transition to business models that require fewer natural resources and have a lower climate impact, where large and small companies share common spaces and all companies have something to contribute. More than five hundred companies, organisations and business entities have demonstrated their commitment by joining the Green Deal Community and incorporating good sustainable practices in their day-to-day work to make their business more efficient and open up new markets. The member companies bring sustainable environmental management measures into their day-to-day operations, encouraging better business development. These measures can be applied in very different aspects, grouped into 4 main areas: (1) circular economy (fewer materials in production, and less waste generated, working on eco-design and taking into account the life cycle of products), (2) carbon footprint (changes in habits to lower energy consumption, changing the mode of travel and optimising routes to receive supplies or deliver products, plus using renewable energies), (3) water footprint (introduction of water-saving technologies or modification of consumption habits), and (4) environmental awareness (actions to disseminate care for the environment by bringing more agents into sustainability).

The Mission can be an additional stimulus to make progress in policies by working from a community-of-interest perspective on the decarbonisation of our city.

## Municipal innovation grants

Calls for subsidies and grants aimed at developing activities or programmes complementary to municipal ventures, specified annually in a Strategic Subsidy Plan. The current strategic lines of action included in the Strategic Subsidy Plan will be completed with a strategic line of action aimed at innovation projects oriented towards the Climate Mission for cities, offering financial support to innovative projects related to building refurbishment, energy communities, energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, circular economy, etc. The selection criteria for the projects to be subsidised will be related to the potential impact of the project on climate neutrality, private investment to complement the subsidy, as well as the project's capacity for social involvement and mobilisation. Likewise, the other municipal subsidy lines will incorporate mission-oriented criteria to define their respective projects.

## Vitoria-Gasteiz laboratory city

The programme aims to promote public-private collaboration to facilitate companies with innovative technological products or circular economy solutions to experiment and implement them in real environments in the city. The aims would be to help local companies test, monitor and trial their technological development to validate or improve it, achieving optimal performance under real conditions, promote development of their own technology and make it known to potential customers, as well as attract companies and external knowledge to test their innovations in the city, to the benefit of local companies. The aim would be to update the programme, especially favouring innovative products or solutions with direct implications for the Mission, both in terms of decarbonisation and digitalisation.

## Energy Communities in rural entities

This is a strategy to develop circular renewable energy projects with citizen participation and empowerment through setting up an Energy Community in rural entities, in which the aim is to achieve the circularity of the biomass resource, as it will come from the environment, using it for thermal purposes in the entity itself (heating and hot water), and also promoting local employment. Local energy generation will be a step forward
in its energy sovereignty towards an equitable energy system promoted by citizens.

A pilot project is being developed by Aberasturi Council, intended to be scaled up to as many Councils in the city area as possible, which would have a clear impact on the Mission, with potential replication of the technical, economic and participatory model. The innovative nature of the project lies, on the one hand, in the participatory process of the residents, who have been involved from the beginning of the project, and on the other hand, in the origin of the biomass, as district heating installations are usually fed by forest or agricultural biomass, but not both.

## Ecological Agriculture Project / Basaldea Agri-ecological Business Centre

The Basaldea project comprises a set of actions targeting changes in a series of cultural, behavioural and consumer habits, (1) The Basaldea Agri-ecological Business Centre is an agri-incubator generating new ecological agriculture farms aimed at entrepreneurs who wish to develop this kind of project, making land, equipment and common infrastructures available to them. (2) Training in ecological agriculture, aimed at people with training or experience in the agricultural sector or with an interest in working professionally in organic farming and with the possibility of becoming self-employed on land belonging to the Basaldea Centre. Training in bio-intensive regenerative agriculture, programmes working with the Slow Food movement, etc. (3) Fixed distribution and marketing channel for organic products, with participation from the city's Central Market.

## Collaboration with social innovation centres (Agirre Lehendakari Center)

Experiences developed so far indicate that the main challenge when implementing European missions is to connect socio-ecological transition processes with social and community dynamics. Despite all the efforts made in this respect, the communities where the Missions take place do not tend to embrace them.

Incorporating a social innovation approach will help us to reinforce the community dimension of the urban mission-driven experimentation portfolio through (1) exhaustive mapping of the whole ecosystem so we can visualise and reinforce unusual connections in real time, (2) segmentation of the different ways of perceiving the need and impact of the mission, (3) generating new multi-stakeholder deliberative spaces with a community approach (sensemaking), and (4) establishing a co-creation and prototyping system with a portfolio approach that can be adaptively managed. As an extra, social innovation tools offer us the possibility of incorporating a communication perspective and evolutionary (developmental) evaluation into the process.

It will seek to establish a participatory innovation approach through a partnership agreement with the Agirre Lendakari Center (ACL) to bring in a mission-focused project to implement deep listening with stakeholders and the wider community as a tool to increase capacity to identify their needs, come to better and more reliable complex decisions, drive their commitments to formulate their own solutions and take responsibility for their follow-up, and change perceptions about the scale, scope and speed of implementing changes to achieve neutrality.

## Financing of Action Portfolio (Economic Case)

The investment costs presented throughout the Vitoria-Gasteiz Climate City Contract are based on the Economic Model for decarbonisation of cities. This model estimates the incremental cost of all decarbonisation actions in the sectors it covers rather than their total cost. Thus, the incremental cost is the additional cost of a specific decarbonisation action compared to the cost of a reference scenario, such as the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario for the year 2030, in which current trends and policies are assumed to remain unchanged. Therefore, the cost presented throughout the document is an incremental cost, not a total cost, reflecting the additional cost required to carry out the decarbonisation actions of the action plan in the sectors covered by the Economic Model.

# Introduction

At a crucial moment in the global response to climate-related emergencies, the European Union has committed to lead on climate action and has set the targets and legislation to achieve this. Member States must reduce their emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by mid-century. In this context, cities have a key role to play, both in accelerating the decarbonisation process and in ensuring a fair and equitable transformation that contributes to the well-being of society as a whole.

Despite occupying only about 3% of the earth's surface, cities generate more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions and consume more than 65% of global energy. It is also important that they act as experimental, innovative hubs in the transition to climate neutrality.

The EU Mission "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" aims to support city transformation to accelerate implementation of the Paris Agreement, and to become both a catalyst and driver to implement the European Green Deal, demonstrating that climate neutrality by 2050 is a real possibility.

In Spain, the Government of Spain and the City Councils of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville and Valencia signed the "Climate Neutral Cities in 2030" declaration on 8 September 2021, to boost to the commitments and initiatives from the signatory cities and demonstrate government support for these cities' transformation to achieve climate neutrality and become more resilience. Following in this wake, the City Councils of Soria, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza signed the Declaration on 13 December.

Furthermore, on 15 September 2021, the senate Plenary approved a motion urging the Government to promote climate neutrality of cities within the framework of the European Cities Mission. The motion recognised cities' fundamental role in response to the climate emergency and highlights the opportunity to accelerate the necessary and cross-cutting changes to make cities climate neutral by 2030. It also appreciates that the different territorial administrations promote and facilitate Spanish cities' climate neutrality by joining the Cities Mission and developing transformation projects.

In this regard, on 25 November 2021, the Cities Mission launched a call for expression of interest addressed to European cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants interested in taking part. Of the 377 that applied, 100 European cities were selected from the EU-27, including the Spanish cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza.

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz
Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

The Mission Implementation Plan foresees that each of the 100 selected cities will develop a City Climate Neutral Contract adapted to its own circumstances, through a co-creation process working closely with the whole of civil society and all citizens, explaining the strategy to deploy and monitor innovative and digital solutions that target climate neutrality; and enabling other cities to follow suit by 2050. This document is therefore a clear political commitment, not only to the European Commission and national, regional and local authorities, but also to citizens. It includes a comprehensive climate action plan in sectors such as energy, buildings, waste management and transport, plus the corresponding investment plans.

This document thereby responds to the requirements of the European Cities Mission. It has been drafted by the city, with participation from citizens and other public and private agents and sets out plans to achieve climate neutrality. The document particularly recognises that the Mission cannot succeed without a solid anchor in the local community to garner broad support. It therefore involves civil society, youth groups, cultural institutions and creative sectors, foundations, local media, small and medium-sized enterprises, private industry, trade unions, academia and research, and the public sector, among others, in their respective roles as decision-makers, users, consumers, producers and owners.

Furthermore, the document integrates the city's own qualities and heritage, which ensure not only the local dimension of this transition to climate neutrality, but also makes it inclusive, in line with the New European Bauhaus values (beautiful, sustainable, together). It fosters a sense of belonging and ownership by the city's inhabitants and professional agents, showing the relevance of their unique contribution and that compliance with this document will bring about better quality of life and a better environment for all.

On the other hand, the document comes within the framework of an iterative process, as a document that will be subject to monitoring and updating, by signing addenda and other adhesion documents, thus bringing together other agents for the city to achieve the goal of climate neutrality. In particular, the commitments set out document may be expanded or updated to contribute effectively to achieving climate neutrality in the city.

The document is divided into several parts: one concerning the cities' commitment to achieve climate neutrality in the city; another explains institutional support and coordination of the different public administrations; another part outlines its monitoring and updating; and a final part comprise the annexes corresponding to the Climate Action Plan, the City Climate Investment Plan and the City Stakeholders and Commitments, which follow the models developed by NetZeroCities¹.

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

# Commitment of the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz to climate neutrality

## Introduction

The city of Vitoria-Gasteiz aspires to be climate neutral by 2030, a very ambitious goal based on a long-held conviction that sustainability is the way to improve people's lives without compromising the needs of future generations and without renouncing economic and social development and environmental protection. In this context, Vitoria-Gasteiz also aspires to become a resilient, metabolically-efficient and biodiverse municipality by 2030. It intends to foster a vibrant and committed social fabric in a safe, healthy and inclusive environment, within an attractive and prosperous economic system (a challenge of our Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 Urban Agenda (AU2030VG)).

Vitoria-Gasteiz' has been on a constant, consistent road to sustainability since the 1990s. A pathway has been backed up by a series of climate policies and strategies. Some of the most important milestones along the way illustrate and sum up the city's entire pathway:

+ 1995: The Charter of European Sustainable Cities and Towns (Aalborg Charter) was signed, making it the first Spanish city to do so.
+ 1998: Approval of the Vitoria-Gasteiz Local Agenda 21. A very important turning point for environmental policies and subsequently social and economic issues. The first action plans were drawn up (2003-2007 and 2010-2014), with a framework of sustainability indicators to monitor action plans (annual monitoring reports issued between 1998 and 2020).
+ 2008: Joining the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, Europe (Covenant of Mayors), and commitment to European sustainability policies.
+ 2010: Approval of the Plan to Combat Climate Change for Vitoria-Gasteiz (2010-2020). This first sustainable energy action plan (SEAP) set a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction target of 25.7% on the base year (2006). Finally, thanks to successful implementation of the plan, GHG emissions were reduced by 31.4% in 2020.
+ 2012: European Green Capital, recognition of the joint effort and commitment to the environment from the citizens and the various urban agents.

+ 2016: Basque Declaration - New roadmap for European cities and towns: creating productive, sustainable and resilient municipalities for a liveable and inclusive Europe.
+ 2019: Vitoria-Gasteiz receives the Global Green City Award (from the Global Forum on Human Settlements) – further recognition of the collective effort and commitment made to the environment by our citizens and our city.
+ 2020: Renewal of the Commitment to the Covenant of Mayors. This commitment was demonstrated by preparing and approving the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan for Vitoria-Gasteiz (SECAP 2030) with a time frame of 2030.

SECAP 2030 is the main tool used to organise all action on energy transition, mitigation and adaptation to climate change in the city. It comprise two interrelated action plans: the Integrated Energy Transition Action Plan (PATEI) and the Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan (PAACC).

In the field of energy transition and emission mitigation, the SECAP2030 sets the following targets for 2030 compared to the base year (2006):

Reduce energy consumption by 29%.
Reduce direct GHG emissions by 61.5%.
Reduce net GHG emissions by 83.1%.

It also set specific adaptation goals for Vitoria-Gasteiz, defined according to the results of the impact chains evaluated in the risk diagnosis on the city as a whole:

Droughts on rural areas: reduce the risk associated with farming, due to the possible effects of climate change, by strengthening farmers' ability to adapt.
River flooding on the urban environment: to reduce the flooding associated with extreme events and improve the ecological status of water bodies and the sustainable use of this resource.
Pluvial flooding on the urban environment: guaranteeing the city/territorial and urban functionality by increasing the resilience of drainage infrastructures and sustainable territorial planning.
Heat waves on the health of the population: ensuring thermal comfort and access to comfort zones during extreme temperature episodes.
Extreme winds on urban, rural and population health: improving knowledge on climate change scenarios of extreme winds.

In total, the SECAP 2030 includes 100 actions in 13 strategic areas for energy transition, mitigation and adaptation to climate change in the municipality.

+ 2020-2022: Development of the Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 Urban Agenda. Work has been carried out since 2020 on a new municipal governance framework and a methodology to design and assess urban policies, with the aim of developing, approving and implementing the Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 Urban Agenda (AU2030VG) and its corresponding action plan, which was approved on 9 September 2022, with the aim of making progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) both locally and globally.

Strong political leadership is vital for policies and strategies to be successful in terms of sustainability, climate change, and most importantly, continuity over time. Therefore, political consensus has been prioritised by Vitoria-Gasteiz over the years. The following agreements demonstrate the city's unanimous political commitment to sustainability and fighting climate change.

+ 2019: Approval by the Plenary Session of the Vitoria-Gasteiz City Council (27-09-2019) of the Motion of the Ekologistak Martxan Araba Association, on declaring a climate emergency in which the Vitoria-Gasteiz City Council undertook to determine the political commitments, regulations and resources necessary to reduce GHG emissions to reach a net zero balance by no later than 2040 and if possible before 2035.

+ 2021: Institutional declaration in favour of the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda. The Plenary of the City Council of Vitoria-Gasteiz made an institutional declaration in favour of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, approved in the XII plenary session of the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces (FEMP), and adherence to the Network of Local Entities to develop the SDGs outlined by the UN 2030 Agenda.

+ 2022: Institutional Declaration of Support for decarbonisation of the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz within the framework of the European Missions on climate-neutral and smart cities and adaptation to climate change. The Vitoria-Gasteiz Urban Agenda 2030 incorporates the European missions on Smart and Climate-Neutral Cities and Adaptation to Climate Change as levers for environmental, economic and social transformation, leaving no one behind.

With this institutional declaration, all the political groups supported Vitoria-Gasteiz's participation in the European Missions on 100 Smart and Climate Neutral Cities in 2030 and Adaptation to Climate Change. Furthermore, they recognised this participation "as a shared responsibility" which they undertook "to address and respond with the leadership, means and resources it deserves".

These missions are an opportunity to accelerate the processes of decarbonisation and local adaptation to climate change that Vitoria-Gasteiz has already planned, using the

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

Vitoria-Gasteiz Sustainable Climate and Energy Action Plan (SECAPVG2030) as its main tool. This declaration committed all political groups to revising the SECAP 2030, "as stated in the plan itself, aiming for climate neutrality by 2030". In fact, the first Climate Action Plan attached to this initial iteration of City Climate Contract already incorporates actions that will accelerate decarbonisation from the emissions reduction target set in the SECAP 2030 (61.5%) to 82%.

+ 2022: Institutional Declaration of Support for the Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 Urban Agenda (AU2030VG) - Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 Strategy. Through an Institutional Declaration, the Municipal Corporation of Vitoria-Gasteiz unanimously showed its support for the Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 Urban Agenda (AU2030VG) "to meet the Sustainable Development Goals in the city and its neighbouring towns so that no one is left behind in a sustainable environment where we continue to work as a society".

However, the goal of climate neutrality is not only a goal for the city, but also a challenge at regional, state, European and global level.

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

The European Commission's launch of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by 2030, called the Cities Mission, in November 2021, represents a unique opportunity for the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz.

Thus, the city's motivation for joining the Mission is as follows:

Vitoria-Gasteiz wants to continue moving towards climate neutrality and remain at the forefront of these policies, as it has demonstrated over the past three decades. Furthermore, our city is convinced that the Cities Mission is the very tool that will help us to achieve these objectives. This Mission will accelerate the processes that our city already has in place, scale up previous pilot projects to cover the whole city, and close the remaining gap to attain climate neutrality by 2030 through innovative ideas and transformative projects. All of this will be followed up in subsequent iterations of this City Climate Contract. This Mission also guarantees that Vitoria-Gasteiz will act as a centre for experimentation and innovation regarding new solutions that can then be scaled and transferred to other Basque, Spanish and European cities.

All of this aims to improve the lives of our citizens without leaving anyone behind and contribute locally to achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

All our action on climate change neutrality and adaptation is and will be aligned with European, estate and regional policies and regulations on energy transition, the circular economy and fighting climate change.

At European level, the European Commission has launched the NetZeroCities Platform as a core tool to support and assist European cities, providing them with the backing and solutions they need to break down current structural, institutional and cultural barriers to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

Nationally, the National Platform of Climate Neutral Cities (citiES2030) provides us with support, coordination, support and a shared space where the 7 Spanish cities in the mission, plus other cities in Spain, can work together, share and contrast experiences and knowledge, to achieve our goal of climate neutrality by 2030.

With all this support, and more, we would like to work on all those transversal levers where innovation is key to achieving our objectives, such as governance, regulatory sandboxes, data or social participation.

# Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

The city of Vitoria-Gasteiz aspires to be climate neutral by 2030. To this end, it is working from a Climate and Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SECAP 2030).

For 2030, in relation to the base year of 2006, the Comprehensive Energy Transition Plan (PATEI 2021-2030), within the SECAP 2030 for Vitoria-Gasteiz sets a direct GHG emissions reduction target of 61.5% (Scope 1 and 2) and a net GHG emissions reduction target of 83%. This plan also intends that the entire municipality should achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

The urban sectors associated with these GHG emissions are:

+ residential, tertiary and institutional construction
+ internal mobility of passengers and goods (both private and public)
+ provision of municipal services (public lighting, management of the water cycle, waste management, etc.)
+ the primary sector (agriculture and livestock).

Secondly, SECAP 2030, and the climate ambition associated with it, have been reviewed based on the new target set by the Mission and the results of the Economic Model carried out by Material Economics, firstly to reveal the existing gaps in the transport, buildings and heating, electricity and waste sectors, to achieve climate neutrality in 2030 for the whole city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, and secondly to plan, develop and accelerate the actions required to achieve that neutrality.

All this work is the beginning of the iterative construction process of construction that is taking place within the framework of the City Climate Contract. In other words, all the results obtained in this first iteration will be reviewed and updated in subsequent iterations.

This following conclusions were drawn from this first version:

According to the results of the Economic Model, in the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, the projection of GHG emissions to 2030 is practically the same level of emissions as produced in 2019 (which has been considered the reference year for the economic model).

The sectors with the greatest impact on overall emissions are electricity generation (35%) and building and the built environment (25%), followed by internal mobility (16%) and waste management (2%). However, there are two sectors not included in the model (industry and

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz
2

primary sector) which account for the remaining 22%. All these sectors will be included in the city's climate neutrality target.

The Economic Model resulting from the implementation of the Climate Action Plan proposed in this first iteration of our City Climate Contract estimates a reduction of GHG emissions in scopes 1 and 2 for the 4 sectors considered in it (and scope 3 for waste management) of 82%, with significant reductions in all of them. The sectors outside the model will also have to reduce their emissions by the same percentage, in order to achieve an overall reduction of 82%.

The Economic Model uses a Business As Usual (BAU2030) scenario as a reference to estimate the potential emission reductions through various decarbonisation strategies and actions. The BAU2030 scenario provides a baseline against which to compare the cost-effectiveness of these decarbonisation strategies and actions. This Economic Model estimates the incremental cost of the set of decarbonisation actions in the sectors addressed by the model. By comparing the costs and benefits of the different decarbonisation pathways against this scenario, the Economic Model can estimate the potential ROI (Return on Investment) of each strategy and action, identifying the most cost-effective pathways to attain the emission reduction target while ensuring the best cost-benefit ratio.

At this point, it is relevant to note that, although a high initial investment is required in 2030, the accumulated savings and co-benefits in 2050 represent an estimated return on investment (ROI) of 43% (not to mention the increase in property values for the owners of the buildings). In addition, the industrial sector and other sectors not included in the levers considered by the Economic Model will work closely with the institutions on their own decarbonisation. The aim is to achieve a reduction in these sectors that will bring down figures across all emitting sectors to 82% by 2030.

The entire city of Vitoria-Gasteiz aspires to achieve zero net GHG emissions by 2030 with estimated residual emissions for that year of less than 20%. Therefore, this Climate Contract and the associated Action Plans will be reviewed every two years to meet this goal.

For residual emissions, a CO₂ absorption strategy is envisaged, broadly based on Nature Based Solutions (NBS), reforestation and regenerative agriculture.

In addition, successive iterations of the Climate Contract will consider seeking help from platforms such as NetZeroCities, CitiES2030 and others to address Scope 3 emissions.

Achieving this climate neutrality goal by 2030 is not a stand-alone objective but connected to a series of other objectives and co-benefits for the city, such as improving citizens' health,

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz
3

improving air quality, promoting sustainable growth, creating green jobs, improving public spaces and housing comfort, reducing the use of raw materials and waste generation, minimising environmental impacts and climate change and halting the loss of biodiversity.

This makes it possible to identify the people, groups and agents who will benefit from the Mission, such as:

+ Residents of the municipality and visitors
+ Children, young people and the elderly
+ Collectives with health problems (respiratory, cardiovascular, mental health, etc.).
+ Businesses and entrepreneurs related to the green economy and ecological transition
+ Farmers, producers and local trade
+ Active and sustainable mobility user groups

Other sectors that can benefit include ecosystem services, the health system, employment, the productive fabric and the city's innovation ecosystem.

It goes without saying that this must be a **fair transition**, attempting to improve the lives of our citizens **without leaving anyone behind** and contributing from the local level to achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Thus, **the concept of climate neutrality** targeted by the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz within the framework of the Cities Mission of Cities goes beyond reducing our GHG emissions. It is an objective that implies systemic transformation towards environmental, economic and social sustainability.

Moreover, the current climate emergency situation does not give us any room to deviate from these objectives; climate change is a reality that is just dawning on us as we suffer the consequences in our cities. The energy crisis resulting from the complicated international situation has a direct impact on our citizens' finances. The urgency of all this obliges us to set ambitious objectives and not to deviate from the our deadlines.

Finally, I would like to insist that **Vitoria-Gasteiz** aspires to be a carbon neutral, resilient and metabolically efficient and biodiverse city by 2030, and this has been endorsed by the entire Municipal Council through these aforementioned Institutional Declarations:

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

# Key priorities and strategic interventions

Based on the SECAP 2030 data and the results of the Economic Modelling, conducted by Material Economics for the first iteration in the development framework of this Climate City Contract, six key priorities or strategies have been identified that must be urgently addressed to meet the climate neutrality goal:

Comprehensive regeneration and eco-rehabilitation of the city's neighbourhoods
Energy generation from renewable sources and promoting Energy Communities.
Mobility and sustainable transport
Circularity of the local economic system
Green Infrastructure and carbon sinks
Intelligent data-driven management.

Within these 6 key strategies, and in this first iteration, some lines of action have already been implemented or planned in the SECAP 2030 which, due to the new climate neutrality goal, should not only be implemented immediately, but also accelerated. Other lines will require additional innovative actions and financing models, seeking necessary alliances and collaborations with the different local agents involved, as well as with agents from other territorial areas. Through the successive iterations of this Climate Contract, these lines of action will have to be contrasted, modified and updated.

Some cross-cutting priority elements are also common to all lines such as:

+ Governance
+ Regulation
+ Funding
+ Social communication

where a systematic review will be necessary for successive iterations of this Climate City Contract, to be used as an efficient lever for the targeted systemic change.

These strategic lines are explained below with some specific examples of action areas, which should be accelerated in same cases and new innovative actions included in others.

# Comprehensive regeneration and eco-rehabilitation of neighbourhoods

The aim is to carry out urban, social and environmental regeneration with the following objectives:

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz
Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

+ Improve the energy efficiency of residential and tertiary buildings, including publicly-owned buildings.
+ Improve universal accessibility and sustainable mobility.
+ Connecting households to a high-speed digital network.
+ Connect households and commercial premises to a city-wide decarbonised district heating network.
+ Improve public space with the introduction of green infrastructure (and other actions, e.g. accessibility).
+ Generate low- or zero-emission urban developments and building sites.

Two Mission pilot projects were launched immediately:

+ The urban regeneration, eco-rehabilitation and vitalisation project for the Zaramaga neighbourhood (AD) in Vitoria-Gasteiz, which incorporates all the aforementioned action areas in a single neighbourhood, with resident-participation from the outset. Depending on the results, the project will be scaled up to other neighbourhoods in the city with similar characteristics. This project includes work to be carried out in Vitoria-Gasteiz in the multi-city project: Multi-stakeholder innovative &amp; systemic solutions for urban regeneration: Spain, which has been selected by the Mission's NetZeroCities Pilot Cities Programme (NZC-H2020-202209).
+ The Ensanche - Eco-Entrepreneurial District project to transform the city centre and work together to recover its identity through Vitoria-Gasteiz's three main strengths: our identity as a sustainable and ecologically responsible city, our hallmark as an industrial and service city and our great potential as a university and knowledge city. This project has been co-created with the citizens and conceived according to the New European Bauhaus values.

Success of these pilot projects could really accelerate the city's progress towards climate neutrality.

Within the scope of action targeting a decarbonised thermal network for the city as a whole, a process has been initiated to assess the technical and economic-financial feasibility, as well as its social acceptance, as a preliminary phase to subsequently define and develop it. Future iterations of this Climate Contract will specify the final model of this decarbonised network.

## Generation of energy from renewable sources and promotion of Energy Communities

This strategic line of work includes the following areas of action:

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz
Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

+ Public, private and public-private and public-private thermal and electrical power generation.
+ Deployment of renewable energy generation projects in municipal buildings and public spaces, mainly based on photovoltaic solar energy, targeting self-consumption.
+ Installation of photovoltaic solar energy in residential, tertiary and industrial buildings.
+ Promoting the creation of Energy Communities in both urban and rural areas.
+ Tackling fuel poverty through the developing programmes and support schemes for vulnerable groups and encouraging the use of alternative financing systems (e.g. through energy communities or crowdfunding).

We are currently working on a community energy initiative as co-creation with citizens regarding an energy project in the rural area of the municipality to define a renewable thermal energy community that uses local resources (forestry and agricultural waste). Once this project has been consolidated, it will be scalable to other rural areas of the municipality. All of this will be incorporated into successive iterations of this Climate City Contract.

## Mobility and sustainable transport

The aim is to transform and decarbonise the city's mobility system through:

+ producing a new sustainable mobility model which promotes active mobility and an electrified public transport system.
+ developing the superblocks model and implementing traffic calming zones
+ extending pedestrian and cycling networks, and expanding the public transport network
+ reformulating the regulated parking zone
+ promoting electrification of mobility (private and public, passenger and freight)
+ promoting the use of efficient driving techniques.

Ongoing and future interventions will help to reinforce this change. The implementation of eBRT (electric Bus Rapid Transit) in 2022 has saved 1,520 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2\mathrm{e}}$/year. The extension of the tramway in 2023 will also make a significant reduction in the use of private vehicles. Other interventions include creating a low emission zone (LEZ) in the city centre (2023), installing deterrent systems for private vehicles (charging systems, etc.) (2023) and the constructing a last-mile hub for cargo bikes (2024).

In turn, the Economic Model has identified that improving urban logistics is a key factor in both its contribution to GHG emissions and its potential to reduce GHG emissions. Many factors prevent good efficiency and sustainability in last-mile logistics, including lower average

7
Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

speeds, more stops and vehicle inactivity time, longer idling time, unsuccessful deliveries, collection of parcels for return, etc., which ultimately lead to higher fuel consumption and emissions.

In this sense, to accelerate this strategic line, the Climate Action Plan will incorporate collaborative initiatives with the Logistics Sector to optimise it, such as making routes more efficient by using advanced route optimisation software, capable of considerably reducing delivery times, changing the fleet of combustion vehicles for emission-free vehicles, whether electric or conventional bicycles, or even in the future for new modes of delivery (drones or autonomous delivery vehicles). Centralising deliveries at common access points such as ticket offices or warehouses could be another action to significantly reduce the number of trips by motorised vehicles. A service open to the public is already being implemented in the city centre as part of a pilot project to deliver parcels to smart mailboxes managed by a bicycle delivery cooperative.

# Circularity of the local economic system

## Circularity of the production system

The objective is to progressively modify the urban economic-productive system from the currently prevailing linear economic model to a circular model, which keeps materials in circulation indefinitely, obtains the highest possible value before and after disposal, and prioritises the sustainable use of resources through the transition to renewable energies, among other possibilities.

+ Boosting the circular transition of economic sector: transition of sectors to the circular economy will involve a change in the production model for the industry and services sectors, based on servitisation, eco-design, introducing new reused materials, minimising consumption of raw materials, etc. The sectors will have two major drivers: legislation and consumption. The capacity to adapt to this new scenario will not be the same for all companies and sectors. The public sector will seek to support other sectors to avoid gaps forming between them, and the necessary public-private alliances will be sought to develop the new economic model.

+ Promoting circular entrepreneurship: the productive transformation that will bring about transition for the economy from a linear model to a more circular model will be an opportunity to generate new businesses. The municipal actions to be promoted will include supporting these new business models, both in terms of entrepreneurship and intra-entrepreneurship.

+ New Basque Circular Hub headquarters in Vitoria-Gasteiz: the Basque Circular Hubs are a benchmark in southern Europe, unique due to the type of services they offer, encompassing market foresight, advanced training, trend analysis and generating expert knowledge in the field of the circular economy. This new Hub in Vitoria-Gasteiz will promote the development of technical circular economy projects in Alava’s business world with the participation from young professionals trained in the Hub itself. In addition, companies in Alava will have young specialists with the right knowledge to bring the circular economy into their processes. The services provided by the Hub will match the Mission’s goals.

## Municipal waste management

The Urban Waste Prevention and Management Plan (2016-2030) consider the current situation, and a series of objectives and measures has been planned to prevent generating waste (reduction of more than 15% in weight on 2016), preparing the generated waste for reuse and recycling (reaching at least 60% of total waste by weight), and the reduction of waste sent to landfill (below 15%), to substantially improve current ratios and significantly help reduce emissions. Within this framework, a number of projects are already underway:

+ New bulky waste collection service with a circular economy approach, provided by a third sector company that collects, sorts, prepares for reuse and markets the bulky waste collected, and offers a door-to-door collection. The service targets efficient collection, keeping material on the public highway for as little time as possible, to avoid deterioration, and to improve reuse and recycling rates. In addition, a shop has been set up selling decoration, furniture, toys and other reused products at affordable prices, obtained through this service and which have passed quality standards for sale.

+ The Konpondu project seeks to promote a change in the current consumption model of citizens in an attempt to extend the useful life of products through the local repair sector. Konpondu is a search engine for repair shops on the municipal website, featuring professionals who repair consumer products ranging from large and small household appliances to clothing and footwear, image and sound equipment, furniture, etc., as well as information and documentation related to repair and the circular economy.

+ Reutilizagune is a service for individuals regarding the reuse and second life of electrical and electronic appliances, household appliances, toys, furniture, computer, sports and children's equipment in use and books, novels, encyclopaedias or textbooks, all in good condition. These appliances and household goods are stored for a full week before being uploaded to the corresponding website.

+ Collection of used vegetable oil by containerisation on the public highway.

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

+ Recycling of organic matter through:
a new collection system with individualised access which identifies users by reading their citizen card and electronic chip.
home and community composting. The Composta (Reduce, Recycle, Compost) project provides citizens with the necessary resources to carry out composting (materials, training, follow-up visits and continuous advice via telephone and email).

# Vitoria-Gasteiz Circularity Strategy 2030

A local Circularity Strategy 2030 and an initial action plan with a 4-years time frame (2023-2026) are currently being developed. Its planning scope covers materials and waste linked in one way or another to all sectors of the city (imports, exports, generation, etc.), and its general objective is to make local economic activities more competitive in terms of the circular economy. Initially, 3 lines of action have been established: (1) Promotion and development of the circular industrial, construction, services, commerce and hotel and catering sectors; (2) Promotion of a responsible consumption model among citizens; (3) Development of efficient waste collection and management services that allow high levels of recycling.

This strategy will match the Mission’s goals, and may lead to tackling the reduction of Scope-3 emissions, an area in which Vitoria-Gasteiz would also like to set an example.

There are two particularly relevant areas in the Mission, insofar as they are related to proposed or future actions to reduce and/or absorb emissions in the Climate Action Plan: on the one hand, construction and specially renovation of buildings and the circularity of the materials to be used, and on the other, measures to be applied in the primary sector in relation to food.

+ Circularity of building materials. Building renovation or other refurbishment and new construction is a key opportunity to apply circular economy and climate neutrality criteria in the construction sector: products that last longer, use of fewer natural resources, resource/material efficiency, design for maximum efficiency over the building lifetime, redesign of the building to be more modular and repairable, reuse of building materials, introduction of recycled or renewable materials, planning of demolitions, proper waste management, improved machinery and equipment maintenance, optimisation of construction operations, limitation of distance for transport of materials, creation of zero-emission construction sites by bringing in construction machinery powered by renewable energies, etc. At the moment, there are no contrasted data available on the metabolism of these materials in the municipality, so one line of work in the coming months will consist of obtaining, validating and

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz
1

contracting them. This work will seek support by drawing on the experience of the NetZeroCities consortium members.

+ Vitoria-Gasteiz Agri-food Strategy. The Vitoria-Gasteiz Agri-Food Strategy and its action plan (2017-2025) are going to be re-issued to provide a strategy built on a shared vision by the key agents from the production and distribution sector, plus an intersectoral and multi-actor action plan.

The assessment of "food flows in the city of VG" (2021) revealed that more than 95% of the unprocessed food consumed in the city came from outside the Basque Country. A similar situation applies to all materials. These plans estimate indirect emissions and implement actions that contribute to decarbonising both systems. Some of the studies-projects being developed to activate this systemic change are the aforementioned report on food flows in the city (2021-22), which aims to quantify the total quantities of unprocessed food consumed in the city and the proportion (%) of local products, the results of which will establish the baseline of the CO₂ footprint for its food system. At the same time, a study is being carried out to quantify carbon capture by the city's farmland. Finally, the Municipal Organic Farmers' Seedbed (Basaldea) has been set up, which aims to attract and settle new organic farmers in the city, helping to diversify and increase local production as well as providing a solution to the flooding problem in the area.

# Green Infrastructure and carbon sinks

Vitoria-Gasteiz's Urban Green Infrastructure is made up of the Green Belt, parks and gardens, tree-lined streets and squares, green sports areas, urban orchards, streams, central reservations and roundabouts, vacant plots and other less conventional elements such as façades and green roofs. The Vitoria-Gasteiz Urban Green Infrastructure Strategy is being developed to improve the ecological, environmental and social functions of urban green spaces. This plan defines a system of main spaces on which to act, and a set of projects and interventions aiming to increase urban biodiversity (through naturalisation actions, creation of ponds and bird shelters...), improve water drainage (by laying permeable paving, creating rain gardens...), improve fixation of CO₂ and other atmospheric pollutants (through planting trees...), etc. Currently, the estimated carbon sequestration capacity of urban trees is 2,295 tonnes of CO₂/year. In addition, this green infrastructure will be promoted as an element that generates urban climate refuges, incorporating shade, evo-transpiration and permeable surfaces into this structure's planning and design.

The Green Belt (827 ha) is a semi-natural area comprising forests, rivers, wetlands, meadows, woodlands and hedgerows. It surrounds the urban centre and brings nature

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz
Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

closer to the city. It comprises more than 265,000 trees, a total leaf area of 12.11 km² and more than 12,000 tonnes of carbon stored in the plant tissue. In addition, its estimated carbon sequestration capacity is 3,168 tonnes of CO₂/year and removes 564 tonnes of air pollution (PM) (i-tree methodology, 2019). The aim is to incorporate new degraded areas and/or areas with great potential to act as carbon sinks in the peri-urban environment into the multifunctional Green Belt project, by generating new parks and agri-ecological spaces (Larragorri, Mendebaldea, Idiazabal Project, etc.).

Reissue of the Urban Tree Master Plan with the aim of highlighting the benefits of trees and turning them into a living heritage element of the city as well as a tool for the thermal regulation of public spaces and a carbon sink. This plan will include the appropriate planning, design and management strategies to achieve the objectives of the previous point.

Naturalisation of school playgrounds. The project seeks to turn outdoor spaces of educational centres to adapt them to climate change and incorporate them into the urban green infrastructure system, with the active participation of the educational community, incorporating the perspectives of coeducation, inclusion and sustainability as principles for intervention. It is specified in the following objectives:

Transform school playgrounds through Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for climate change adaptation in the context of climate policies and the green infrastructure strategy.
Create more inclusive spaces and opportunities to implement comprehensive educational projects in the Vitoria-Gasteiz Educating City context.
Improve social cohesion through community and social action projects and promote citizen participation.
As public service facilities, schools are an excellent laboratory for implementing innovative solutions and for disseminating and spreading practices to fight climate change and embrace the Mission's objectives.

+ Naturalisation of the Old Town: project to take steps to naturalise the Old Town, firstly, by identifying spaces on public roads and in public and private heritage buildings where it is feasible to intervene and, secondly, by proposing green infrastructure interventions in the identified spaces. Possible actions include the planting of trees, climbing plants, landscaping, installation of flowerpots and planters, etc. The project aims to co-create and test mechanisms to enable public-private management of green infrastructure in public spaces.

2
Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

All this will require coordination and civil responsibility mechanisms to enable public-private management of green infrastructure in the city's public space, allowing proliferation and diversification of green infrastructure on a micro scale by empowering citizens as key players in contributing to its generation and maintenance. One example of this is the Olarizu Botanical Garden, which has become a benchmark in botanical dissemination and the potential of green infrastructure as a driving force to activate citizens.

## Data-driven smart management

The Vitoria-Gasteiz City Council is committed to promoting smart data-based management by facilitating data sharing and transparency. To this end, it will use the city's Geographic Information System and the digital model built within the framework of the European SmartEnCity project for the city's Coronación neighbourhood. It will promote its use, extension and adaptation to enable the use of these digital tools in decision-making focussing on achieving climate neutrality.

In the future, the ultimate goal would be to set up a Digital Twin of Vitoria-Gasteiz, a virtual replica of the main elements of the municipality and its critical infrastructure, connected to databases and sensors, which will allow the analysis, modelling, simulation and prediction of scenarios, and develop hypotheses to support better decision-making processes.

It will also be necessary to work on a new innovative model of data governance and management, by setting up a "Data Office".

# Principles and process

Climate change is currently one of the humanity's main challenges, as a global problem that must nevertheless be fought on a local scale. Moving towards a climate-neutral city at an accelerated pace is also a huge challenge that must be embraced by all urban agents and citizens.

As the closest level of government to the city, local governments have the powers to address the urban areas that cause the most significant environmental impacts, affecting aspects as wide-ranging as urban planning, mobility, environmental protection, consumption, etc., therefore playing a key role in the energy transition and in the fight to reduce the vulnerability to the different consequences of climate change in their territory.

Building a solid mandate to govern the process that will lead us towards climate neutrality, requires collaboration and coordination between the different areas of the Vitoria-Gasteiz City Council (AVG) and other institutional levels, as well as the intense collaboration and participation of citizens and different stakeholders in a collaborative co-creation process. To achieve effective participation, commitment and co-responsibility of all of them, seeking intersectionality, collaboration and support from entities with experience in developing social innovation processes will be promoted with the aim of breaking down current barriers in the city's participatory processes. Likewise, intervention strategies will be developed for vulnerable groups that promote participatory awareness-raising (awareness of individual and social rights and duties in the light of climate change), training, learning and developing values, skills and necessary abilities (active listening, free expression, cooperation and teamwork), and that promote spaces and opportunities for participation (working in their networks and organisations) for these groups.

This will enable a robust, inclusive and systemic governance system to be set up, based on co-creation and focused on implementation and experimentation. A system based on multi-stakeholder collaboration, multi-level governance and distributed leadership.

The multi-stakeholder collaboration will involve creating a Multi-level and Multi-stakeholder Platform. A space created to contrast strategies, cooperate in the implementation and creation of actions, and share experiences in relation to the goal of achieving climate neutrality. All relevant agents in the city will be represented on this platform, referencing the quintuple helix model (public sector, private sector, academia and technology centres, civil society and citizenship and media) encompassing at least the following areas:

+ Institutional at all administrative levels (technical and political)

Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz
Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

+ Economic and financial sector
+ Universities, Technological Centres, Innovation Centres
+ Social sector (organised and unorganised citizens)
+ Education, culture, sports, etc.
+ Media
+ City Networks

Successive iterations of this Climate City Contract, which will be issued at least every two years, and by seeking the necessary support to implement it, will develop how the various stakeholders will interact and engage with the platform.

**Multilevel governance** is reflected in this system including all institutional levels that are directly or indirectly involved. In our case, this political governance must firstly integrate the regional (Basque Government), provincial (County Council of Alava) and local (Vitoria-Gasteiz City Council and representation of the Municipal Councils) institutions, and secondly, all public entities with a purpose related to the climate neutrality goal in some way. Finally, all this political governance must also be connected with institutions at state and European level in order to give the project the character of a global challenge that it possesses.

The **first iteration of the Climate City Contract** propose to work on models of Documents of Adhesion to the Climate Contract, with the different levels of institutional governance (Autonomous Community, Historical Territory, etc.) and with the different agents from the relevant sectors of the municipality (economic, financial, educational, research centres, media, cultural, society, etc.), where both parties compile and sign their commitments to the Mission’s objective. The models are currently being worked on and future iterations intend to incorporate adhesions from the various stakeholders. This will require working on new innovative forms of participation and governance, for which we will have to seek the necessary support and assistance.

Furthermore, this important challenge posed by the Cities Mission requires **distributed leadership**. This leadership is organised internally through the structure created to develop and implement the Vitoria-Gasteiz 2030 Urban Agenda (AU2030VG), as the European Missions in which the city participates are among the cross-cutting levers to be activated to meet the challenges it sets for the city.

Firstly, the AVG has assigned the responsibility for the technical coordination of the developing the SECAP 2030 and the AU2030VG to the Sustainability, Climate and Energy Service, which is part of the Territory and Climate Action Department. This service is therefore responsible for promoting the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and the AU2030VG with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in the city. It will also work as an interdepartmental facilitator,

5
Climate City Contract - Vitoria-Gasteiz

acting as a municipal node to deploy the AU2030VG and the SECAP 2030, ensuring an adequate and integrated governance scheme.

To generate the systemic change that will drive the Mission, this coordination is supported by the Climate Missions Coordination Team, made up of people from various municipal departments, municipal companies and political coordination, all this integrated and supported by the Area of Territory and Climate Action, Mobility and Public Space. From this team, governance is distributed into 5 main areas of leadership: general coordination, technical-administrative, networks, agents and policy.

This whole new governance system will be responsible for developing successive iterations of the Climate City Contract, co-designing the portfolio of new and/or accelerating actions and interventions that will be needed to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. These iterations will be one of the tools used to monitor the proposed actions and interventions and the impacts generated through their implementation.

Externally, to coordinate distributed leadership, a space/platform will be set up through which the different agents involved will be able to lead and coordinate their respective sectors of action. Support, collaboration and coordination will be sought to set up and develop this space/platform with the Spanish Cities Platform for Climate Neutrality CitiES2030 and with the NetZeroCities Mission platform.

Finally, the need to set up a Climate Neutrality Office is being assessed, to bring together, coordinate and offer technical support to both the political governance and the technical-administrative and socio-economic governance of the two European Climate Missions - Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission and Adaptation to Climate Change Mission- in which Vitoria-Gasteiz is participating. All this will be developed and specified in the successive iterations of the Climate City Contract.

Implementation of this new governance system will give us a common goal with a shared vision of the Vitoria-Gasteiz we want in 2030. It will help us to generate ownership of the process among all stakeholders in our society, develop new avenues for collaboration, drive and reward commitments and connect, share and celebrate our successes with other communities.

The complete diagram of the governance initially designed for the Vitoria-Gasteiz City Mission and Adaptation Mission is shown below.

Future iterations will work on the coordination, interaction and engagement model between the multi-stakeholder space/platform, the climate neutrality office and the involvement of the different agents from the 5 defined areas.

# Declaración de apoyo del Gobierno a la neutralidad climática de las ciudades Misión españolas

Dejo constancia del compromiso de apoyo del Gobierno de España a los “acuerdos de neutralidad climática” presentados por las ciudades seleccionadas por la Comisión Europea el 28 de abril de 2022 para participar en la Misión Europea de Ciudades: Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza, Valladolid y Vitoria-Gasteiz.

Este apoyo, para contribuir a la transformación ecológica y energética de las ciudades y a una mayor resiliencia climática y social, se materializa en el marco de las competencias del Estado, entre otros, en los siguientes aspectos:

El impulso de un marco regulatorio alineado con la innovación sistémica y la colaboración público-privada que requiere la Misión Europea de Ciudades. En este contexto, destaca:

+ La Agenda Urbana Española, aprobada en febrero de 2019, que pone de manifiesto la necesidad de lograr la sostenibilidad en las políticas de desarrollo urbano. Se constituye como un método de trabajo y un proceso para todos los actores que intervienen en las ciudades y que aspiran a un desarrollo equitativo, justo y sostenible desde los distintos campos de actuación. Esta estrategia se desarrolla en torno a 30 objetivos específicos y 291 líneas de actuación, que incluye a todos los pueblos y ciudades con independencia de tamaño y población, y aborda la sostenibilidad económica, social y medio ambiental.

+ La Ley 7/2021, de 20 de mayo, de cambio climático y transición energética. Marco institucional que garantiza, a través de sus distintas medidas, la coordinación de las políticas sectoriales, asegurando coherencia entre ellas y sinergias para alcanzar el objetivo de la neutralidad climática y aumentar
2

nuestra capacidad de adaptación ante los efectos adversos del cambio climático.

El compromiso de trabajar en los desarrollos reglamentarios de la Ley es claro. Por las implicaciones que tiene para la Misión de ciudades, se destacan los siguientes: i) en el ámbito energético, se trabaja en el establecimiento de un marco para desplegar eficiencia energética en industrias y edificios y las energías renovables como vectores hacia la descarbonización, ii) en materia de movilidad sin emisiones, se recoge el mandato a las ciudades para que adopten planes de movilidad urbana sostenible con medidas de mitigación, como las zonas de bajas emisiones, iii) en materia de contratación verde, se trabaja para establecer medidas que integren la lucha contra el cambio climático en los procedimientos de contratación pública, como son la inclusión como prescripciones técnicas particulares en los pliegos de contratación de criterios de reducción de emisiones y de huella de carbono dirigidos específicamente a la lucha contra el cambio climático.

La puesta en marcha de la Plataforma de Colaboración para la Neutralidad Climática de las Ciudades Españolas (citiES 2030), una herramienta creada ad hoc y ya en funcionamiento para facilitar la implementación de la Misión de Ciudades.

El Gobierno de España, con la implementación de esta plataforma, no solo permite dar cumplimiento a una de las actividades iniciales de la Misión, sino que se convierte en referente para los demás países y ciudades del programa.

Esta plataforma es una infraestructura de innovación y colaboración multiactor para apoyar y acelerar la transformación de las ciudades españolas hacia la neutralidad climática.

La plataforma tiene como principales beneficiarios a los Ayuntamientos de las ciudades españolas de más de 50.000 habitantes o capitales de provincia que tengan la voluntad de alcanzar la neutralidad climática total o parcialmente en 2030, así como a las ciudades de más de 20.000 habitantes que quieran iniciar este proceso.
3

La plataforma ofrece a las ciudades una serie de servicios, entre los que destacan:

+ la formación, aprendizaje y fortalecimiento de capacidades;
+ el apoyo al desarrollo de plataformas de innovación sistémica locales para el diseño de carteras de proyectos transformadores;
+ la asistencia para la redacción y seguimiento de los acuerdos climáticos de ciudad y el diseño de hojas de ruta en un entorno multiactor;
+ la conexión con procesos similares en otras ciudades europeas; la incubación de proyectos multiciudad; la participación y activación ciudadana;
+ la asistencia a las ciudades para la estructuración de planes de financiación de la transformación, involucrando a actores del ámbito financiero; y
+ la comunicación estratégica.

La gobernanza de la Plataforma es multiactor y multinivel, con el objetivo de facilitar, ordenar y garantizar direccionalidad y estabilidad en estas colaboraciones. De esta manera, cuenta con la participación de los actores de la quíntuple hélice:

+ sector público (administraciones y agencias públicas).
+ sector privado (empresas, sector financiero, sector de infraestructuras urbanas y asociaciones profesionales).
+ academia (universidades y centros de investigación).
+ sociedad civil (ONGs y asociaciones de vecinos).
+ medios de comunicación.

El apoyo a la movilización de inversiones verdes. Un buen ejemplo es el despliegue del Plan de Recuperación, Transformación y Resiliencia a través de la movilización de un volumen de inversión sin precedentes que prioriza no sólo paliar los efectos de la crisis, sino también la transformación de nuestro país hacia una economía sostenible e inclusiva.

El Plan reconoce el papel fundamental de las ciudades en la transformación económica y social, por su capacidad de generar actividad a corto plazo con efecto tractor sobre la industria y sectores clave, y su importancia frente a la emergencia climática. Así, se recogen de iniciativas destinadas a aspectos esenciales para la neutralidad climática de las ciudades como:

+ La mejora de la movilidad sostenible, con el impulso del vehículo eléctrico y de pila de combustible y la extensión de las infraestructuras de recarga, a través de los diferentes programas MOVES.

+ El impulso de la rehabilitación de los entornos residenciales urbanos, viviendas, edificios y barrios, con el objetivo prioritario de reducir en consumo energético e impulsar la descarbonización en el parque residencial.

+ El desarrollo de comunidades energéticas, que impulsen la innovación social y la participación ciudadana en renovables, eficiencia energética o movilidad eléctrica, contribuyendo con ello a una descarbonización justa e inclusiva en ámbitos urbanos.

+ El impulso del autoconsumo para el aprovechamiento energético de los tejados y cubiertas urbanos, el almacenamiento detrás del contador y la climatización renovable en hogares.

+ El desarrollo de estrategias e iniciativas transformadoras de renaturalización urbana, favoreciendo el incremento de la infraestructura verde y la biodiversidad en ciudades españolas y favoreciendo las Soluciones Basadas en la Naturaleza para dar respuesta a sus desafíos socioambientales.
5

+ El apoyo a la implementación de la normativa de residuos, en colaboración con las CCAA y las ciudades, y con inversiones en digitalización en materia de gestión ambiental, a través del PRTR.

+ El despliegue de convocatorias de ayudas a municipios y entidades locales para la implantación en las ciudades de zonas de bajas emisiones y la transformación sostenible y digital del transporte urbano.

El seguimiento de los avances del conjunto de las siete ciudades a través de la información procesada en la Plataforma de Colaboración citiES 2030, con el objetivo de integrar la hoja de ruta de transformación urbana en el conjunto del proceso de descarbonización del país.

En el marco del proceso iterativo de la Misión Europea de Ciudades, el Gobierno participará en el seguimiento y actualización de los compromisos asumidos en las declaraciones de neutralidad climática de las ciudades de Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz y Zaragoza, apoyando el reconocimiento y divulgación de los avances alcanzados.

# Supporting statement of National Government for the climate neutrality of Spanish Mission Cities

I hereby place on record the Spanish Government's commitment to support the climate city contracts presented by the cities, which were selected by the European Commission on 28 April 2022 to participate in the European Cities Mission: Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza, Valladolid and Vitoria-Gasteiz.

This support contributes to the ecological and energy transformation of cities and to a greater climate and social resilience, which is materialised in the Spanish State's framework of competences, among others, in the following aspects:

The impulse of a regulatory framework aligned with the systemic innovation and public-private collaboration required by the European Mission of Cities. In this context, it highlights:

+ The Spanish Urban Agenda, approved in February 2019, which highlights the need to achieve sustainability in urban development policies. It is constituted as a working method and a process for all the actors involved in cities that aspire to an equitable, fair and sustainable development from the different fields of action. This strategy is developed around 30 specific objectives and 291 action lines, which includes all villages and cities regardless of size and population, and it addresses economic, social and environmental sustainability.

+ Law 7/2021, of 20 May, on climate change and energy transition. This institutional framework guarantees, through its various measures, the coordination of sectoral policies, ensures coherence between them and synergies to achieve the objective of climate neutrality, and increases our capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
↑

The work commitment on the regulatory developments of the Law is clear. Due to the implications for the European Mission Cities, the following stand out: (i) in the energy field, work is being done to establish a framework to deploy energy efficiency in industries and buildings, and renewable energies as vectors towards decarbonisation, (ii) in terms of emission-free mobility, the mandate for cities to adopt sustainable urban mobility plans with mitigation measures, such as low-emission zones, is included, iii) in the area of green procurement, we are working to establish measures to integrate the fight against climate change in public procurement procedures, such as the inclusion of emission reduction and carbon footprint criteria specifically aimed at the fight against climate change as specific technical requirements in procurement specifications.

The launch of the Multi-stakeholder Collaboration Platform for the Climate Neutrality of Spanish Cities (citiES 2030), a tool created ad hoc and already in operation to facilitate the implementation of the Cities Mission.

With the implementation of this platform, the Government of Spain not only fulfils one of the initial activities of the Mission, but also becomes a reference for the other countries and cities in the programme.

This platform is a multi-stakeholder innovation and collaboration infrastructure to support and accelerate the transformation of Spanish cities towards climate neutrality.

The platform's main beneficiaries are city councils of Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants or provincial capitals that want to achieve full or partial climate neutrality by 2030, as well as cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants that want to initiate this process.

The platform offers cities a range of services, including:

+ Training, learning and skills enhancement
↑

+ The support for the development of local systemic innovation platforms for the design of transformative project portfolios;
+ The assistance in drafting and monitoring climate city contracts and the design of roadmaps in a multi-stakeholder environment;
+ The connection with related processes in other European cities; the incubation of multi-city projects; the citizen participation and activation;
+ The assistance to cities to structure transformation financing schemes, involving financial actors;
+ The strategic communication.

The Platform's governance is multi-stakeholder and multi-level, with the aim of facilitating, ordering and guaranteeing directionality and stability in these collaborations. In this way, it relies on the participation of the actors of the quintuple helix:

+ The public sector (administrations and public agencies).
+ The private sector (companies, financial sector, urban infrastructure sector and professional associations).
+ The academia (universities and research centres).
+ The civil society (NGOs and neighbourhood associations).
+ The media.
4

The support to mobilisation of green investments. A good example is the deployment of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan through the mobilisation of an unprecedented volume of investment that prioritises not only mitigating the effects of the crisis, but also the transformation of our country towards a sustainable and inclusive economy.

The Recovery Plan recognises the fundamental role of cities in economic and social transformation, due to their capacity to generate short-term activity with a pull effect on industry and key sectors, and their importance in terms of the climate emergency. Thus, it includes initiatives aimed at essential aspects for the climate neutrality of cities, such as:

+ The improvement of sustainable mobility, with the promotion of electric and fuel cell vehicles and the extension of recharging infrastructures, through the different MOVES programmes.
+ The promotion of the renovation of urban residential environments, housing, buildings and neighbourhoods, with the priority objective of decreasing energy consumption and promoting decarbonisation in the household stock.
+ The development of energy communities that promote social innovation and citizen participation in renewables, energy efficiency and electric mobility, thereby contributing to fair and inclusive decarbonisation in urban areas.
+ The promotion of self-consumption for the energy use of urban roofs and decks, storage behind the meter and renewable HVAC in homes.
+ The development of transformative strategies and initiatives for urban renaturalisation, helping to increase green infrastructure and biodiversity in Spanish cities and favouring Nature-Based Solutions to respond to their socio-environmental challenges.
+ The support for the implementation of waste regulation, in collaboration with the autonomous communities and cities, with investments in
5

digitalisation for environmental management, through the Recovery Plan.

+ The deployment of calls for grants to municipalities and local entities for the implementation of low-emission zones in cities and the sustainable and digital transformation of urban transport.

The monitoring of the progress of the seven cities through the information processed in the citiES 2030 Platform, with the aim of integrating the urban transformation roadmap into the country's decarbonisation process.

As part of the iterative process of the European Cities Mission, the Spanish Government will participate in the monitoring and updating of the commitments made in the climate neutrality agreements of the cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza, supporting the recognition and dissemination of the progress achieved.

VITORIA-GASTEIZ'S CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT 2030

ACCESSION DOCUMENT OF ... TO VITORIA-GASTEIZ'S CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT ON CLIMATE NEUTRALITY AND ADAPTATION WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF EU 100 CLIMATE NEUTRAL AND SMART CITIES AND ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE MISSIONS TO 2030

LOGO OF THE CITY AND OF THE SIGNATORY ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL SECTOR STAKEHOLDER HERE
I. PREAMBLE

Climate change is a critical global challenge that requires strong and ambitious joint action at all political, territorial, economic and social levels, given the current climate emergency situation that has been declared at international, European and national level, as well as by the Basque Parliament, the Basque Government and the City Council of Vitoria-Gasteiz.

Planet's protection through the sustainable management of its natural resources and the adoption of urgent measures in the face of the challenge of climate change is one of the basic pillars on which the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is built, in order to be able to meet the needs of present and future generations. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 - Climate Action, sets targets related to taking urgent action to combat climate change and its adverse effects, and to meet the objectives of the international Paris Agreement on this matter.

Precisely in order to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and to comply with the Paris Agreement, the European Union has adopted the European Green Deal, which includes a series of measures to achieve this goal.

In the framework of the European Green Deal, the European Commission has launched the European Missions as a pilot innovation of the research and innovation programme "Horizon Europe". In the area of climate change, the missions aim to prepare adequately for the achievement of the 2050 European targets set for the European Union as a whole, through learning from the experience of a selected number of European cities and regions that are part of these missions, where innovation efforts will be intensified to test, trial and demonstrate the feasibility of achieving climate neutrality and adaptation to climate resilience by 2030, i.e. 20 years ahead of the 2050 deadline. The European Commission plans to mobilise the financial, policy and regulatory instruments at its disposal to achieve its climate neutrality objectives, promoting active and sustained partnership between public and private actors, such as EU Member States, regional and local authorities, research institutes, businesses and investors, and citizens.

Vitoria-Gasteiz has been selected by the European Commission to take part in two of its missions, such as "100 Climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030 Mission" -known as the "Cities Mission"-, and the "Adaptation to Climate Change Mission" -known as the "Adaptation Mission"-, the mission in which the Basque Government has also been selected as part of the same, including the whole of the region.
The "Cities Mission" has a twofold objective: (i) to work towards making 100 European cities - and 12 cities in EU partner states - smart and carbon neutral by 2030, acting as innovation and experimentation ecosystems to achieve this goal; (ii) and to draw relevant lessons from the experience of the Mission cities to extend the learning to facilitate the transition to climate neutrality of other European cities by 2050.

The "Adaptation Mission" aims to help at least 150 regions and municipalities to accelerate their resilience to climate change by 2030, so that their experience and learning will facilitate adaptation to climate change in other territories.

The objectives of both missions to achieve climate neutrality and adaptation by 2030 are inspiring objectives and also the vision, which the City Council of Vitoria-Gasteiz has assumed as its own, to join the European challenge of accelerating the achievement of climate neutrality, in coherence with the consolidated trajectory and commitment of the city to environmental sustainability and its membership of the cities' network that have been recognised as Green Capital in the European Union. In addition, the large territorial extension of the municipality and its composition -urban, agricultural and forestry- represent an important potential for action in terms of adaptation.

Vitoria-Gasteiz's accession to the commitment to climate neutrality inexorably entails accelerating its climate action in the face of the challenges of greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation to climate change, intensifying the necessary efforts to this end, all in an environment of innovation and synergetic collaboration with all the stakeholders involved, as well as with the different territorial levels.

This municipal commitment has been endorsed by all the political groups of the council through the "Institutional Declaration of support for the decarbonisation of the municipality of Vitoria-Gasteiz within the framework of the European missions of carbon neutral cities and adaptation to climate change", approved unanimously, and with two essential tools to achieve climate neutrality by 2030: Sustainable Energy and Action Plan (SECAP) and Vitoria-Gasteiz's Urban 2030 Agenda (AU2030VG).

The fact that Vitoria-Gasteiz is one of the seven Spanish cities of the "Cities Mission" on which the European Commission has focused its attention and has considered it worthy of assuming and being capable of intensifying its efforts and acting as a pole of innovation and experimentation to achieve climate neutrality ahead of the global deadline set for 2050, also represents a challenge for the country, which transcends the city.

This challenge for the country is also linked to the role of the cities and regions of the climate missions to act as a lighthouse through the dissemination and replication of

8
lessons learnt from these innovative experiences in other cities, regions or territories, so that the challenge of climate neutrality in an advanced manner is also extended and shared in their surroundings.

Achieving the challenge of climate neutrality and adaptation in Vitoria-Gasteiz by 2030 as an integral part of the European missions requires, in any case, the participation of society as a whole, of all agents, of citizens and of the different institutional levels.

Specifically, climate missions require that their scope and content -based on the Sustainable Energy and Action Plan (SECAP) and the Vitoria-Gasteiz's Urban 2030 Agenda-, their governance and their deployment be set out in a document that takes the form of a climate city contract, in which all agents, citizens and the different institutional levels will have to participate.

Given the complexity of forming a climate city contract of these characteristics, due to the novelty that this entails and the large number of parties participating in it and its diverse nature, it has been considered appropriate that at the time of the start of the two climate missions - of climate neutral cities and adaptation - accession documents should be signed, ordered by the nature of the signatory parties, so that all of them, as a whole, make up the Vitoria-Gasteiz's Climate City Contract, which, in turn, revolves fundamentally around the roadmap towards climate neutrality in 2030 presented by Vitoria-Gasteiz in its candidacy for the mission of climate-neutral cities, and which resides in the Sustainable Energy and Action Plan (SECAP), adopted by the commitment made by the city within the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy of the European Union. Vitoria-Gasteiz's Climate City Contract will be, in short, an "Agreement of agreements".

The participation of the economic-financial agents in the Vitoria-Gasteiz Climate City Contract includes the signing of the accession document by: business organisations, which include small, medium-sized and large companies that form part of the business fabric of Vitoria-Gasteiz or that operate in it; self-employed workers; business clusters; professional associations; business organisations; trade union organisations; financial institutions; and any other economic agent interested in contributing to the effort to achieve climate neutrality in Vitoria-Gasteiz by 2030.

The ... (to be completed by THE FINANCIAL ECONOMIC SECTOR AGENT, maximum 5 paragraphs)

## II. NATURE AND SUBJECT

The subject of Vitoria-Gasteiz's Climate City Contract is to include the commitments of the signatory parties to achieve climate neutrality in Vitoria-Gasteiz by
, as well as to capitalise on the learning from the experience acquired and improve its replicability in other territories and fields of action.

The nature of Vitoria-Gasteiz's Climate City Contract is of a programmatic nature, and its signing does not produce any legal effect for the parties, nor any legal obligation for them.

The commitments contained in Vitoria-Gasteiz's Climate City Contract identify the initiatives that the signatory parties intend to carry out as measures to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

## III. CONTENT AND COMPOSITION

In addition to the commitments of the parties, Vitoria-Gasteiz's Climate City Contract includes the system of governance foreseen for its application and development, as well as an investment plan linked to it.

Vitoria-Gasteiz's Climate City Contract has no binding economic content for the parties. The investment plan indicates the necessary resources foreseen to achieve climate neutrality.

Vitoria-Gasteiz's Climate City Contract is made up of all the accession documents signed by the City Council for climate neutrality in 2030, forming a single "Agreement" as a whole.

## IV. COMMITMENTS OF VITORIA-GASTEIZ'S CITY COUNCIL

Vitoria-Gasteiz's City Council undertakes to work and intensify its efforts to achieve climate neutrality and its adaptation to climate change in the municipality by 2030.

Vitoria-Gasteiz's City Council commits to lead the city's transition to climate neutrality by 2030 in a participatory manner through the deployment of the city's Climate City Contract.
