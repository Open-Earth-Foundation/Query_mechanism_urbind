# Background to Lyon's climate strategy

## a) Legal framework and voluntary initiatives at city level in France

French regulations define “PCAET” (plans climat air-énergie-territorial) as mandatory planning tools, both strategic and operational, that enable public inter-municipal cooperation establishments with populations of over 20,000, i.e. which group together several towns, to address the whole range of air-energy-climate issues on their territory. In fact, it is these local authorities that bear many of the mandatory climate-related local policies (sustainable mobility, waste management, etc. - see Appendix 2).

In line with this legal framework, many French cities have launched voluntary initiatives to define climate strategies within their own boundaries, in order to go further and create stronger local dynamics in terms of climate and ecological transition: city-wide climate plan, adherence to international or national climate labels, creation of a network of local players on climate issues, Agenda 21, citizens' climate convention, etc.

To fully understand the City of Lyon's actions, one has to take into account the legal framework, and the City's ability and commitment to act beyond it.

## b) The City of Lyon's commitment to develop its own climate strategy in line with the metropolitan vision

In Lyon, the Metropolis is responsible for drawing up and implementing the PCAET. The Metropolis of Lyon comprises 59 communes spread out over 538 km², with very different realities: a highly urbanized central city (Lyon) with over 500,000 inhabitants, medium-sized towns sometimes adjoining Lyon, and small villages with 3,000 inhabitants.

The Metropolis' PCAET was drawn up with the aim to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

local stakeholders were involved in developing this document and agreed to commit to it (by signing it). However the PCAET does not adopt an explicit sub-territorial vision: on a specific objective or action, the plan does not give guidance as to how the 59 municipalities, according to their own context, can contribute or go beyond it. It is up to them to decide how they will implement these objectives and actions.

In 2013, the City of Lyon voluntarily drew up its first climate, air and energy plan, with a view to setting targets for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and implementing the objectives of the PCAET. This plan has since been updated and strengthened on several occasions, particularly in the field of adaptation. These successive plans, in which the City's departments were involved together with elected representatives, were very much focused on the City's competencies and included a portfolio of actions detailing the commitment of the City's departments.
c) Historically, a municipal climate strategy with little involvement from local partners and citizens

Lyon's first Climate, Air and Energy Plans did not include a focus on local stakeholders and citizens nor did they specify what role they could play in the implementation of actions taken by the Municipality. The scope of Lyon's Climate, Air and Energy Action Plans covered only the city in terms of "local authority" (the city's buildings, public services) and not the "territory".

Although the City's departments already worked together with a certain number of local stakeholders in implementing climate-related public policies, there was no shared vision or common, cross-functional strategy. For example, the governance of the climate plans did not involve external partners, with the exception of the local Energy and Climate Agency.

As regards citizens' involvement, the updating of the 2019 climate, air and energy plan made it possible to strengthen their participation. The City collected 4,400 contributions made by citizens through a digital consultation and organized 4 workshops based on the issues raised in these contributions.

## 2. Lyon 2030: a territorial approach

To meet the climate challenge, in January 2022 the City set itself the goal of achieving climate neutrality for its territory by 2030.

Achieving climate neutrality requires the City to step up its commitments on its assets and municipal public policies, thus by strengthening its Climate, Air and Energy Plan. In addition and in conjunction with the Metropole, this also means greater mobilisation and involvement of all local stakeholders - the city's economic, educational, social, cultural and sporting stakeholders, civil society organisations and other representatives of inhabitants, and public agencies - as well as, on a larger scale, of citizens.

The "Lyon 2030: inspiring change" approach launched by the City in 2022 is a response to these challenges, i.e. setting the City and stakeholders in motion by experimenting with new modes of governance and commitments on climate and ecological transition (see part 2, C of the Lyon 2030 climate contract).

### a) A new 2023-2030 Climate, Air and Energy Plan to meet the challenge of climate neutrality

With the election of a new executive in 2020 the City Council adopted stronger climate commitments. This made the revision of the municipal Climate, Air and Energy Plan necessary. Reviewing this strategic plan involved a large number of people within the City of Lyon, the Metropolis and beyond. A dialogue was initiated with local players involved in the Lyon 2030 initiative, and with the Metropolis' Scientific Council.

This new climate plan is not only an internal planning document. It was also designed as a lever for action to get Lyon's stakeholders on board and for the City and its partners to support them in the implementation of their climate commitments. This is already reflected in several actions carried out by the City: support to associations and eco-conditionality of subsidies granted to them, public purchasing that encourages best practices and structuring of innovative sectors, support to reduce the carbon impact of events and of the cultural sector.

The path towards climate neutrality by 2030 is structured around a set of thematic actions. The City's climate plan is flexible and adaptable, and will continue to be enriched and strengthened as the City
moves towards carbon neutrality. This iterative methodology will make it possible to take into account feedback from the field and the results of experiments, as well as improvements in the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions and therefore in the quantification of the impact of the actions undertaken.

## b) A new framework for climate governance, cooperation and action in Lyon

Lyon's application for the European 100 climate-neutral and intelligent cities program was built around the slogan "Lyon 2030: inspiring change". At the heart of this application was the City's desire to work with and mobilize local players more broadly, and also to better support the citizens' dynamic around climate and ecological transition. A committee of 80 local stakeholders supported Lyon's application to this European program.

At the heart of the Lyon 2030 approach is the creation of an Agora, a community of Lyon stakeholders ready to co-construct a shared vision for achieving climate neutrality by 2030 (see part 3 of the Lyon 2030 climate contract). The first Agora, set up in 2023, comprises sixty members that all volunteered to join the process. This assembly is destined to grow, but the collective formed in 2023 already includes major players in the city's various sectors (see Agora composition table at the end of this document).

In terms of achieving climate neutrality, the City's competencies are limited in many areas directly related to the ecological transition (see appendix 2). The starting point for the Agora's work was therefore not the actions carried out by the City, but rather:

the collective's vision of the challenges facing the Lyon region,
how to respond to them collectively,
and how the public authorities could contribute by suggesting proposals for action.

The Agora met five times in the first half of 2023. It worked on sobriety, an issue it considered a priority for meeting the climate challenge. As a result, the Agora agreed upon 16 commitments detailed in the "Lyon 2030 climate contract", along with 29 proposals for action targeted to public authorities. The Lyon 2030 climate contract is a living document, which will be enriched as the Agora's work progresses, with the ultimate aim of covering all climate neutrality issues.

In line with the collective vision set out in the Lyon 2030 climate contract, each Agora member is requested to draw up a cooperation and commitment agreement with the City. In these agreements members of the Agora are to write their commitments and the areas of cooperation with the municipality, adapted to their specific characteristics: their challenges, their capacity to act and their core business or action. Beyond sobriety, other priorities can be addressed.

# 3. Roadmap to climate neutrality

## a) Scenarios towards climate neutrality

The City has worked on three scenarios aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a territorial level (see Appendix 1):

A "baseline" scenario in which all municipal and metropolitan public policies, taking into account national policies and regulations, would be implemented, leading to a 40-45% reduction in emissions between 2019 and 2030;
A more ambitious scenario (called within the City "climate priority scenario") which identifies the areas in which the City of Lyon, either through its competences or through the Agora, has the means of action to accentuate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This scenario would lead to a 58% reduction between 2019 and 2030. This scenario focuses on actions mainly undertaken on the levers available to the City. That said, it is nonetheless dependent on the Metropolis, particularly in terms of the energy purchasing policy for district heating networks. It also depends on the commitment of every stakeholder within Lyon, as well as the financial support of the Government to boost buildings' renovation and sustainable mobility.
A highly ambitious scenario (called within the City as "climate neutrality scenario") which identifies the additional actions needed to reach as much as possible 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This scenario would lead to a 73% reduction in emissions between 2019 and 2030. It requires the involvement not only of the City itself, but also of all the other players in the city and beyond:

Citizens and businesses, to renovate buildings and to change mobility and consumption patterns. More broadly, concerned sectors (construction...) need to be in a position to keep up with the pace of renovation and change in mobility.
The Metropolis, to accelerate the development of district heating networks as well as the number of building connections to these networks, and to promote sustainable mobility;
The Government, to boost support to renovation of residential and tertiary buildings and the move towards more sustainable mobility. More broadly, to initiate a major change in laws and regulations at all levels in order to give full priority to climate issues;
Europe to go further, not only in terms of financial support, but also in terms of a real shift towards stricter climate regulations in all sectors and a drastic limitation in the use of fossil fuels.

To achieve this, climate action must become the number one priority for everyone involved.

## b) Action portfolio

The CCC action portfolio includes:

) Actions carried out by the City of Lyon within its perimeter, its competencies, according to its public policies and heritage, with the aim to strengthen partnerships with local players and citizen participation.

) Actions carried out by Agora members as part of their cooperation and commitment agreements, which may include :

a. Actions that apply solely to their scope of action;
b. Collective actions with other members of the Agora or other stakeholders;
c. Actions linked to the City's climate plan, for which the City could provide support, strengthen synergies, etc.

Methodology and consistency between CCC documents

## A systemic vision

Both the new Climate, Air and Energy Plan and the Lyon 2030 Climate Contract emphasize that climate neutrality cannot be achieved without taking into account planetary limits, sustainable development objectives and a profound rethinking of our lifestyles.

At municipal level, there was a consensus on the fact that actions identified by City departments to target carbon neutrality needed to be carried taking into account the following key principles:

Social inclusion and justice meaning that the climate transition need to be for all inhabitants of Lyon;
Democracy and participatory approach;
Environmental health and biodiversity: the scope of the City's action needs to take into account the "health" of our entire environment (not only that of people).

At the city level, a vision has been drawn up by members of the Agora, who, as part of the collective journey, have been able to highlight complementary issues and objectives for achieving carbon neutrality (part 3. C.3 - The Agora journey). For example, Agora members identified as "keys to success" putting people at the heart, as well as questioning the issue of growth in our society.

These visions and narratives will continue to be explored within the Agora, in partnership with the Fabrique des Transitions (a national association that give assistance to local authorities to explore new avenues to embark local stakeholders and citizens on climate issues using story-telling approaches). The idea is to move away from a purely technical approach and embark on a broader discussion of what the city of Lyon could become in 2030.

## From the vision to the action plan

Sharing the challenges and the vision drawn up during the drawing up of the new Climate, Air and Energy Plan and the Lyon 2030 Climate Contract were the basis for setting up the action plan and the action portfolio.

Only the issue of sobriety was tackled by the Agora within the Lyon 2030 Climate Contract. However this document is expected to be enriched to respond to the other issues. Similarly, the cooperation and commitment agreements will highlight Agora members' vision for 2030, and their operational commitments to achieving it.

## From the action plan to the investment plan

The investment plan was drawn up based on the actions and assumptions set out in the region's strategic documents, including the City's Climate, Air and Energy Plan and the Metropolitan Climate Plan. Assumptions for 2030 were then analysed to identify areas where the City or the Agora could accelerate GHG reduction, as well as complementary actions to move towards climate neutrality.

## Development of the Agora and Climate Plan action portfolio

The Agora set up in 2023 has chosen to prioritize the issue of sobriety, which focuses on the sectors that emit the most greenhouse gas within the city. This is also an issue on which all stakeholders can take action. Other issues will be addressed over time as the Agora expands (see point c) next steps), and will lead to new commitments.

Achieving carbon neutrality is not associated with a ready-made solution. What the City of Lyon is proposing for its Climate, Air and Energy Plan is an iterative process. This process will enable the city and its stakeholders to assess the impact of their actions year after year, to continue learning from experiments, to draw inspiration from initiatives in other areas and to mobilize the latest innovations.
This continuous improvement must also be nurtured by increasingly close interrelationships between the City and its territory.

Drawing up and implementing commitment and cooperation agreements and collective projects

Conventions for 2030 are currently being drawn up by all Agora members.

On July 11, 16 members presented to the Mayor their commitments that will be included in their agreements. Most of them are linked to the issue of sobriety but not only. Some of the commitments set out in the agreements are directly or indirectly linked to public policies, particularly municipal policies. (cf. Lyon 2030 cooperation and commitment agreements - template and examples).

Beyond this "individual" vision, 7 working groups related to the commitments have emerged collectively to contribute to the dynamics around the Lyon 2030 Climate Contract:

Sharing knowledge on sobriety in buildings
The "sober travel toolbox"
Disseminating and sharing sobriety best practices and helping implement them
Disseminating and implementing responsible digital practices
Creating a waste recovery directory
Creating a hub of collective resources
Imagining, rebuilding, disseminating and renewing Lyon's image after the ecological transition

The groups are all coordinated by one or more Agora members. The projects will be implemented by several members of the Agora and the aim is for them to be completed over a one or two-year period.

Articulation between the municipal Climate, Air and Energy Plan and the Lyon 2030 Climate Contract, implementation of the action portfolio

The link between the municipal Climate, Air and Energy Plan and the Lyon 2030 Climate Contract is effective at different levels:

Governance :

Climate plan governance: certain members of the Agora whose commitments are/will be included in the agreements and/or who are part of the working groups (see above) linked to the actions of the climate plan may be involved in the governance of the Climate, Air and Energy Plan;
The City's elected representatives and departments will be invited to take into account the challenges expressed by the Agora, their commitments and proposals for action targeted to public authorities (see part 4 of the Lyon 2030 Climate Contract);
The direct involvement of City departments and elected representatives in Agora meetings and work, as it was already the case in the first half of 2023, depending on the issues raised.

Updating the Climate, Air and Energy Plan will strengthen the link with the Lyon 2030 Climate Contract. It will also highlight how the Agora participates in or contributes to the climate plan's actions. The Agora will also serve as a source of inspiration for continuous improvement of the City's climate action.

9
The City will support members in implementing their agreements. For instance, the City may mobilise Agora members in responding to certain calls for proposals or local initiatives some of which are or will be launched by the City. For example, in 2023, the City introduced a new scheme called "1 jeune pour ma structure pour le climat" (1 youth in my organisation to tackle climate issues), which supports the recruitment of trainees and/or civic service by not-for-profit structures. Many members of the Agora are eligible and can apply to this scheme, which will contribute to the implementation of their agreement.

Links with the Metropolis

There are a number of ways in which the Lyon 2030 initiative is linked to the Metropolis:

The Metropolis is part of the City's Lyon 2030 governance bodies
The Metropolis is a member of the Agora
The City is part of the Metropolis' PCAET governance bodies
For the updating of the PCAET, the Metropole has agreed to take into account the proposals for action included in the Lyon 2030 Climate Contract, as well as to involve the Agora in the debates that will be organised during the consultation phase.

Also the Metropolis and the City are already developing joint climate actions in several areas:

Co-sponsorship of a number of strategic projects essential to achieving carbon neutrality, in areas such as mobility, adaptation to climate change and urban planning. These cooperative ventures can be progressively strengthened;
There are also plans to set up joint programs and/or participate in joint calls for projects to fight climate change.

# 4. The role of citizens in Lyon 2030

The involvement of citizens in Lyon 2030 covers several dimensions:

Involvement through members of the Agora
Citizens were represented via the presence of several district councils in the construction phase of the Lyon 2030 approach in 2022. A district council joined the first Agora in 2023. In addition, other Agora members who come from the civil society also took part in the Agora;
Many Agora members (sports and cultural associations, schools, etc.) are used to reaching out to citizens, particularly those who are not necessarily aware of ecological transitions. In the Agora roadmap, focus is set on mobilising and engaging citizens and local stakeholders beyond the Agora.
Citizens will also most likely be involved in the implementation of collective or individual projects arising from the Lyon 2030 Climate Contact or the commitment and cooperation agreements.

Involvement in the overall Lyon 2030 approach :
Initiatives targeting citizens are gradually being implemented to strengthen their power to act. For example, the City will launch a climate grant this fall to support youth's initiatives to fight climate change.
The City is composed of 9 administrative districts (called "arrondissements") each with its own municipal team (elected representatives and City staff). The City departments work hand in hand with these districts who are in direct contact with citizens to help them draw up and implement a roadmap on climate change and ecological transition.

In 2022, the City applied to the 30 Pilot Cities' Call for proposals. In the project submitted, actions carried out by the City and some Agora members were planned in every "arrondissements", especially "priority areas" where disadvantage groups live. In view of the need to raise public awareness and provide support, these actions will be reintegrated in the City's application to the 2024 Pilot Cities' Call for proposals.
The City is working on the development of third places and resource centres on climate change and ecological transition in Lyon, led by local stakeholders and geared towards citizens in order to strengthen everyone's ability to act.

To take up the challenge of climate neutrality, the City decided first to focus on local stakeholders. However it plans on gradually giving citizens a greater say. For example, by 2026, the City aims to set up a "citizens' assembly for the future" to discuss cross-cutting issues (ecological, social and climate topics). A link could then be made with the Agora to involve more closely with citizens. Other initiatives could also be investigated, such as carbon cooperatives and citizen conventions.

# 5. Composition of the Agora and role of stakeholders with high carbon impact in the Lyon 2030 approach

The first Agora set up in 2023 represents the diversity of local players that are ready to co-construct a shared vision on how to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 on a city-wide scale. Some have a direct capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (through their assets, their activities, on scopes 1-2 or 3), while others have a capacity to influence other organizations or citizens directly (sports and cultural actors for example) through their role as network leaders (consular chamber, etc.).

In particular, the City wanted to mobilise youth-related structures (higher education establishments, youth and cultural centres, student associations, etc.) and players with the capacity to act on scope 3. The City also wanted to involve stakeholders that have direct access to marginalized groups. Among the Agora members there is Soliha which fights fuel poverty, and the Metropolitan Integration Centre for Employment (MMIE). As part of the enlargement of the Agora, discussions are underway to include other local players involved in social issues as some actions of the Agora roadmap are specifically aimed at disadvantaged groups. In addition, beyond the Agora, as part of the overall Lyon 2030 approach, certain schemes could enable residents of vulnerable neighbourhoods to play a direct role. For example, this is a positive criterion in the awarding of the City's youth climate grants.

As regards companies and stakeholders with a high carbon impact:

Very few installations subject to SEQE-EU 2022 quota are located within the city of Lyon's¹. One corresponds to a boiler belonging to Lyon Hospitals, a member of the Agora. Most installations subject to quota tend to be located within the perimeter of the Metropolis who has launched various initiatives to better measure and support companies with high emissions, notably in the "chemical valley"².
The Agora includes a few companies as well as representatives of the economic sector: Chambre des Métiers et de l'Artisanat (Chamber for Trade and Crafts), as well as the Centre des Jeunes Dirigeants (Centre for Young Leaders). Other stakeholders, such as the Lyon Chamber of Commerce and Industry have expressed their interest in joining the Agora.
The City also has close relations with a number of national/international companies that operate in Lyon. For example, an agreement was signed this year with the SNCF group (passenger and freight transport), which also expressed interest in joining the Agora.

3
The City also participates in initiatives led by the companies themselves, such as the Convention des entreprises pour le climat du bassin lyonnais³, which brings together 70 of the region's companies and institutions for an ecological redirection. Some members of the Agora are involved in both initiatives, and the CEC representative has already spoken in one of the Agora plenary sessions.

Finally, the City continues to develop actions:
Support and promotion of economic stakeholders in their ecological initiatives. For instance the City grants the label "Engagés à Lyon"⁴ (Committed to Lyon) to local organisations that prove that they have a responsible approach when selling their goods or their services
Support the integration of climate issues into its purchasing policy through the "scheme to promote socially and environmentally responsible public procurement".

These pre-existing initiatives are intended to have direct links with the Lyon 2030 approach.

Finally, the Agora also represents territorial diversity, with structures involved in certain areas of the city: neighbourhood committees, associations linked to heritage issues.

## 6. Monitoring and reporting

Indicators have been defined for the actions carried out directly by the City. They are listed in the Climate Air Energy Plan and will be reported on an annual basis. A simplified assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from municipal assets is already drawn up annually in the form of an energy-climate dashboard, and every 3 years, a complete assessment of greenhouse gas emissions is carried out for all the City's activities and assets.

These tools will enable both quantitative and qualitative monitoring of the implementation of actions and the achievement of targets in terms of carbon emissions reduction.

Regarding the actions associated to the 16 commitments listed in the Lyon 2030 Climate Contract, members have identified possible indicators, both quantitative and qualitative. More work needs to be done on these indicators. This will be the subject of a workshop at the Agora's next annual meeting in January 2024.

Concerning the commitment and cooperation agreements, Agora members have been asked to identify indicators for each commitment. They will also be responsible for monitoring them annually or every two years. On this matter, an issue still needs to be tackled: currently the City of Lyon does not have the tools nor the human resources and expertise to analyse in detail the impact of the commitments set out in each cooperation agreement.

The City will also be able to count on the Metropolis, which as part of the PCAET update will be working to better estimate the carbon footprint of the Greater Lyon area. This exercise could be of benefit to the City.

Climate, Air and Energy Plan
for the City of Lyon and the Communal Centre for Social Action

0
Grégory Doucet,
Mayor of Lyon

Climate change is one of the most glaring and worrying symptoms of the environmental crisis. It is having an increasingly significant impact on our societies. At the same time, it is causing us to radically rethink the way we live and the way we do things.

In Lyon, we have chosen to make the climate issue the focus of our term of office. In 2021, we declared a state of climate emergency in 2021. The following year, we adopted the target of becoming climate neutral by 2030. And this year, we're updating the municipal climate plan. Three years after we started, our conviction remains intact, because we know we only have a few more years to maintain the climate balance before it is too late to act.

A key feature of our new climate plan is that the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals underpin the city's climate policy. This gives us an even greater incentive to acknowledge that the issue of planetary limits and the over-exploitation of natural reserves at the expense of the most vulnerable cannot be ignored. It has become vital to turn our backs on the vision of a primarily commercial relationship with our living environment, and

instead to build a society that is fairer and more respectful of all living things.

To achieve this, municipal teams are working hard to bring together all the talented, dedicated people they can muster, supporting them and providing them with material and technical assistance. This is helping to create a large network of local stakeholders committed to the climate.

This is the goal of the Lyon 2030 initiative, which we launched in 2022. As a result of this initiative, the city is now part of a federation of French and European partners. At the same time, we are making the most of our region's successes to help us make limiting our greenhouse gas emissions a priority and, more generally, adapt to climate change.

This climate plan is also the roadmap for a fairer, more peaceful city that looks after everyone and commits its residents and partners to playing their part in the ecological transition. Our city's identity is firmly based on cooperation and active partnership, bringing together all Lyon's stakeholders to help build the world of tomorrow.

Sylvain Godinot

Second Deputy Mayor responsible for Ecological Transition and Heritage

For a city like Lyon, the challenge of ecological transition is twofold. We need to develop a public policy that reflects the urgency of the climate change situation, while at the same time placing inclusion and social justice at the heart of our concerns. This document is the fourth edition of the city's climate plan since we made our first commitments in 2007. Building on the experience gained from its earlier incarnations, Lyon is resolutely continuing and stepping up its action.

This new climate plan is intended to signal a clear increase in Lyon's green ambitions. Climate neutrality is the only way to halt the unfolding environmental disaster. For the first time, we are taking responsibility for looking at the climate crisis from a more integrated perspective, by considering the impact of greenhouse gases from our activities outside Lyon's borders.

Extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent around the world, and it is our responsibility to act to limit their impact. For this reason, this climate plan also looks at the city of the future from the perspective of adaptation and resilience.

Halfway through our term of office, we have already achieved a great deal. The Energy Moderation Plan adopted in October 2022 has delivered considerable energy savings for the community, through working together and setting an example. This is set to continue with the strategy for the ecological transition of our property assets, which the city is preparing to vote on in the coming months. Renewable energy is also at the heart of the city's energy moderation approach, and a significant proportion of its energy needs are now met by French biogas from 100% renewable sources.

What makes this document so innovative is its openness to local stakeholders and the invitation extended to them to be co-constructors. The city has placed all its trust in the collective intelligence of its local partners by asking them to draw up this climate plan and ensure that it is properly monitored and implemented, so that together we can imagine and build the city of tomorrow: Lyon 2030.

Building tomorrow's world means first and foremost living it in the present, so that we can set our sights on the most critical concerns. Together, we can take on the climate challenge!

GLOSSARY...40

This document was published by the City of Lyon in 2023.

Developed jointly by the Ecological Transition Task Force and Lyon's municipal services, it is the framework document for the city's climate action across its property assets, areas of responsibility and services.

It is complementary to the Lyon 2030 Pact, jointly developed with regional stakeholders from the Agora Lyon 2030 initiative. The Pact is a framework document for climate action in the region.

# Climate action: what is the situation in Lyon?
what is the situation in Lyon?

# Introduction

Human activities are responsible for the climate change experienced around the world in recent decades. Lyon is no exception. The climate in Lyon has already changed, impacting the everyday lives of Lyon's residents, particularly the most vulnerable. If nothing is done between now and 2070, climate scenarios for Lyon predict that temperatures will be similar to those in Algiers.

Taking action on climate change means adapting our lifestyles, questioning our relationship with the living world and the planet's limits, and challenging how we organise our society and how we shape our public policies. On a city scale, drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions means inventing new ways of creating society and cities, and imagining and achieving a more frugal future. Cities must also adapt to extreme heat dry soil and the potential acceleration of extreme weather events.

To meet this climate challenge, in 2022 and as part of a European call for projects, the city set itself the ambitious target of achieving climate neutrality for its property assets, areas of responsibilities and urban area by 2030. This strong commitment was recognised by the European Commission when the city of Lyon was selected to take part in the programme to have 100 smart, climate-neutral cities by 2030.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

While the European Union has set out to be climate neutral by 2050, this programme aims to turn 100 European cities into pioneering local authorities capable of achieving this target by 2030.

# Why has the city set itself a target to be climate neutral by 2030?

In March 2023, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reiterated that the 2020s are a crucial decade for combating climate change:

"Climate change is a threat to the well-being of humanity and the health of the planet. There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all [...]. If we want to limit global warming to  $+1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , we need to reduce our CO2 emissions by  $48\%$  by 2030 compared with 2019 levels. [...] The choices and actions we take in this decade will affect the planet and its people for thousands of years. [...] Without immediate, effective and equitable mitigation and adaptation measures, climate change will increasingly threaten ecosystems, biodiversity, livelihoods, and the health and well-being of current and future generations."

In this global crisis, the target set by the city may seem both derisory and disproportionate, since its capacity for action and influence are limited and conditioned by national, European and even international frameworks. That said, cities are now responsible for  $70\%$  of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. It is already within our grasp, at this city level, to ask the right questions, examine the financial, human, regulatory and organisational obstacles, identify the mechanisms for overcoming them and draw up scenarios for achieving this target. As a result, the ability that cities have to transform and take action can serve as a powerful example to all.

# 1. The greenhouse effect, climate change and climate neutrality: what do they all mean?

## The greenhouse effect?

This natural phenomenon is what makes life on Earth possible, but it is magnified by our activities, leading to global warming.

**Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere**
Naturally occurring, they retain some of the heat from the sun's rays. The more greenhouse gases there are, the more heat is retained and the higher the average temperature is.

**Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities**

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

**Anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases**

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

**Biological carbon sinks**

**Climate or carbon neutrality**
= balance between the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities and their absorption by natural means or by human-made technologies

## What are the major emitters?

The production of these greenhouse gases, some of which already occur naturally in the atmosphere, is linked to four main human activities: transport, industrial output, buildings and agriculture.

**Carbon dioxide** – CO₂ – 81% – Emitted by fuel combustion and deforestation

**Methane** – CH₄ – 11% – emitted by agriculture, waste and industry

**Nitrous oxide** – N₂O – 5% – emitted by agriculture and industry

**Fluorinated gases and sulphur hexafluoride**: synthetic chemical compounds

A single unit of measurement has been adopted to compare greenhouse gases: a tonne of CO₂ equivalent

**Ecosystems**: soils, forests, oceans, etc.

The increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by human activity is leading to rapid global warming and climate change

## What are the visible effects of climate change…

### ... TODAY

**A net global warming**
since 1850 +1.1°C
With local variations
In France: +1.5°C
In Lyon: +1.9°C

An accelerated rise in sea levels and the acidification of the oceans

An increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather events

A disruption of the ecological balance due to a combination of climate change and human pressure on ecosystems

### ... AND TOMORROW?

**Several warming scenarios between**:
+1.5°C rapid achievement of global carbon neutrality
+4°C growth based on fossil fuels

**Food and health crises become sources of conflict and migration**

**Diplacement of communities due to flooding of coastal areas**

**Major disturbances in ecosystems and mass extinctions of species**

**Continuation of phenomena we are seeing already**
what is the situation in Lyon?

# 2. Key figures on greenhouse gases for the Lyon area as a whole

## Lyon, an urban area

In 2019, all the activities carried out in the Lyon area emitted:

**1,253 KtCO₂eq**

How much is that per person living in Lyon?

,969 Lyon residents, who each emit 9 tCO₂eq every year:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

**2,4 teqCO₂**

Within the Lyon area

**6,6 teqCO₂**

Outside the Lyon area

ORCAE, INSEE and SDES data 2019

The lives and work of Lyon's residents depend on importing many goods and services, and therefore on industrial, agricultural and transport activities that emit greenhouse gases outside the area. This explains the difference between local greenhouse gas emissions (2.4 tCO₂eq) and the overall carbon footprint of each Lyon resident (9 tCO₂eq).

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

What produces GHG emissions in Lyon?

These emissions are shared between:

Industry, agriculture, etc.

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

ORCAE data

## Lyon, an urban area on the road to climate neutrality

While current trends show a decline in greenhouse gas emissions in Lyon, a real change of direction and acceleration is needed if we are to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, as the initial 2030 projection exercise carried out by the City in 2022 shows. This initial projection will be refined and updated in line with the latest knowledge and public policies implemented in the area by the City of Lyon and Greater Lyon metropolitan area.

KtCO₂eq

Total direct and indirect GHG emissions assessed

Between 2010 and 2019, the City managed to reduce its GHG emissions despite a growing population and an increase in the infrastructure, staff and expenditure. The City's performance in terms of controlling municipal emissions is therefore constantly improving.

The climate plan includes actions to reduce GHG emissions, adjusted following the 2019 assessment. As energy, purchasing and travel are the largest sources of municipal GHG emissions, the plan gives greater priority to actions to reduce emissions from these sources.

## What's the path to climate neutrality?

### Efforts undertaken by the City of Lyon are already paying off...

A fleet of vehicles undergoing transformation and rationalisation

+390 bicycles and 80 electric or CNG vehicles between 2010 and 2022
vehicles not replaced between 2010 and 2020

Increased efficiency of street lighting:

% reduction in consumption between 2010 and 2021

% of energy consumed from renewable and recovered sources

but more needs to be done to achieve climate neutrality by 2030

To measure how far the City has progressed on this path and the efforts that still to be made, the climate plan's actions have been quantified.

A number of actions aim to improve the way in which greenhouse gas emissions from purchasing and travel are quantified and tracked, so that targets for these areas can be set.
what is the situation in Lyon?

# 3. Lyon, a city committed to the climate since 2008

The City has been involved in the fight against climate change since 2008, through its commitment to the European Covenant of Mayors movement. In 2010, and every three years thereafter, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions assessments are carried out on the City's property assets and areas of responsibility. These are used to identify the areas with the highest emissions and to then develop an action plan to reduce those greenhouse gas emissions. The first action plan was published in 2013, and was strengthened and expanded in 2015 to cover climate change adaptation in the city.

The 2015 action plan set out strategic targets for the City's property assets and areas of responsibility that were in line with Greater Lyon metropolitan area's targets for 2020:

Reduce its direct GHG emissions by 20% compared with 2010
Reduce its energy consumption by 20% compared with 2010
Ensure that 20% of the municipal energy mix is made up of renewable energy.

Through its actions, the City delivered on its commitment to two of the three objectives it had set itself. While it achieved the commitments to reduce GHG emissions linked to energy consumption (35%) and to improve the energy mix to include more renewable energy (35%), the City only managed to reduce its energy consumption by 17.3% between 2010 and 2020.

A third action plan was unveiled in 2019. It laid out a new course to commit the City to a path to carbon neutrality by 2050. This initial target was stepped up in 2022 with a particularly ambitious commitment to achieving climate neutrality for all emissions from the city by 2030, to which this fourth climate plan contributes.

The climate plan is part of a series of initiatives and objectives set at European, national, regional and city levels.

The City's climate plan is a way of incorporating the actions undertaken by these major regional and international bodies into the city's assets and responsibilities. The City is the operational level for major projects, and has set itself the target of 2030 with the aim of paving the way for change through action and inspiring everyone involved, at every level.

Greater Lyon is an essential ally for the City when it comes to implementing far-reaching public climate policies, particularly in the areas of mobility, development and tourism. Close cooperation (technical, financial, innovation, etc.) is key to achieving climate neutrality.

# Lyon, a city with international reach

For over 15 years, the City has been involved in international initiatives to cement its commitment to the climate. As a result, it now belongs to a network of major European and global cities that are committed to the ecological transition.

what is the situation in Lyon?

# 5. Municipal climate action to overcome systemic obstacles

If we are to achieve the ambitious goal of an ecological and climate transition that will lead the city of Lyon to climate neutrality, we need to tackle a number of systemic obstacles. Systemic obstacles are those major stumbling blocks to the transition that are inherent in the way our economic and social systems operate.

## Assessing climate action

Existing tools and available data can be used to monitor the implementation of actions, but they cannot be used to track the impact that these actions have on the climate. Although concrete actions can be quantified, the majority of them involve incentives and awareness-raising, which makes it difficult to measure their direct impact.

As part of its efforts to improve its assessment of greenhouse gas emissions, the City is developing methods and testing tools to improve this monitoring.

## Cost of action and cost of inaction

Consumption practices all too often put businesses in a situation where the cost of action does not reflect the cost of impact. Put another way, an economic solution is rarely an ecological solution. This kind of situation does not encourage widespread investment in good ecological practices, and generates inequalities and a feeling of injustice. More broadly, this calls into question the "polluter pays" principle and how it is applied.

When it comes to the investment needed to carry out ecological transition projects, the principle of a rapid return on investment tends to be incompatible with these projects, in which the economic benefits, where they exist, are spread over time. It is also often the case that the benefits of a project are intangible without direct economic knock-on effects: global climate, local cooling, health, etc.

This is why public authorities have an essential role to play in these investments. The City of Lyon has already made a major commitment to the ecological transition through its massive multi-year investment plan.

Nevertheless, public- and private-sector economic efforts are recognised by the government as insufficient to meet our climate commitments, and the City will be working to quantify them and mobilise additional resources.

## Sharing a new vision of society

Cultural and social resistance to accepting man-made climate change can also hamper the implementation of ecological policies, as reflected in the proportion of climate sceptics in French society in 2022 (37%), according to the International Observatory on Climate and Public Opinion (Obs'COP).

The consumerist narrative that is now predominant has had a major impact on people's perceptions and has shaped practices and infrastructure. The model based on consumption as the driving force is at the heart of our problem. A rapid and widespread commitment to a vision of moderation and to habits that reflect this at all levels (consumption, mobility, property, etc.) runs counter to the ideals commonly held by French society.

To overcome this cultural resistance, the City is looking to involve as many people as possible in climate action.

All these systemic obstacles call for action both within the City itself and well beyond its areas of responsibility and sphere of influence. It intends to be as specific as possible in identifying these obstacles and their consequences, and to play its part as far as possible in removing them.

# 6. The new climate plan: bringing municipal powers down to local level

## A response to the climate emergency

There are three main goals at the heart of the climate plan:

to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to put the City on course for climate neutrality by 2030, while also improving air quality
to adapt the area to climate change and, more broadly, prevent the long-term effects and risks of these changes
to raise awareness and increase the sense of responsibility not only among city staff but also among all local residents. The fight against climate change can only be systemic if everyone is involved at their own level.

A total of 38 actions have been identified to help achieve this.

## A new openness towards local stakeholders

Until now, the City's action on climate change has focused mainly on its own services and property. But with this new climate plan, the City of Lyon intends to create momentum that goes beyond its internal operations by bringing on board a wider range of local people.

The plan primarily targets local stakeholders directly connected with the City: associations, businesses, institutions, public service users and residents. More broadly, it covers everyone in Lyon that is part of the "Lyon 2030: Inspiring Change" initiative launched by the City in 2022.

The City has set itself the goal of putting into motion, inspiring and facilitating the deployment of local initiatives. To achieve this, the various municipal services provide support to their partners in their ecological

## A cross-functional, co-constructed climate plan that reflects renewed municipal action

The City, like other local authorities, is currently grappling with major cross-cutting

transition (guides, charters, drop-in centres, etc.), maintain these relationships and organise meetings and events.

## Beyond climate change, a more ambitious goal of local resilience

The major disruption to the climate caused by human activity is now compelling us to find ways of adapting to the increasing number of new crises.

The climate plan is therefore part of a wider strategy of resilience that is currently being considered. This strategy draws on the experience of recent crises, such as the Covid-19 and energy crises, which the city has already dealt with swiftly and responsively. It is also an opportunity to learn more about our community and its ability to adapt.

This systemic approach has led the city to adopt a climate plan that embraces transitions that are about more than just climate change. It is therefore built around a number of complementary and essential principles:

Inclusiveness and social justice, for a climate transition that benefits everyone in Lyon;
Democracy and shared responsibility, for a climate transition that harnesses all available energy and intelligence to build a joint project together;
Consideration for the living world through environmental health and biodiversity, for a transition whose scope must go beyond humankind and take into account the health of our entire environment.

These three key principles form the basis of the City's climate action. By taking these issues into account, we can also make sure that the local area is more resilient to climate disruption.

issues that exceed the capabilities of traditional organisational structures.

To meet the challenge of the climate emergency, it has set up a new team, the Ecological Transition Task Force, to oversee
what is the situation in Lyon?

the development and implementation of public policies for the ecological transition. This team, working with all the municipal services and in close collaboration with elected representatives, has jointly developed this climate plan.

This new approach will not stop with the approval of the climate plan. Rapid change at all levels requires agility to adapt to new challenges and incorporate innovations. This is why the climate plan is not a document set in stone, but a framework that will continue to evolve and be regularly updated.

## Finding our own path to climate neutrality

It is currently difficult for everyone to look beyond current trends, preventing us from making drastic changes to our habits and ways of doing things.

While the climate plan reflects the City's ambitious goals, it is only the first milestone on the road to climate neutrality, and we will continue to build on it as we move forward.

In addition to technical solutions and innovations, it is a shared narrative of a climate-neutral city that is being written with city staff, local stakeholders and residents, particularly children and artists, to ensure that the ecological transition is firmly rooted in Lyon's identity and in an attractive vision of the future.

At the city level, we propose looking ahead from today to 2030, following the path mapped out by the climate plan. The plan's four main goals provide a blueprint for the carbon-neutral city of 2030.

# A City that uses energy and resources in moderation

Why do we want a City that uses both energy and resources in moderation?

The City has a significant number of buildings and buys a considerable amount of energy each year. As lifestyles and consumption patterns change and we adopt practices that better respect the planet's limits, the City has a duty to set an example and lead the way in moderating consumption. Looking beyond the local community, municipal public procurement is an important lever for promoting and stimulating environmentally friendly and circular supply chains.

Energy consumption and purchasing are central to municipal action on climate change, as they are among the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

In terms of digital technology, the City of Lyon manages more than 50,000 digital and IT devices of all sizes

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

,600 m² of solar panels on municipal roofs, producing an estimated 502 MWh/year.

Nearly 79,000 street lighting points, 35% of which are LED, representing electricity consumption of 21 GWh in 2021.

Around 36% renewable and recovered energy used in municipal buildings (biogas, geothermal energy, biomass, heat recovery from incineration plants, electricity purchased from renewable sources) in 2019.

,200 municipal buildings covering approximately 2 Mm², with energy consumption (from public electricity, gas, heating and cooling networks and wood-fired boilers) of around 157 GWh/year.

## What are the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions?

The climate plan must make it easier to quantify the GHG reductions resulting from the actions implemented and measure the shortfalls in achieving the carbon neutrality target. These shortfalls will be gradually reduced by stepping up and diversifying actions.

**Estimated savings of 16.9 KtCO2eq as a result of the climate plan's actions on building energy and street lighting between 2019 and 2030 out of 22.8 KtCO2eq emitted in 2019**

Reducing energy consumption and increasing the use of renewable and recovered energy is one of the main ways of reducing municipal greenhouse gas emissions.

Purchasing is also an important area for reduction. Although it is currently difficult to quantify the effects of our actions, we are planning to gradually quantify our projects and purchasing contracts.

The switch to reconditioned equipment and the increase in the lifespan of IT hardware will result in a saving of around 0.45 KtCO2eq.

# A City that is peaceful and breathable

Why do we want a peaceful, breathable City?

Lyon's highly urban area has been largely shaped by private car use and predominantly road-based logistical transport. These forms of transport take up a huge proportion of public space for traffic and parking.

Road traffic and current heating systems are sources of air pollution, with recommended health limits being exceeded for fine particles and nitrogen dioxide in particular. Traffic also generates noise pollution.

Lyon city council owns a large fleet of vehicles that enable its employees to travel to and from work. It also influences the commuting patterns of its 8,500 employees and the journeys that users of its services make to visit its sites.

Transport is a major factor in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, both within the city and across the local area.

More than 120 bus lines, 4 metro lines, 2 funicular railway lines and 7 tram lines serving Lyon and more than 73 municipalities. 6 railway stations served by regional, national and international trains
In 2019, most people in Lyon travelled to work by public transport – 38.5% – or by active modes of transport – 23%
In 2022, most staff travelled to work by public transport – 43% – or by active modes of transport – 35% – compared with only 22% by private motor vehicle

# What are the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions?

The climate plan must make it easier to quantify the GHG reductions resulting from the action implemented and measure the shortfalls in achieving the carbon neutrality target. These shortfalls will be gradually reduced by stepping up and diversifying actions.

One of the main ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is to reduce the emissions linked to work-related travel by staff and the use of municipal sites by users.

Raising awareness and supporting changes in practices and shifts to other modes of transport, although difficult to quantify, are key factors at local level.

Lastly, although its impact is also difficult to measure, sustainable planning is a key area for reducing GHGs, given its role in shaping future uses and mobility and the fact that the works themselves are carried out in a low-impact manner.

# A City that looks after everyone and adapts to global warming

Why do we want a City that looks after everyone and adapts to global warming?

Global warming is making certain natural phenomena, such as heatwaves and droughts, more frequent, longer and more intense. Heavily paved urban areas are more likely to create heat islands, where temperatures rise more sharply.

The people of Lyon are not all equal when it comes to global warming. Whether related to health risks, pollution or fuel poverty, the most vulnerable groups are often the hardest hit.

Ensuring that everyone has access to renovated, sustainable housing, a healthy environment and a balanced, sustainable diet is a fundamental issue of social justice. Cooling the city by greening, conserving water and preventing climate risks are all part of protecting life in all its forms.

,000 households in Lyon, or 9% of all households, have been identified as living in fuel poverty.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The City has 442 hectares of managed green spaces, along with 58,000 trees. With its 300 parks, squares and gardens, it is already the fifth greenest local authority in France, according to the Green Cities Observatory (2020).

Over the last 5 years, between 5.3% and 25.3% of deaths were recorded during heatwaves in the Rhône department.

## What are the goals for a less vulnerable local area?

The aim of the climate plan is to reduce the area's vulnerability to climate change through adaptation measures. A study on the local area's vulnerability to climate change carried out in 2021 highlights the following key issues:

**Protecting the health and quality of life of the people of Lyon, including conserving water, combating air pollution and indoor air quality, and reducing heat islands at a time when heatwaves and droughts are on the increase.**

**Preserving biodiversity and natural habitats.**

**Ensuring the long-term viability of economic activities, particularly given their exposure to flood risk and the impact of rising energy prices. The tourist industry is also likely to be affected by periods of extreme heat.**

The climate plan includes the actions suggested by the vulnerability study to address these issues: step up the greening of public spaces, continue the biodiversity atlas, include the green and blue belt in the local urban and housing plan, support energy renovations and behavioural changes, etc.

## And beyond the climate?

# A City that encourages everyone to get involved

Why do we want a City that encourages everyone to get involved?

Cities are where people, developments and activities are concentrated. As a result, they are also where emissions are concentrated. Lyon's residents and businesses, who are partly responsible for these emissions, are also key to limiting them. The millions of visitors to Lyon every year also contribute to the city's greenhouse gas emissions.

The City wants to give everyone the tools they need to tackle climate change and take action at the individual level. To achieve this, it has enlisted the help of its departments and key partners to work in direct contact with the people of Lyon.

## What is Lyon's partnership network?

More than 1,500 subsidised associations
public institutions: Tony Garnier Hall, the CCAS, etc.
mixed and inter-communal associations
companies: SPL, SA-HLM, etc.
public or economic interest groups: Job Centre, GIP Café Culture, etc.

# What are the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions?

One of the main ways in which the City can reduce municipal and local GHGs is linked to changes in the habits and lifestyles of residents, local stakeholders and users of Lyon's infrastructure.

It has not yet been possible to accurately quantify the impact of awareness-raising and incentive campaigns on greenhouse gas emissions. Several actions in the climate plan will involve developing tools and methods to improve data collection, measure this impact and take appropriate measures to meet the challenges:

Helping cultural centres prepare their Carbon Assessments and then working together to draw up action plans
Assessing the impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions of visitors travelling to events in public spaces
Involving associations subsidised by the City in climate actions by supporting, training and providing them with tools.

More broadly, the Lyon 2030 initiative will help us gain a better understanding of the practices adopted by the City's partners and track changes in them.

# 1. Involving the entire city administration in the challenges of ecological transition

To make the necessary shift towards an ecological transition that addresses the challenges facing the City of Lyon, the City is undertaking a far-reaching transformation of how its departments operate. This process is being driven both by elected representatives who are in favour of a general commitment by the city administration to carbon neutrality, and by departments and staff who have already launched internal initiatives that need to be structured, strengthened and scaled up.

This transformation requires a radical change in practices, the systematisation of solutions provided to departments and the integration of the goal of climate neutrality into all public policy framework documents, regardless of whether they are directly linked to the ecological transition.

A general drive is therefore under way to change the way in which the city administration develops public policy, so that its environmental impact is routinely taken into consideration. The main objective of such a measure is twofold: firstly, to institutionalise the ecological transition in public services, and secondly, to create an ecological administration culture, so that it becomes an integral part of the process.

The systematic inclusion of the challenges of ecological transition in the way the City is organised requires commitment from the

entire city administration, over and above strong political backing: every department and every member of staff has a role to play!

The city administration is involved at several levels:

The General Services Department is responsible for these public policies and plays a key role in communicating them to managers. The departments are involved at different levels in implementing the climate plan: some have been involved in environmental policies for a long time and were already coordinating actions under previous plans, while others have recently taken the lead or are involved in climate actions. Lastly, some resource departments are not directly involved in coordinating the actions of the climate plan, but they are essential in supporting the changes.

The Ecological Transition Task Force (MTE), a cross-departmental task force set up in 2021, is responsible for steering, facilitating and providing technical support for the City's overarching ecological transition projects. It works within the various departments and services to lead, raise awareness and support change. It organises and leads the network of ecological transition coordinators, and ensures that planning documents and schemes relating to ecological transition are properly drawn up.
The City is preparing to take action

# Involving and equipping departments and employees to implement the climate plan and bringing them fully on board with the ecological transition

Bringing the climate plan to life also means getting all our staff on board and encouraging them to take part in implementing the actions at their own level.

To help achieve this, the City is making use of a number of resources: the network of 80 ecological transition coordinators in their departments, the Administration Project, training courses, events and associated communication tools.

All of this hinges on creating a common culture through which the City Council hopes to achieve two shared goals:

firstly, to ensure that every member of staff takes these issues on board as part of their day-to-day work, helping to bring about a far-reaching, mutually supported transition in the way they do their jobs;
secondly, to make the ecological transition a key factor in Lyon's appeal at all levels, thereby strengthening the City Council's identity as an environmentally-friendly, innovative and model administrative body.

In addition to these resources currently being put in place and ramped up, the Ecological Transition Task Force, with the support of the network of transition coordinators and departments, is continuing to jointly develop and distribute resources and tools, which are available to all staff via the municipal intranet and shared at meetings organised by the task force.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

An Administration Project jointly developed with staff in 2021, giving prominence to the ecological transition and experimentation:

24 concrete actions to be rolled out to staff
Including innovative actions such as the creation of a Citizens' Climate Convention for City Staff (3CA) involving some 60 staff members
the implementation each year of concrete, cross-functional projects led by staff through the Municipal Responsibility Centres (CRMs).

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

A network of more than 80 Ecological Transition Coordinators with a new roadmap for 2022, which:

Strengthens the link between the departments and the Ecological Transition Task Force and provides a direct link with the City's wide range of functional areas
Contributes to an internal culture of ecological transition
Contributes to the development and implementation of the City's ecological transition policy.

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

Internal communication and events to promote and share the City's ecological transition initiatives:

High points throughout the year on key themes
Energy, waste, mobility, purchasing, etc.
A dedicated space in internal communication tools
City Intranet, flyer attached to pay slips, newsletters, Traits d'Union magazine, etc.
Regular information and experience-sharing meetings through the Time webinars.

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

Training and awareness-raising tools to help everyone take ownership of the issues at their own level:

Target of raising awareness of ecological transition issues among 6,000 employees by 2026
Catalogue of ecological transition training courses and a specific training plan for each department
Creation of a welcome kit and event entitled "Taking Action for the Ecological Transition" for all new employees.

#

The Communal Centre for Social Action (CCAS), a long-standing part of the City of Lyon's climate strategies...

Since it carried out its first greenhouse gas emissions assessment in 2010 and produced its first climate plan in 2013, the City of Lyon has always included the CCAS in its scope for quantifying emissions and then taking action. More broadly, the CCAS is included in the entire climate initiative for the City of Lyon's areas of responsibility and property assets:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The CCAS is also involved in a number of theme-based initiatives led by the City:

Involvement in the Ecological Transition Strategy for City Buildings (STEP), covering both renovation and photovoltaic systems as well as energy-use moderation, with some specific winter and summer requirements for buildings housing elderly people.

Involvement in the development of the Employer Mobility Plan for the City and the CCAS, but managing its own independent fleet of a dozen vehicles, which it is gradually replacing with a fleet compatible with the City's low emissions zone.

Involvement down the line in the future Zero Waste, Zero Wastage strategy, with the CCAS already included in the City of Lyon's biowaste contract and a stated desire to be included in other cross-cutting contracts to improve waste sorting and collecting at its sites.

The CCAS has an independent purchasing policy, but nevertheless questions its impact on the climate. The fact that it is grouped together with the City for certain contracts gives it easier access to greener solutions, for example when buying energy.

with its own actions

The CCAS is overseeing several climate plan sub-actions, particularly as part of the goal to be "A City that looks after everyone and adapts to global warming":

Make it easier for everyone to access sustainable healthy, high-quality food on municipal premises

Through its catering services in retirement homes and care homes for the elderly, the CCAS is involved in renewing food contracts with a view to providing healthy, environmentally friendly food

The CCAS is working to provide healthy eating for all through its food centre: social restaurant, food third place and community grocery shop

Reduce fuel poverty in winter and summer

The CCAS will be involved in developing a joint action plan with Greater Lyon to tackle fuel poverty and support the SLIME+ programme, particularly with regard to identifying households and helping them escape fuel poverty (agreement with SOLIHA (a social housing support organisation))

Integrate climate change into risk prevention documents for the local area and the City of Lyon

As part of the departmental heatwave plan, the CCAS manages and coordinates the heatwave alert register and provides Lyon residents with cool places to stay during periods of extreme heat

The CCAS will be included in the future action to strengthen and share the provisions of the "heatwave plans"
The City is preparing to take action

## Municipal climate action throughout the City through the commitment of its nine borough councils

Borough councils (mairies d'arrondissement, MAs) are the City's direct point of contact with the people of Lyon. They manage local educational, social, sports, cultural, community and other facilities. They are an essential link in the process of implementing initiatives that set an example in terms of ecological transition.

To encourage networking and accelerate the move towards the ecological transition, inter-borough groups have been set up to facilitate cross-disciplinary work on these issues. Two ecological transition coordinators have been identified as key contacts for all the borough councils.

Since 2021, a simplified tool for planning and implementing climate-air-energy policies deployed by ADEME has been used by borough councils to formalise and monitor their ecological transition actions. The Ecological Transition Task Force (MTE), supported by the ALEC (local energy and climate agency), is helping them with this process, and the tool (Climat Pratic) helps them implement measures that are appropriate and proportionate to their area.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The 12 measures identified as priorities for the borough councils in the Climat Pratic tool are included in each of the climate plan priorities as follows:

### The City is preparing to take action

Financing and budgeting the climate-air-energy policy
Training and mobilising elected representatives and departments on climate-air-energy issues

### 1. A City that uses energy and resources in moderation

Setting an example with new and renovated public buildings
Setting an example in eco-responsible public procurement
Recovering residual waste and biowaste

### 2. A City that is peaceful and breathable

Promoting sustainable mobility within the local authority
Using urban planning documents to ensure the implementation of climate-air-energy targets and combat land artificialisation

### 3. A City that looks after everyone and adapts to global warming

### 4. A City that gives everyone the opportunity to get involved

Promoting sustainable economic activities
Developing education and awareness-raising initiatives in schools and early childhood centres
Cooperating with professionals in the building and property sectors
Involving civil society by developing consultation processes

# 2. Strengthening the steering and coordination of the climate plan

The updated climate plan was coordinated within the city administration by the Ecological Transition Task Force (MTE). It will continue to play a leading, steering and coordinating role in the implementation of the climate plan.

## Consolidating monitoring and assessment tools

The MTE will rely on the monitoring, assessment and reporting tools already used for previous climate plans. A data officer will be responsible for maintaining these tools and developing them where necessary with a view to improving them and achieving the climate plan's targets. They will also be responsible for streamlining how data is collected from the municipality's departments and partners, and for analysing it.

With regard to accounting for greenhouse gas emissions, a number of actions are already in progress or are being planned to provide a more complete and accurate picture. This work should also help refine the steps on the path to carbon neutrality and, as a result, the goals of certain climate plan actions that have not yet been quantified. This exercise will also be carried out by the MTE in close collaboration with municipal departments.

While the priority today is to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, some emissions cannot be completely eliminated. Quantifying these irreducible emissions will provide an opportunity in the medium term to start thinking about solutions.

## Adding a financial approach to monitoring the climate plan

For the first time, the City is endeavouring to combine the monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions with a financial approach, which will provide it with the information it needs to develop an investment plan consistent with the goals set out in the climate plan.

Based on current funding allocated to climate plan actions, the City will estimate the funding and costs required to achieve climate neutrality.

At the same time, a budget monitoring and assessment framework will be developed to track progress in implementing the investment plan.

## Testing new forms of management and coordination

As part of the overall update, the city administration and elected representatives were involved in testing new ways of working. Experimentation will continue to be an important part of managing and implementing this climate plan. In addition to monitoring technical and financial operations, additional objectives have been set:

Keep up the momentum on climate issues within the city administration, involving all levels so that everyone feels they are a part of the climate plan;
Make annual adjustments to the action plan to boost its impact: revise or strengthen certain measures, develop new actions, etc.;
Consolidate and maintain the relationship between the Agora Lyon 2030 and municipal staff.

The operational implementation of these objectives still needs to be built around the following areas of work:

Strong political leadership and the setting up of cross-functional steering bodies supported by the Lyon 2030 Steering Committee and the Ecological Transition Council;
Specific support provided by the Ecological Transition Task Force to:
departments whose activities are associated with high GHG emissions
departments that play a key role in helping the city adapt to climate change
departments that can help bring the City's partners together around these issues;
Organising a key climate plan workshop each year, with the twofold objective of reviewing progress on the climate plan, useful for preparing the Lyon in Transition annual report, and working on updating the plan with changes to actions (content, objectives, resources, etc.) and new measures;
Integrating and promoting the Lyon 2030 initiative in municipal projects, certification labels and public policies with a direct link to ecological transition, such as the purchasing policy;
Making full use of the City's internal networks, first and foremost the network of ecological transition coordinators;
Giving staff a voice through the future Citizens' Climate Convention for City Staff (3CA);
Organising an annual day for institutional and financial partners to discuss the obstacles to deploying the climate plan actions.

# 3. Providing a funding package that meets the challenges ahead

## A multi-year programme focused on the ecological transition

A goal as ambitious as carbon neutrality requires substantial funding. That is why, in its 2021-2026 Multi-year Investment Plan (PPI), the City is allocating a third of its budget to the ecological transition. Energy-efficient renovation of buildings, the phasing out of diesel in the municipal vehicle fleet, the modernisation of street lighting and the greening of the city are the investment priorities related to the ecological transition. In all, some €350 million will be invested over six years.

## Use of green bonds

The City has chosen to use green bonds to limit the carbon impact of its bank borrowing. Several financial institutions have been selected, in line with professional requirements for tracing the origin of funds and ethical finance. Priority is being given to green bonds that support social and ecological transition projects, rather than an approach based solely on the most cost-effective option.

The strong support shown for Lyon's ecological transition must be maintained and strengthened if the City's climate commitments are to be met.

## Leveraging external funding

The City has already secured external sources of funding (ADEME, the DSIL local investment support grant, Green Fund, European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Horizon Europe programme, CEE, etc.) but needs to boost this to finance ecological transition projects.

A resource team of two members of staff from the Finance Department and the Ecological Transition Task Force has been set up for this purpose. Its work will focus on the following tasks:

Identifying, through regular meetings with the operational departments, the strategic projects that need external financing;
Keeping an active watch to identify sources of funding suitable for municipal projects;
Organising theme-specific meetings with the operational departments to discuss an identified need or the opportunity for aid, and to match the aid with the project;
Assisting with preparing grant applications or responding to calls for projects;
Providing operational and financial monitoring of funded projects in line with funders' requirements.

## Protecting the City against climatic risks

The sheer number of claims linked to climate change is jeopardising the insurance industry's current model, with its problems of risk calculation and modelling, financial balance and claims management. This situation highlights the importance of municipal action on climate change and, more broadly, on limiting the impacts of climate change and the City's resilience to it.

However, the City, like others, is being affected by increasingly cautious insurers. It will therefore continue to keep an ear to the ground and, if necessary, play its part in seeing that new insurance schemes are introduced.
The City is preparing to take action

# 4. Lyon 2030: Inspiring Change, a new local and experimental approach

To accelerate the move towards carbon neutrality, the City has set itself a new objective of speeding up climate-related initiatives in the region as part of the Lyon 2030: Inspiring Change initiative, launched in 2022.

The City is keen to encourage new approaches to commitment and cooperation and to develop various activities to support the

efforts of municipal staff, local stakeholders and the general public in taking action:

This new framework for cooperation and climate action is consistent with the City's climate policy (local climate-air-energy plan), with Greater Lyon supporting and participating in the Lyon 2030 initiative.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

# Lyon, selected for the European "100 Smart, Climate-Neutral Cities by 2030" programme

Lyon's commitment to the climate and the launch of the Lyon 2030 initiative have been recognised by the European Commission, which in April 2022 selected the city to take part in its "100 Smart, Climate-Neutral Cities by 2030" programme. This programme, which involves nine French local authorities, aims to turn 100 European cities into pioneering local authorities ready to take on the challenge of

achieving the climate neutrality target set for the European Union by 2050. Each city selected for the programme is expected to work with local stakeholders to produce a Climate City Contract that includes commitments for 2030, together with an action plan and an investment plan.

The new climate plan for the City of Lyon and the CCAS is the implementation at local level of the goal to be climate neutral by 2030 and is part of the Climate City Contract.

# The Agora, at the heart of the Lyon 2030 initiative

The Agora Lyon 2030 is at the heart of this initiative. Set up at the beginning of 2023, this community of Lyon-based stakeholders is ready to work together to build a shared vision for achieving climate neutrality by 2030. It brings together 65 organisations that reflect the diversity of local stakeholders: businesses, citizen outreach groups, education and research specialists, youth workers, students, public and semi-public operators. It is hoped that the Agora will expand over time to welcome new local participants and accelerate climate action in Lyon.

The City has tasked this new type of assembly with working together to strengthen everyone's ability to take action, by jointly developing a local contract for the climate – the Lyon 2030 Climate Pact – and drawing up contracts for each Agora member – the Lyon 2030 Cooperation and Commitment Agreements.

The ecosystem created is committed to pooling skills so that we can work together to build a carbon-neutral city by 2030. It also aims to foster new partnerships outside the city and create synergies between those involved in the ecological transition.

The City is preparing to take action

The City is reaching out beyond its boundaries and taking part in regional, national and international initiatives

Playing its part in nationwide efforts to improve public action on climate change

The City is involved in a number of regional, national and international networks. The aim is to encourage cooperation and share innovative ideas and best practice in areas such as mobility, energy transition, social inclusion, digital innovation and sustainable food.

The City also belongs to a number of local authority networks, including the France Urbaine network. This association promotes cooperation between urban areas and represents 2,000 local authorities. Its mission is to provide technical and political input into public decision-making. The City also relies on the technical and methodological expertise of key public bodies such as ADEME and CEREMA (Centre for Studies and Expertise on Risks, the Environment, Mobility and Land Use), as well as specialist associations such as the ALEC, AMORCE (information, experience sharing and support network for communities) and FNCCR (National Federation of Public Service Local Authorities). Lastly, the City is also involved in other networks such as IdealCO and Energy Cities, which foster exchanges between peers. It is also forging special peer-to-peer relationships with other local authorities as part of certain projects.

The challenge is to increase internal awareness of all the structures to which the City belongs or with which it has formed partnerships. The Ecological Transition Task Force is therefore planning to draw up a map showing how these players are linked to the City, along with the departments and coordinators responsible for them.

Creating international synergies on climate issues

At the European level, the City is actively involved in networks that bring together major cities committed to climate action. Since 2008, it has been a signatory to the Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy, and since 2019 a signatory to the Green Cities Accord. In addition to these commitments, it also takes part in international knowledge and experience sharing, especially within the Eurocities community and, more recently, within the European network of 100 smart, climate-neutral cities by 2030.

Taking the lead in removing obstacles to ecological transition

The city aims to play a part at both national and European levels in identifying the obstacles to the deployment of ecological transition initiatives and possible solutions. The topics covered are wide-ranging, including funding mechanisms, legislative and regulatory provisions, and technical and technological issues.

The City plans to frame these messages as part of a dedicated strategy. These messages will be passed on to the appropriate representatives: members of parliament, ministries and government departments, local authorities, the European Commission, and so on.

#

# 5. Keeping a close eye on climate issues: active monitoring, working with public research and innovation, etc.

The climate plan is a collaborative and participatory project, with all departments able to have their say. In the same spirit of collaboration, the City would like national and regional institutions, associations, local professionals and partners, and researchers to be able to give their opinions, with a view to improving the climate plan.

# Building a lasting partnership with the world of research to inform public decision-making

With this in mind, researchers' expertise will be sought in various ways:

Calling on the Greater Lyon's Scientific Council or some of its members to provide expert advice;
Setting up research partnerships to work in depth on certain technical subjects, as well as on change management issues;
Inviting one or more members of the scientific community to take part in key events during the roll-out of the climate plan, to gather their opinions and recommendations.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Providing opportunities for City and academic staff to exchange views on issues in the field and on research.

# Monitoring and forward-looking initiatives to prepare for tomorrow's challenges

More broadly, technical, scientific and regulatory monitoring of the climate must be carried out to keep the City abreast of the latest news, discoveries and innovations. Public policies must be designed in a way that plans ahead for future emergencies. Some of the consequences of climate change are still unknown. This is where partnerships with the world of research come into their own. The forward-looking approach must be strengthened to better anticipate risks.

# Using collective intelligence to challenge the climate plan and spark innovation

Collective intelligence approaches are increasingly being used within the City to jointly develop strategies and actions relating to the climate and ecological transition.

One flagship project that takes this joint approach is the Citizens' Climate Convention for City Staff (3CA), which is about to be implemented. This experimental approach involves around 60 members of staff, randomly selected by lot, to receive training in the challenges of ecological transition so that they can then make proposals and give their views on the ecological transition to the city administration and elected representatives.

In 2022, the City also launched its first participatory budget. This is a tool for involving citizens, enabling everyone to put forward ideas and take part in selecting the winning projects, which the City will then fund and implement. Of the projects selected, 17 are directly related to the ecological transition and nature in the city, and many others are connected to it.
The City is preparing to take action

|  ★★ Instit a conservation culture in the community by consolidating, deploying and sustaining the city's conservation plan | The City of Lyon enacted its energy conservation plan on 11 October 2022. It contains 18 measures pertaining to heating its buildings, best practices and behavioural changes, construction projects and structural measures to reduce energy consumption, and lighting projects. In order to sustain this conservation plan, the issue of international inflation in the Winter of 2022-2023 must be resolved. | 2022-To be continued indefinitely | DGUIT |   |
|  Help city departments determine their energy and water requirements, and how to control their consumption levels | - Formalise the customised support that the city departments and institutions received from the energy and water consultants into some sort of “heading for sobriety !” that lays out a set of standard work methods and an action plan.
Routinely generate dashboards that track consumption at the buildings in question, and share them with contacts for the energy and water consultants and conservation officers so they can see the impact of the actions undertaken and adjust them as needed
Track the conservation plan using monthly consumption data at all levels: cities, top users, activities, etc. By rolling out the energy and water data management app (ENERGIO), access to data on all the buildings and city activities will be easier and more widespread. | 2021-2031 | DGTB | DCCI

|  ★ Involve all users external to city buildings in the energy conservation policies:
• Organise awareness campaigns adapted for the targeted population
• Determine which locations are using the most energy
• Inform city building occupants of their energy use to instil accountability | Raise everyone's awareness (occupants, users, general public) about energy conservation in city buildings
Give occupants the option to track and managed their own energy use and thermostat. When applicable, make external users of the sites in question implement the annual consumption report as part of the Tertiary Sector Decree, or at least for facilities with technical services.

|  ★ Devise, implement and monitor the Zero Landfill Zero Waste Strategy (ZDZG in French) | Better inform city workers and elected officials on waste by offering them training and raising awareness (educational field trips, training in sorting and reducing waste, etc.), conduct an analysis of operations-related waste, make ZDZG part of the ecological transition for city workers. Make the city compliant with regulations in terms of sorting waste at administrative offices and expand the paper recycling contract, establish a biowaste collection contract at places like schools. Track actions being carried out at pilot facilities in terms of sorting and reducing waste, and provide support to management for these actions. | 2024-2025-ongoing | MTE | All departments whose operations generate waste DCP DMG DECA  |
|  ★ - Write a roadmap for work site waste and an operational action plan to be adapted for renovations and construction projects | Provide the city a roadmap and operational action plan to ensure it is compliant with the applicable regulations, as well as cutting down waste and practising circular waste management at the city's renovation and construction sites | 2021-2026 | DGTB DC | DEC DBNV DEU  |
|  ★★ Support better waste management and reduction based on context at facilities for small children (compost, chickens, cloth/biodegradable nappies, etc.) | Approach facilities for small children based on their context and constraints in terms of issues reducing and managing waste. Several trials are being conducted: installing chicken coops or compost bins for organic waste, using washable, compostable nappies to cut down waste generated by disposable nappies, etc. These trials can be expanded and pooled between both city and non-profit day care facilities. How they are deployed will depend on the outcomes of these trials. | 2021-ongoing based on outcomes of the trials | Children's Affairs | MA  |
|  ★★ Reduce single-use plastics at dining facilities | Conduct studies on using stainless steel containers to reduce single-use plastics at school dining halls: - Conduct a study on what containers are currently being used from the main kitchen to the dining halls. - Conduct a study on all viable solutions across the City of Lyon. - Choose a solution to implement across the City of Lyon. The scope for these studies will be from the main kitchen to the student dining halls Eliminate plastic food containers at facilities for small children and gradually replace with a materials like stainless steel, glass, ceramic or Arcoroc glassware: establish a new procurement contract as current tableware is being replaced | 2023-2025 | DE Children's Affairs |   |

|  ★★ Initiate and promote purchasing of second-hand toys and small childcare items, and continue installing donation boxes. | Begin with facilities for small children:
Initiate purchasing of second-hand games and toys: test out a new supply contract that aims to prioritise procurement of refurbished games and toys across all city nurseries
Continue providing places for donating and swapping to encourage reuse. In many nurseries, a vendor is already in place that sets it up and designated parents collect the donations. Beyond the ecological transition aspect, the donation boxes create a social bond and get people involved in the day-to-day life of nurseries.

Once they are installed at facilities for small children, the challenge will be expanding them to the City of Lyon's other facilities and urging our partners like MJC and CS to do the same. | 2022-ongoing | Children's Affairs | MA  |
|  See that the biowaste collection contract is phased in at the city's dining facilities | Through the city's biowaste collection contract, sorting programmes are set up at the source, and food waste is picked up from city facilities.
It has already been implemented at educational and CCAS buildings, but still needs to be expanded to other facilities at issue.

Communicating with city workers and guiding their commutes
Infrastructure and developments
Work organisation
Adapting, optimising and improving work-related travel for city workers, elected official and service providers
Changing and replacing the city fleet
Reducing the carbon footprint for travel | The priority for the City of Lyon's first PDME (city worker travel plan) is both commutes and business trips for city workers.
It is under development and will group actions into four sustainable mobility categories:
Guiding all city workers toward using more sustainable mobility
Creating a stronger sustainable mobility culture
Changing how the community operates to encourage more sustainable mobility
Proactively removing roadblocks to expanding sustainable mobility
The city will achieve this in the following ways:
Equip its key municipal facilities with the infrastructure they need to develop active modes of mobility, i.e., add more parking for active modes of mobility and providing showers and changing rooms at municipal facilities
Continue raising awareness and increasing rollouts for city workers of informational and motivational initiatives on sustainable mobility by competing in annual mobility challenges and training city workers in new mode of mobility
Incorporate mobility issues into the work organisation, i.e., study options for creating new work organisation plans

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Greatly increase the amount of vegetation, particularly in areas that lack green spaces | This action includes street greening within the UNESCO scope, and independent of it through the multi-year annual programme to green the streets and remove impermeable surfacing. Greening programmes and projects should include several criteria: conserve, restore, densify, and build functional greened spaces that foster biodiversity, account for future water requirements, increase ecological corridors, green networks and cooling areas/pathways, remove impermeable hardscaping, and restore soil health | 2020-ongoing | DBNV | Cemeterie s

|  ★★ Provide more education, conservation and value-creation in the region when it comes to biodiversity: Use the community biodiversity atlas and enlist non-profits | Apply the national ABC method that prioritises species groups to inventory Lyon's biodiversity with an emphasis on areas with the most ecological concerns so that changes in populations can be tracked over time
Issue an annual call for projects that support regional non-profits advocating for biodiversity
Longer term: gain a comprehensive view of the region by cross-referencing the data (excluding land owned by the City of Lyon). | 2020-ongoing | DBNV | DGTB

DO  |
|  ★ Continue implementing eco-conscious green space management, while containing the spread of foreign invasive species and vectors of disease | Green spaces are managed in line with the determined uses (classes in nature, life sciences, flowers) An increasing amount of space is being given over to natural spaces and managed on a broader level (mowing spaced out over time). These management methods also have to account for concerns about foreign invasive species and vectors of disease that are prone to spread as the climate heats up, and they require targeted actions. | 2020-ongoing | DBNV

|  ★ Plant more vegetation in playgrounds, nurseries and nearby establishments: prioritise heat islands and give the public access to these places in the Summer in areas that lack public green spaces | A playground greening plan is currently being drawn up for the 2020-2026 term.
It has four objectives:
Plant more vegetation in playgrounds
Partially remove impermeable ground surfaces
Install water games and/or misters
Upgrade the materials
The same type of greening should also be considered at nearby installations (community centres, MJCs, MEs, sport facilities) | 2020-TBD | City of Children Task Force | DE Children's Affairs DBNV DDT Sport DC DGTB  |
|  Continue developing and greening areas around schools (Streets for Kids project) and extend beyond 2026 | Programme to calm and reclaim public spaces around schools and nurseries piloted by the City of Lyon in collaboration with Greater Lyon in view of creating a “city at a child's level,” and overcome long-term environmental, public health, and climate-related challenges.
Provide spaces where everyone can play and walk around
Reclaim public spaces | 2020-2030 | DMU | DE, City of Children Task Force, DEU, DBNV, DSP, DGTB, DPE, DC, COM  |
|  Carry out awareness and educational initiatives on topics like the climate and resilience alongside transitioning playgrounds at nurseries and schools | In an effort to create a stronger bond between nature and the living world, guidance must be provided to the stakeholders (i.e., teachers, city workers specialised in regional elementary schools, and activity leaders – inevitably in collaboration with parents) to help them adapt their working and teaching methods accordingly. The key is to use a pragmatic and calm approach to address matters of organisation, risk management and stakeholder coordination (joint initiatives, peer-to-peer training, etc.). | 2020-TBD | City of Children Task Force | Children's Affairs DE  |
|  Foster connections between children and nature | “Education outside” project for all children's activities: trainings, outdoor facilities, guides, after-school activities, Lyon Nature, outdoor classes, etc.
Outdoor classes are a key strategy of Children's Affairs’ teaching programme to:
Train all city workers at nurseries and early childhood facilities (programme benefits, remove roadblocks to holding class outside, etc.)
Equip nurseries to accommodate outings in any weather: all-weather jumpsuits, rain boots, outdoor naps
Educate the families and survey satisfaction levels: explain at the beginning of the school year and hold a workshop during the year
Measure impacts of the change (upcoming contract) and provide teams educational support when the planted playgrounds are installed
Plans for five outdoor nurseries (at childcare centres), with two scheduled to open in 2025 | Ongoing | Children's Affairs DE DBNV |   |

|  ★★ Resurface playing fields and play areas to reduce pollution: replace with materials that are more sustainable, and add vegetation and shade to mitigate periods of extreme heat. | 1) Replace synthetic surfaces containing SBR fillers (recycled tyres will be banned in 2026) with plastic-based surfaces filled with natural materials, such as cork, olive stones, and maize cob ash.
) Add vegetation to outdoor playing fields and around sport installations.
Collaborating with DBNV to determine which where trees can be planted, first plantings 2023-2024 season. (i.e., orchard at Anatole France and Morin Stadium, Plaine des Jeux, etc.)
Select heat islands to receive horizontal and/or vertical greenery.

|  ★ Incorporate key indicators chosen by residents in a new well-being survey, and then administer it and base city budgetary decisions on the results | The well-being survey aims to become a guide for government initiatives as a tool for determining top-priority community concerns to include in the political agenda, and to open a public discussion about the region's development model. It requires determining the key issues that really matter for residents, aspects that help them "live well" and provide "quality of life." Lastly, the survey should be designed by and with the residents themselves. It is one of three tools in the Mandate Plan for steering city initiatives (the others are the ecological transition scorecard and continuous tracking of the Multi-Year Investment Plan). | 2022-2026 | MEP  |

|  See that all the city's food service contracts are renewed with a criterion on healthy sustainably sourced food: school dining facilities, recreation centres, EAJEs (early childhood care facilities), EHPADs (residential facilities for dependent seniors) and independent living facilities, catering contracts | As each of the food service contracts are renewed for the City of Lyon and the CCAS, they will move toward providing more sustainable food at the city's establishments: greater supply of organic produce with quality labels, fewer animal-derived proteins, more locally sourced food (within a 200 km radius) | 2021-ongoing | City of Children Task Force DCP CCAS Protocol | DE Children's Affairs  |
|  ★★ Expand affordable healthy food for all through the CCAS food service division: canteens, third-party dining venues, community-based food pantries | Support food regimens selected and varied for the most disadvantaged Lyon residents (assist more populations through the food service division/guide them to additional solutions) | 2022-2026 | CCAS |   |
|  ★★ Certify the main kitchen and school dining halls with the Ecocert En Cuisine (in the kitchen) label for sourcing local and seasonal ingredients | The Ecocert En Cuisine label adds value to institutional food service establishments that introduce local, organic and healthy products. The goal is to showcase the quality of the food served in schools by ensuring diners receive meals made from local organic ingredients, and healthy balanced menus that are part of a general health and environment programme The main kitchen and 130 satellite dining facilities are currently applying for Level 2 of the Ecocert En Cuisine label, which will be renewed every year. | 2020-ongoing | DE |   |

|  ★★ Get organisations contracted by the city involved by gradually introducing an environment/social/equality conditionality for receiving grants: shift from non-binding charter and commitments to an ever-strictor conditionality on supporting, training, and equipping organisations | The city subsidises many groups and organisations in a number of areas, such as low-income education, sport, culture, and youth. The aim is to support these organisations and get them working alongside the city promoting greener practices. This has begun by providing charters, tools, and trainings to give the organisations as much support as possible. Conditionality measures will progressively be introduced for receiving grants. An example for sport: Since 2021, clubs have been asked about six aspects of their sustainability programmes (modes of transport, food, purchasing, waste management, educational initiatives, and biodiversity), which weigh on the decision-making process. Via this environment/social/equality conditionality on grants, clubs are also provided free trainings and awareness sessions about sustainability in sport. Example in early childhood: Starting in 2022, advocating for alignment with the city's green plan, routine meetings with partners when ecological transition actions can be implemented, specific indicator in partner activity reports | Sport: 2021-ongoing | Sport DDT DAC Children's Affairs | MTE  |
|  ★★ Undertake a research and development project on bringing in and supporting stakeholders in the low-income education sector and local social development to further their ecological transition and social actions, a driver for empowering individuals and inclusive revitalisation | This objective operationally depends on a research and development project underway in DDT to build more partnerships in the ecological and social transition. It mentions the need to account for a variety of viewpoints from stakeholders in municipal public actions (elected officials, departments, partners in the non-profit sector, vendors, etc.) and then contrast and compare them in discussion forums. | 2023-2026 | DDT | MTE MA  |
|  Support stakeholders in the low-income education sector and local social development to further their ecological transition and social actions, a driver for empowering individuals and inclusive revitalisation | - Support hiring sustainable development officers at organisations (seed money and then operating funding) or by pooling - Expand partnership projects between the city and low-income education organisations under contract | 2024-2026 | DDT | MTE MA  |

|  ★ Open two flagship places for the ecological transition (Neyret site and Chalet du Parc) and host regional programming | The City of Lyon is planning to create a third place for the ecological transition at the Neyret site. Public meetings are being held to co-create the programming with regional players and residents. The actions will take the form of trainings about the ecological transition and the climate, new events, pilot programmes, region-focused workshops, climate plans for the players, support for project development, sharing best practices, and achievement awards.
The plan also includes opening a resilience school (working name) at the Neyret site, a hub for knowledge, trainings, public discussion and experiments aimed at helping build public policies that generate local, tangible and viable solutions for the ecological, community-based and all-inclusive transition. It will rely on a collective of various players: artists, non-profits, researchers, entrepreneurs, elected officials, city workers, and residents.

# Foreword

The Lyon 2030 Climate Contract was the result of work carried out by the Agora, a community of local players coordinated by the municipality. The Agora, which was established in early 2023, has 65 member organisations that are representative of the diversity of local players and are ready to work together to build a shared vision for achieving climate neutrality in the city of Lyon by 2030.

The Agora met five times during the first half of 2023. It worked on sobriety, which it identified as the top priority to successfully take on climate change. The Agora formulated 16 commitments, which are laid out in the city contract, as well as 29 proposed actions for the public authorities.

The contract is a living document and will grow as the Agora’s ongoing work progresses; the ultimate objective is to cover all the challenges involved in achieving climate neutrality.

Each member of the Agora has also drawn up a Lyon 2030 cooperation and commitment agreement that meshes with the collective vision of the city contract. These agreements formalise their commitments and areas of cooperation with the municipality, which are tailored to their unique challenges, their capacity for action, and their core business or activity. In addition to sobriety, other priorities may be addressed.

The city contract will be submitted to the European Commission in the autumn, along with the municipality’s 2023-2030 climate plan. Lyon will then officially receive the label awarded to the cities selected for the European programme 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030.
# Introduction

Human activity is responsible for the changes in the climate that have been observed worldwide in recent decades. Lyon is no exception. The climate in Lyon has already changed, affecting the daily lives of residents, particularly the most vulnerable. Applying climate scenarios for 2070 to Lyon shows that, if nothing changes, it will experience temperatures similar to those in Algiers today.

Taking action for the climate requires adjusting our lifestyles and challenging our relationship to nature and to the planetary boundaries, our social structures, and our public policies. On the city level, drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires inventing new ways to exist as a society and a city and imagining and implementing a more sober future. The city must also adapt to high temperatures, drier ground, and potentially an increase in extreme weather.

To take on this challenge, in 2022, within the framework of a European call for projects, the city of Lyon set the most ambitious goal possible: achieving climate neutrality by 2030. That goal covers all greenhouse gas emissions, both those produced in the Lyon region and “indirect” emissions generated by purchases of goods and services. Municipal operations account for just 5% of the city’s emissions and its policies affect only 20% to 30% of regional emissions¹. Given that limited impact, only a mass collective mobilisation and cooperation among all local players can make the goal of climate neutrality in 2030 achievable: organisations that interface with residents, economic players, teaching and research organisations, youth organisations, students, public and parapublic organisations, and more broadly each and every individual.

The municipality has proposed overhauling the framework for cooperation and action on the climate in Lyon by launching the “Lyon 2030 : inspirons le changement” (Lyon 2030: inspiring change) programme with the aim of spearheading:

a fair ecological transition that meets the needs of Lyon residents;
an ecological transition co-developed with local stakeholders and residents by leveraging all citizen participation processes;
an ecological transition anchored in the Lyonnais identity through the development of an inspiring narrative;
a smart ecological transition that fits into a dynamic of innovation, research, and cooperation, and that incorporates sobriety (e.g. with the “low-tech” approach);
an ecological transition that goes beyond a sector-based approach to draw on local, national, and international networks to replicate and spread its results.

This determined, participatory, innovative approach fits into and complements the different programmes and action frameworks that have already been implemented on the metropolitan, regional, and national levels. It is also part of the revision of the Metropolis of Lyon’s local climate, air, and energy plan (PCAET), which applies to the 50 municipalities in the metropolis, since the Agora’s proposals may be used in the work on updating the PCAET which is slated to start in September 2023.

Lyon’s strong commitment to fighting climate change was recognised on the European level when the city was selected for the 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 programme. This European Commission programme aims to turn 100 European cities into pioneers capable of achieving the goal of climate neutrality, set for 2050 for all European cities, as quickly as possible.

# How is climate neutrality defined?

While there is no generally accepted definition of the concept, climate neutrality is broadly understood as a state of equilibrium between greenhouse gas emissions from human activities and their absorption through natural or human processes. Current definitions highlight both the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the need to offset them with carbon sinks—which can be biological (forests, oceans, etc.) or technological (CO₂ capture and storage)—that absorb more carbon than they emit.

While the City of Lyon’s main focus is a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, some emissions cannot be completely eliminated. Quantifying these irreducible emissions will enable a conversation about potential solutions in the medium term.

# Why has the municipality set a goal of climate neutrality by 2030?

The “Summary for Policymakers” of the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in March 2023 and approved by a delegation of 195 countries, explains it clearly: the 2020s will be a crucial decade in the fight against climate change: “Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health. There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all (...) Actions to limit the increase in temperature to 1.5°C would require a 48% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. (...) The choices and actions implemented in this decade will have impacts now and for thousands of years. (...) Without urgent, effective, and equitable mitigation and adaptation actions, climate change increasingly threatens ecosystems, biodiversity, and the livelihoods, health, and well-being of current and future generations”.

As we face this global crisis, the municipality's objective may appear both laughably small and disproportionately ambitious, since its capacity for action and its influence are limited and conditioned by national, European, and even international frameworks. However, cities currently generate 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. On the scale of a single city, we can already ask the right questions and explore the roadblocks—financial, human, regulatory, organisational, etc.—and identify ways to overcome them, and develop scenarios to achieve this objective. Embodying the potential for transformation and action that lies within every city has tremendous value as an example to emulate.

# B. Greenhouse gas emissions in Lyon

## 1. "Local" greenhouse gas emissions

Greenhouse gas emissions in Lyon include emissions linked to energy consumption in the residential, tertiary, industrial, and transportation sectors in the city, as well as non-energy emissions from agriculture, waste, and certain industrial processes. The total greenhouse gas emissions from all activities in the municipality of Lyon are estimated at 1,253 kt eqCO₂xxiv. These emissions decreased by 203 kt eqCO₂, a 14%¹⁹ drop (figure for France: -14.9%xxv) between 1990 and 2019, while the population increased from 415,500 to 523,000 inhabitantsxxvi. That corresponds to 3.5t per inhabitant in 1990 and 2.4t/cap. in 2019 (figure for France: 4.6 teqCO₂/cap.).

## The main sources of emissions in Lyon in 2019xxvii:

The main sources of local greenhouse gas emissionsxxviii (scopes 1 and 2) are residential and tertiary buildings at 72%, followed by road transportation at 24%. Industrial and agricultural emissions are marginal (4%) and have decreased significantly since the 1990s (-69%).

Total local greenhouse gas emissions by sector (scopes 1 and 2):
495 kt eqCO₂ from residential sources: 40% of emissions, +18% since 1990;
400 kt eqCO₂ from tertiary sources (offices, stores): 32% of emissions, -15% since 1990;
298 kt eqCO₂ from road transportation: 24% of emissions, -22% since 1990;
55 kt eqCO₂ from industry, 4 t eqCO₂ from rail and river transportation, 0.3 kt eqCO₂ from agriculture (4%, -69% since 1990)

Total local greenhouse gas emissions by energy type (scopes 1 and 2): 420 kt e eqCO₂ from petroleum products (39%), 637 kt eqCO₂ from gas (44%), 126 kt eqCO₂ from electricity (12%), 54 kt eqCO₂ from other sources (5%).

A closer look at energy consumption in Lyon (ORCAE data, 2019)

Final local energy consumption: 8,232 GWh, 16 Mwh/cap. in Lyon / 25 Mwh/cap. in France
Total local final energy consumption by energy type: 3,153 GWh of gas (38%), 2 855 GWh of electricity (35%), 1,579 GWh of petroleum products (19%), 646 GWh of other sources (8%)
Share of renewable and recovered energy in final energy consumption: 7% (86% from heating networks and 14% from solar energy)
Total local final energy consumption by sector: 3,439 GWh (42%) for residential, 3,208 GWh (39%) for tertiary, and 1,225 GWh (15%) for road transportation, industry, agriculture, and waste (360 GWh - 4%)

Greenhouse gas emissions: 55 kt eqCO₂ / Greenhouse gas emissions by energy type: 28 kt eqCO₂ from petroleum products (51%), 9 kt eqCO₂ from electricity (16%)

Carbon footprint

In addition to the emissions actually produced in a given geographical area, carbon footprint calculations also include goods and services imported to that area from other regions or countries and exclude emissions from goods and services that are exported. A carbon footprint can thus measure both the greenhouse gas emissions produced in a given area and the emissions linked to products that are imported and consumed.

In 2021, France's per capita carbon footprint was estimated at 8.9 kt eqCO₂. Three-quarters of those emissions are generated by travel, housing, and food. $^{exix}$ With local emissions of 604 M kt eqCO₂ in 2021 (provisional estimate), import-linked emissions made up slightly more than half (51%) of France's carbon footprint.

# Milder winters

Average snow accumulation decreased by  $33~\mathrm{cm}$  (31%) between the period from 1961-1990 and the period from 1991-2020.
The number of days with at least  $30~\mathrm{cm}$  of snow accumulation decreased an average of  $40\%$  between 1961-1990 and 1991-2020 (ORCAE Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes). Snow events that produce accumulation of at least  $10~\mathrm{cm}$  have become increasingly rare. At Lyon-Bron, there were 47 between 1946 and 1975 and just 23 between 1993 and 2022.

# 2. The first signs of climate change which will become more severe in the coming decades

Climate projections for 2100 are now available, offering a better understanding of how Lyon's climate will change in the coming decades $^{\text{exxi}}$ .

The three main scenarios used for these climate projections are:

a scenario in which global warming is stabilised at  $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in 2100: this scenario incorporates a dramatic decrease in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions over the second half of the  $21^{\text{st}}$  century (the "RCP 2.6" scenario);
a scenario with no global climate policy, in which emissions continue to increase after 2100 (the "RCP 8.5" scenario)
an intermediate scenario, which incorporates a climate policy aimed at stabilising greenhouse gas emissions. This scenario generates a higher increase in temperatures than the "RCP 2.6" scenario, followed by stabilisation.

Lyon residents are already experiencing tangible consequences

The consequences of climate change are already visible in Lyon, with an impact on residents' daily lives, the economy, health, local biodiversity, and more. The most vulnerable and fragile residents are the most severely affected. That makes adapting to climate change a crucial challenge: the goal is to ensure that the city can, at its own level, "anticipate and limit the impact of climate change and the associated detrimental effects on socio-economic activities and nature".xxxiv

In other parts of the world, climate change can manifest as extreme weather events and threaten to make some areas uninhabitable. Those phenomena can impact people in Lyon: a drought thousands of kilometres away can influence food prices.

&gt; Intensification of urban heat islands

Temperatures in many city centres are often higher than those in the surrounding rural areas, especially at night. The summer temperatures recorded in central Lyon are frequently 3 to 5 degrees higher than those in the northern Isère or the southern Ain. The difference can exceed 5 degrees during long heat waves with little wind. The intensity of this phenomenon, known as a "heat island", decreases and eventually disappears during the day before reappearing in the evening and particularly overnight, unless rain or strong winds occur.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Map of surface temperatures recorded on 17/07/2017, source: Renard et al.,  $2019^{xxxv}$

Studies by Météo-France show that greening cities reduces the extent of heat islands. $^{xxxvi}$  Residential air conditioning, on the other hand, contributes to worsening the phenomenon (by  $0.25^{\circ}C$  to  $3^{\circ}C$ ) $^{xxxvii}$ .

# &gt; Vulnerable and imbalanced natural ecosystems and degraded water quality

&gt;&gt; Impact on the flow, temperature, and quality of the water in the Rhône and Saône and groundwater aquifers

The average dryweather flow of the Rhône decreased from  $7\%$  to  $13\%$  from upstream (Pougny) to downstream (Beaucaire) between 1960 and 2020xxxviii
The Rhône estuary has warmed by  $2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$  in summer.xxxix
In very hot weather, the lack of precipitation and increased evaporation decrease water levels. That increases the concentration of human-generated pollution (urban, industrial, agricultural, etc.), while warmer water favours the proliferation of fungi and bacteria. These two factors increase the risk of poor water quality.[xi]

&gt;&gt; Impact on flora and fauna

Increased vulnerability of plant species and increased risk of tree death;
Spread of potentially devastating pests like the pine processionary caterpillar.
# &gt; Increased natural risks

Throughout history, the Rhône and Saône have been known for their regular floods. The highest known flood on the Saône is the flood of 1840, which was significantly higher than a hundred-year flood. On the Rhône, the highest known floods are the floods of 1856 and 1928, which were close to the hundred-year flow level.

The impact of climate change on flood risks has not yet been precisely quantified. However, according to the ORECC (regional observatory on the impact of climate change), since the number of days and the intensity of winter rains are likely to increase, floods could be more extensive, with a higher risk of flooding due to run-off and high river levels.[xli] An alternating pattern of drought and intense rain could also increase the risk of landslides.

# &gt; Impact on Lyon residents' health

Excess mortality: in the past five years, mortality increases ranging from  $5.3\%$  to  $25.3\%$  have been observed in the Rhône department during heat waves. xli The 2003 heat wave caused excess mortality of  $80\%$  in Lyonxli
Diseases linked to increased air pollution: ozone pollution peaks mainly occur in summer during calm, hot, sunny anticyclonic periods with little or no wind. Heat waves are thus particularly prone to these phenomena $^{xliy}$ .
Increased risk of allergies: higher temperatures mean that the blooming cycle starts earlier, lengthening the pollination cycle for highly allergenic plants like ragweed. $^{xly}$
Circulation of new diseases carried by invasive species, including the tiger mosquito, which first appeared in Lyon in 2013 and carries viruses like dengue, zika, and chikungunya.

# &gt; Impact on daily life, economic activity, and public services in Lyon

High heat causes poor working conditions: at temperatures above  $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for office work and  $28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for physically demanding jobs, heat can put workers' health at risk $^{xlvi}$
Damage to transportation networks and traffic disruptions
Increased exposure to natural risks and the related damage for the population
Buildings weakened by clay shrinkage/swelling
Decreased water resources that can impact the amount of energy available from dams and nuclear power plants, which need large amounts of water to cool their reactors
Increased energy consumption in summer due to air conditioning systems and their impact (more intense heat islands, risk of leakage of coolants which are major greenhouse gas emitters, etc.)

## D. Fighting and adapting to climate change will require an ambitious trajectory and a systemic vision

### 1. Drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions to achieve climate neutrality

For over thirty years, successive reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—in other words, the international scientific community—have confirmed that human activity is responsible for climate change.

The decade from 2011 to 2020 was the hottest in approximately 125,000 years$^{elvii}$
Global fossil fuel $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions increased 62% between 1990 and 2019$^{elviii}$

Climate change is one of the most concerning symptoms of a world that is breaking the planetary boundaries one by one, putting earth's habitability at risk. The concept of planetary boundaries$^{1}$ defines "a safe and fair operating space for humanity, currently based on nine biophysical processes that, together, regulate the stability of the planet": climate change, the erosion of biodiversity, the disruption of the biogeochemical nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, land system changes, ocean acidification, global water use, stratospheric ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosol loading, introduction of novel entities into the biosphere. These different processes are closely interconnected. The ongoing destabilisation of several of them by human activity is already causing cascading effects. Today, at least six planetary boundaries are considered to have been exceeded.

The goal set by the IPCC is clear: the level of greenhouse gas emissions must be stabilised and then reduced as quickly as possible to return to the residual levels that the planet is capable of absorbing. In other words, we need to aim for climate neutrality and as quickly as possible to remain under the global warming threshold of $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, which is considered critical because it significantly exceeds societies' ability to adapt to the effects of climate change.

The IPCC is also calling for the immediate adoption of ambitious measures to adapt to climate change, particularly in the cities that are home to over half of the global population$^{x5x}$.

An environmental and climate transition that must be accompanied by a social and societal transition

Both the causes and the consequences of the environmental and climate crisis have social implications:
climate change could thrust 69 to 135 million people into poverty worldwide by  $2030^{1}$ ;
The richest  $1\%$  of the global population produces twice as many greenhouse gas emissions as the poorest half of the global population $^{1}$ .

Efforts to fight climate change and achieve a more sustainable society must take into account other objectives, our relationship with the natural world, social issues, international dynamics, etc. These concerns are expressed by the 17 sustainable development goals adopted in 2015 by 193 United Nations member states. The sustainable development goals cover all aspects of development, including education, gender equality, water, energy, consumption and production, the climate, life below water and on land, and peace. The city of Lyon has incorporated them into its public policies.

Ultimately, a systemic approach is required to find solutions to climate issues that simultaneously take into account the planetary boundaries, essential human needs, and the existing interactions between them. With this type of approach, it will be possible to:

make the region more resilient,
anticipate sudden or gradual disruptions thanks to monitoring and forward-looking assessments,
mitigate the impact,
recover and rebound thanks to learning, adaptation, and innovation,
move towards a new state of "dynamic equilibrium" that preserves its functions.

Cities have a central responsibility and a decisive role to play in this global crisis: they cover 3% of the Earth's surface but are home to half of the global population and produce 70% of greenhouse gas emissions. With their dense populations and buildings, they concentrate mobility, logistics, supply, and consumption challenges and polarise economic activity and labour pools. The effects of climate change are amplified in cities.

In France, Lyon is one of the cities most severely affected by climate change. That is why, in 2022, the municipality set itself the goal of achieving climate neutrality within its territory in 2030. It also launched the “Lyon 2030 : inspirons le changement” programme to get local organisations and residents on board.

The city's ambition has been recognised by the European Commission. In April 2022, Lyon was selected to participate in the “100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030” programme, a network for dialogue and experimentation in European cities that aims to tackle the climate challenge by 2030.[iii] Each of the selected cities is expected to start by working with local organisations and involving residents to draft a Climate City Contract that lays out its 2030 commitments, along with an action plan and an investment plan.

# Part 2: Lyon 2030: a climate-neutral city

With the “Lyon 2030 : inspirons le changement” programme, launched in 2022, the city is aspiring to new forms of commitment and cooperation to accelerate the ecological transition. It aims to publicise, synergise, and scale up local initiatives by testing new models of governance and involvement in climate issues and the ecological transition with all local players, including businesses, educational, social, cultural, and sporting organisations, neighbourhood representatives, public agencies, and with residents more generally. To that end, in 2022, it held several meetings that were open to Lyonnais stakeholders with the goal of understanding their perception of and needs related to climate change, and to bring the Lyon 2030 programme to life.

This initial stage also involved city employees, with an increased focus on the municipal assets and public services that they manage. Their efforts included work on overhauling the municipal climate plan to align it with the Greater Lyon climate-air-energy plan.

## A. Public policies overhauled to address the climate emergency

### 1. A new 2023-2030 municipal climate plan with a broader local focus...

The municipality made its initial commitment to the climate in 2010 within the scope of its municipal jurisdiction and its own assets by preparing its first greenhouse gas emissions assessment, which is updated every three years. Its first climate plan was passed in 2013. The plan focused on mitigation, i.e. reducing the greenhouse gas emissions produced by the municipal government. In 2015, the plan was updated and the challenge of adaptation was added. Four years later, a climate air energy 2020-2026 action plan was adopted, but soon had to be enhanced with the adoption of new objectives that were voted in by the new municipal government in 2021 and 2022.

The 2023-2030 climate plan has updated municipal public policy to reflect the goal of climate neutrality. The city's commitment has three major objectives:

drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions from municipal assets and the public services it manages to put the city of a trajectory to achieve climate neutrality by 2030;
working towards adapting the city to handle climate change, and more broadly to prevent the long-term effects and risks of climate change;
raising awareness and empowering city employees and all local stakeholders.

While the new plan is largely based on the previous climate plan—half of the actions will be continued or enhanced—the other half of the plan is made up of new actions.

### 2. ...and that is part of the revision of the metropolis climate-air-energy plan

The city's commitments are consistent with and linked to the current local climate-air-energy plan of the Metropolis of Lyon, which set the goal of a 55% decrease in emissions compared to 1990 by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. The PCAET review process will begin in September 2023 and end in 2025. Lyon, like the 58 other municipalities in the metropolis, will be an active participant in the process, starting in late 2023 with the local diagnosis process and continuing throughout 2024 to define its major outlines and the local action plan.

# B. A new cooperation and action framework for the climate in Lyon

## 1. A new approach developed jointly with local stakeholders

Some 200 local players, including businesses, non-profits, and institutions, responded to the call launched by the municipality in 2022 to discuss a new framework for cooperation and action on the climate in Lyon. The meetings were a rich source of information and proposals: how climate change is perceived in Lyon, what a climate-neutral city in 2030 might be like, how to build on the actions and dynamics that are already in place in Lyon, what can be learned from the experiences of other exemplary cities, what new forms of governance to develop, how to get as many people as possible involved.

And then, if you invited me to speak and contribute to mobilising stakeholders, it's because my town's example shows that it is possible and that a population can get moving and start the transition".

## 2. Climate neutrality: needs, drivers, and roadblocks

Achieving climate neutrality in Lyon is not just a technical and financial challenge: that was the unanimous conclusion reached by the local stakeholders who were asked about their needs, the obstacles to overcome, and the drivers to mobilise to take on the challenge of climate change. Several of these obstacles are considered systemic because they are inherent in the foundations of our economic and social system.

### Public policy and governance

Climate action on the level of the city of Lyon is partially dependent on decisions and regulations applied at other levels: metropolitan, regional, national, European, and international. To be effective, all aspects of climate action (legislative, regulatory, financial, etc.) need to be implemented consistently and at all levels. For example, renovating all residential and tertiary buildings is crucial to achieving climate neutrality. The metropolis has rolled out an ambitious renovation policy that the city supports within its scope, in addition to working on its own properties. However, the implementation of massive renovation programmes is closely correlated with national and European.

More broadly, the stakeholders felt that the State's commitment and climate action are inadequate. They echoed the words of the High Council for the climate in its most recent reports$^{liv}$: France is particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, so its adaptation strategy and measures must be scaled up and enhanced.

The connection between social and climate issues should be clearly defined and widely shared. For example, the metropolis and the city are implementing ambitious policies to reduce emissions from road transportation, particularly with the creation of low emissions zones (LEZ). However, social acceptance of these measures and support for local stakeholders, individuals and businesses alike, are essential. The aid and support measures, such as reduced public transit fares or bonuses for switching to an electric vehicle remain confusing at this stage.

Climate issues have not yet been fully incorporated into forward-looking programmes and local resilience policies.

Local governance has emerged as a key driver to be structured and enhanced.

Taking action

Today, there is no shared understanding (among local governments, residents, businesses, universities, etc.) of the climate neutrality trajectory and how to achieve it in practice.

The need to change the paradigm and work in a cooperative and cross-cutting way was strongly emphasised. Local climate initiatives, of which there are many, are mainly sector-specific and lack clear visibility, which inhibits mass action. For example, some organisations, including companies, non-profits, and government agencies, may take action for the climate (carbon footprint assessment, internal strategy, etc.) in ways that are not linked to the official local approach. Support for local stakeholders and public-private partnerships are sector- or audience-specific, with no comprehensive vision. Another example that highlights the challenge of cross-cutting efforts and cooperation is that of food. Reducing food-related emissions involves not only changing agricultural production methods (more local, less emissions-intensive) but also changing consumer behaviours, at prices that remain affordable for everyone.

The impact of the actions that have already been taken is not always measured and thus remains relatively invisible or poorly publicised, which makes it impossible to expand these programmes or roll them out elsewhere in the city.

Narratives of the ecological transition, social innovation, and participatory democracy

Lyon’s climate narrative—a common, unifying story that everyone can understand—still needs to be consolidated and shared with local organisations and residents: our shared history (where do we come from?), the representation of the actions that have already been undertaken and the results obtained... This vision may already exist at the level of a neighbourhood, an organisation, or more broadly the actions of non-profits or individuals, but it does not have the necessary popularity.

Today, the consumerist narrative dominates, with far-reaching influence on visions, habits, and infrastructure. Quickly getting large numbers of people to engage with a vision of sobriety and the habits that go with it on every level, from consumption to mobility, real estate, and beyond, runs counter to the common ideals of our society. Social and cultural resistance to the idea of human-caused climate change is also a significant factor$^{2v}$.

Moving past this cultural resistance will entail involving as many players as possible.

There is currently no massive communication about the climate or organisational and individual involvement in participatory governance. Broadly speaking, climate-related governance does not yet leave enough space for collective intelligence and individual participation.

Financing the ecological transition and economic models

Public and private financial efforts are currently inadequate to meet our climate commitments and the cost of action compared to the cost of inaction is not well-enough known.

With regard to the investments required to make the ecological transition a reality, focusing on a quick return on investment appears to be incompatible with projects whose economic benefits, when they exist, will only appear in the long term. In many cases, projects have intangible benefits with no direct economic impact: global climate, local cooling, health, etc. Public authorities thus have a key role to play in these investments.

Economic logic and an environment-centric approach have an even more serious clash: all too often, consumption practices put economic players in situations where the cost of an action does not reflect its true impact. In other words, an economical solution is very rarely an environmentally-friendly solution. This situation discourages investment in environmental best practices and produces inequalities and feelings of injustice. More broadly, it challenges the principle of “polluter/payer” and its application.

Monitoring and assessment of climate actions

To date, the existing tools and the data available do not enable detailed motoring of the effects of the climate-related actions that have already been undertaken and the progress made towards achieving climate neutrality. While some practical actions are quantifiable, the majority are forms of incitement and awareness raising, making it difficult to measure their direct impact.

The lack of local data also affects the development of scenarios for achieving climate neutrality.

Given these issues, how can we rethink action and cooperation in Lyon? Local players have proposed five actions, which form the basis of the Lyon 2030 strategy.

C. The basis of the Lyon 2030 strategy

## 1. Objectives

The objectives selected for the Lyon 2030 strategy aim to mobilise local organisations and individuals and get them to take action:

Improve awareness-raising, training, and communication on climate issues for local residents and stakeholders and city employees;
Support, assist, and promote initiatives and projects by local players that aim at climate neutrality, particularly for young people;
Support and assist local organisations, particularly neighbourhood businesses, through their transition;
Offer Lyon 2030 programming: lecture series, events hosted by the city or programme partners;
Support and develop climate resource centres;
Expand cooperation with researchers, particularly by mobilising the metropolis research council and working on information for the general public.
Develop a narrative approach in partnership with Fabrique des Transitions.

## 2. The major components of the programme

### a. Trialling new local climate governance

At the centre of the programme is a new body, the Agora, which brings together local stakeholders. The municipality is committed to collectively developing a shared vision of the road to climate neutrality in 2030 through the Agora. This vision will be laid out in the Lyon 2030 climate contract, which the municipality will publicise extensively at the regional, national, and European levels.

The Agora will enhance public policies by incorporating local players' expectations and better connecting them with private initiatives. The municipal climate plan will progressively be updated to incorporate the Agora's proposed actions and other proposals. The goal is also for the Agora members to inspire each other and their ecosystems with their commitments to the climate and form and strengthen partnerships to accelerate ecological transition projects in Lyon.

This new framework for cooperation and action on the climate fits into the existing regulatory processes in Lyon, particularly the metropolitan climate-air-energy plan. The Agora and the Lyon 2030 programme as a whole will thus contribute to and support certain strategic aspects of the metropolitan plan, although the plan's scope is broader than that of the Agora since it involves all 59 municipalities in Grand Lyon.

## Support from the Metropolis research council

The municipality will request input from the research council formed by the metropolis on the programme and the content of the Lyon 2030 climate contract. The 14 members of the council, who are specialists in the humanities, social sciences, technology, and life sciences, may also be asked to speak to the Agora, to contribute to scientific publications for the general public, or to be involved in lectures or other public events.
# b. Co-developing a vision and a trajectory for climate neutrality

At the national level, the national low carbon strategy (SNBC) has set the objective of climate neutrality by 2050, with a  $55\%$  reduction in emissions compared to 1990 by 2030. This strategy is part of the European Green Deal for 2050 and the Fit for 55.

Several scenarios for achieving climate neutrality in France have been developed by the Ecological Transition Agency (ADEME), the non-profit NegaWatt, and RTE, the electricity distribution network manager. All of these scenarios aim to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, with a focus on sobriety and the massive development of renewable energy. According to the ADEME, "the reduction in demand for energy, which is in turn linked to demand for goods and services, is the key factor in achieving carbon neutrality. This reduction could range from  $23\%$  to  $55\%$  compared to 2015 depending on the scenarios, each of which is based on a different balance between sobriety and energy efficiency". ADEME's scenarios project that "in 2050, more than  $70\%$  of the energy supply will be from renewable sources".

In Lyon, the municipality carried out its first city-level projections for 2030 in 2022. Three scenarios for changes in greenhouse gas emissions within the city were studied, showing that a major change and acceleration will be required to achieve climate neutrality. For example, achieving climate neutrality will require exceeding the regulatory requirements for tertiary buildings, renovating all housing units to meet the BBC (low consumption building) standard by 2030, and significantly decarbonising local mobility and energy.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions trends in Lyon through 2030
|  Sectors / scenarios | Trend-based scenario | Regulatory scenario | Carbon neutrality achievement scenario  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Residential | Renovation of 2,300 housing units per year (70% housing units built before 1970) | Renovation of 8,300 housing units (80% housing units built before 1970) | Renovation of 100% of housing units 2030; 32,800 units/year  |
|  Tertiary | Renovation of 20% of buildings, 75,000 m2/year (tertiary decree) | Renovation of 40% of buildings, 150,000 m2/year (tertiary decree) | Renovation of 40% of buildings, 150,000 m2/year (tertiary decree)  |
|  Mobility | Current trends continue 3% of vehicles replaced with electric vehicles per year | 3% of vehicles replaced with electric vehicles per year Low emissions zone taken into account | 5% of vehicles replaced with electric vehicles per year 2% of personal vehicle use replaced with eco-friendly mobility solutions and 10% with public transit  |
|  Renewable energy sources (thermal) | 16% biogas injected into the gas distribution network Current trend continues for other energy sources | 50% increase in thermal solar energy production and heat recovery (45.42 and 99.17 GWh in additional production per year, respectively) 30% biogas injected into the gas distribution network | 100% increase in thermal solar energy production and heat recovery (90.83 and 198.35 GWh in additional production per year, respectively) 30% biogas injected into the network  |

# Hypotheses used for the scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions trends in Lyon through 2030 (source: City of Lyon)

These initial scenarios, which only take local emissions into account, are based on the assumption that  $20\%$  of greenhouse gas emissions will be offset (the maximum allowed by the European Commission for the "100 Climate-neutral cities by 2030" programme). This hypothesis is not aligned with the Agora and the municipality's goal of reducing emissions and avoiding the use of offsets as much as possible. The scenarios will need to be reworked accordingly.

Other hypotheses need to be shared and refined with the players involved in the Lyon 2030 programme. Feedback and study or experiment results will need to be incorporated to make the climate neutrality scenario more reliable. In particular, the hypotheses will be reviewed to bring them into alignment with those of the metropolitan climate-air-energy plan.

Beyond the purely technical aspects, it is essential to accompany this process with a collective discussion of how to make this scenario a reality: how can we get organisations and individuals onboard? To understand what is possible, share narratives and visions, talk about where we are coming from, what has already been done and what is left to do and how to do it, in 2022 the city signed a partnership with the non-profit Fabrique des Transitions. The objective is to work on a narrative base (what are the dominant/alternative stories) and explore the past/present/future trajectories while also incorporating contradictory narratives. This process can leverage past experiences in Lyon, including the Eau FuturE programme run by the city, which takes the aspirations, expectations, and hopes of residents/users into account $^{5d}$ .
# c. Determining the cost of climate neutrality and developing an appropriate financial strategy.

In France, the national low-carbon strategy (SNBC) aims to achieve climate neutrality in 2050. Several estimates have assessed the associated costs at tens of billions of euros.

The additional public and private investments required across all sectors would be about €66 Bn/year through 2030. The largest investment needs are in tertiary and residential buildings. In this scenario, the public sector (State and local governments) would need to supply €34 Bn/year, while local partners, companies, and individuals would need to contribute €32 Bn/year $^{\text{ivii}}$ .

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Note : le transport maritime et aérien et le secteur des déchets ne sont pas couverts ici, ce qui minore le total des investissements requis.

Another scenario estimates public investment needs at €100 Bn/year, all players combined $^{\text{ivii}}$ . Local governments would need to contribute about €12 Bn/year in investments and €1.5 Bn/year in engineering through 2030. The biggest investments would be in transportation (rail, public transit, bike paths, etc.).

Local governments are currently investing about €5.5 Bn/year. To take on the climate challenge, they would need to increase that budget by €6.5 Bn/year through 2030:  $65\%$  from municipalities and groups of municipalities,  $25\%$  from regions and  $10\%$  from departments $^{\text{lix}}$ .

Locally, during the current term, the city has invested €400 M in the ecological transition within city limits.

At the metropolis level, it would take €1 Bn/year (1.7% of the GDP) to reach climate neutrality in 2050. In Lyon, the investment required to reach climate neutrality in 2030 has not yet been defined, but work on doing so is under way as part of the "100 smart and climate-neutral cities" programme with NetZeroCities. Once the assessment is complete, an appropriate financial strategy will need to be developed with the Lyon 2030 stakeholders.

# Part 3: The Agora: at the heart of the Lyon 2030 programme

One of the central components of the Lyon 2030 programme is the creation of an Agora that rallies local energy, boosts capacity to act, and accelerates climate action.

## A. The make-up and mission of the Agora

The Agora brings together organisation that are representative of local diversity:

Economic players
Organisations that interface with residents (non-profits, etc. including some with a core focus on the ecological transition)
Teaching and research organisations
Youth and student organisations
Public and Parapublic institutions

The first Agora, formed in early 2023, had 65 member organisations.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The Agora has two tasks:

Working together to boost each member's capacity for action by:
jointly developing a local climate contract: the current Lyon 2030 climate contract;
developing a contract for each Agora member organisation: the Lyon 2030 cooperation and commitment agreements. These contracts lay out the vision and individual commitments of the members of the Agora and define their areas of cooperation with the municipality.

The Agora will use these contracts to enhance the collective dynamic and foster partnerships and joint projects;

Serving as a consulting assembly that the city can ask for input on issues related to climate policy and that can issue independent opinions on the subject.

The Agora will expand every year to add new local players and will contribute to platforming new points of view and new expertise. It will hold plenary meetings once or twice per year to review progress on implementation of the contract and launch new projects.

## B. The first Agora in action

Following discussions with local players in 2022, the municipality proposed launching the Agora with a series of five working days in the first half of 2023. This approach had several goals: to give the Agora members the opportunity to get to know each other, to share their climate-related challenges, to lay
the foundations for a shared vision of climate neutrality, to formalise the first collective commitments to achieving that goal, and to discuss how this new assembly should operate.

To join the Agora and participate in this start-up session, each interested organisation had to respond to a call for expression of interest in which it committed to:

attend all five days;
appoint an Agora contact and partner for its organisation;
draft a Lyon 2030 cooperation and commitments agreement to be signed by its director, laying out its commitments and intended for publication.

Of the 90 organisations that responded to the call for expression of interest, which ran through December 2022 and January 2023, 65 were selected on the basis of the following criteria: quality of the application submitted, availability to attend all five initial meetings, and type of organisation, since the goal was to have the Agora be representative of the city's diverse players.

C. The Agora's work

# 1. How is climate change experienced?

While it takes different forms, the impact of climate change is already being felt. The members of the Agora experience its effects both professionally and in their personal lives.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

# Professional impact

Sectors like urban development, construction, landscaping, and logistics must change and adapt their practices;
Heat islands affect many Agora members, particularly those that are open to the public (youth organisations, universities, etc.);
Social issues are exacerbated for those living in run-down housing or experiencing energy insecurity; Agora members who work with these populations must take these issues into account.

# Personal impact

Environmental anxiety is extremely present: fear for the present and for future generations, work-related concerns;
Strong drive to take action both on a personal level and at work.
# 2. What initiatives and projects already exist in Lyon?

Starting with what already exists, promoting it, and looking for synergies: the Agora member organisations have already implemented a broad range of measures to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Examples of initiatives cited by the Agora:

# Corporate initiatives:

Process of becoming a mission-driven company in progress or already complete  $&gt;$  emlyon Business School, La Poste
Participation and involvement in the Convention des entreprises pour le climat (Business Climate Convention, CEC) &gt; Keolis, Hospices Civils de Lyon, ATMO Aura, Centrale Lyon
Corporate social responsibility measures
Energy savings support measures for small independent businesses &gt; the LYON ECO ENERGIE programme, support for waste and packaging reduction with the municipality, awareness-raising on new mobility options with the metropolis, the Eco Défi project by the Chambre des Métiers et de l'Artisanat

# Initiatives to enable a better understanding of the impacts and challenges

Carbon footprint assessments &gt; University of Lyon 3, ICADE, Lyon la Duchère, emlyon
Actions to enhance the debate / raise awareness / train / advance the conversation, internally and/or with organisations' stakeholders: all secondary schools as well as non-profits &gt; Conscience et Impact ecologique, specialised organisations like RESES for students, a guide for sporting organisations from the Office des sports lyonnais, Club Lyon la Duchère

# Fostering cooperation and action by local organisations and individuals

Sustainable mobility for organisations and their stakeholders &gt; Opera
Reflection and discussion of actions to take to adapt the stakeholder's assets or municipal assets &gt; Collectif Végétalisation du Vieux Lyon, ALEC, Grand Lyon habitat, INSA

# 3. What are the keys to successfully achieving climate neutrality?

The discussions among the Agora members revealed the keys to successfully achieving climate neutrality:

The ecological transition: first and foremost about people

Centre people and the living world
Keep positive, desirable, and realistic cohabitation as the target
Reassess the relationship to time, despite the urgency to act

# A clear goal

Define priorities to achieve real breakthroughs, set clear goals
Clarify and quantify the progress achieved and set intermediate goals: "breadcrumbs"
Make decisions through the prism of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions and incorporate other social and environmental concerns
Dare to challenge the idea of growth and reorient the economy towards increased sobriety
Ensure that the commitments made are realistic, particularly for stakeholders like very small businesses

# Mass communication and mobilisation

Communicate broadly about the impact of climate change
Rally the public around exemplary projects and practices
# D. The Agora's three focus areas

To take on the challenge of climate change, the Agora members agreed to work together on three areas.

# 1. Focus Area 1: running the Agora and contributing to its output

While the municipality set up the initial framework for the Agora, it asked the Agora members to consider the long-term operations of this new body. The Agora members discussed initial avenues: contributing resources (time, tools, expertise, spaces), participating in working groups, launching experiments.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

# 2. Focus Area 2: mobilisation and commitments beyond the Agora

Two actions were proposed:

Empowering stakeholders: training/education, commitment
Working and communicating on a vision/imagination
Going through training to share a common knowledge base
Involving/activating Lyon 2030 leaders, individuals, neighbourhoods, businesses, etc.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

# 3. Focus Area 3: priority topics

The Agora identified sobriety as the priority that it wanted to explore in depth in its initial contract. Sobriety is an overarching theme that can be applied to a range of topics, including buildings and mobility (cf. Part 4).

This choice echoes the local greenhouse gas emissions assessment, which showed that residential and tertiary buildings and transportation (part 1) are the most emissions-intensive sectors.
The other challenges highlighted by the Agora are:

&gt; The challenge of adapting to climate change
Topic: Greening
Examples of goals cited by the Agora
Preventing heat islands
Encouraging the development and use of urban orchards
Adapting living environments
Removing artificial surfaces
Topic: Water
Examples of objectives cited by the Agora
Encouraging resource conservation
Raising awareness of the issue: rivers, fountains, watering
Encouraging community and awareness-raising on climate/water issues

&gt; The challenge of changing the economy and consumption
Topic: Employment
Promoting existing local skills
Working on the narrative of the value of certain undervalued jobs (construction, waste management)
Topic: Consumption/purchasing
Challenging needs and practices
Encouraging responsible purchasing
Fostering the regenerative economy
Relocalisation

The Agora may address these other challenges in the future, based on its members' interests and any requests from the municipality. They may also appear in the different members' Lyon 2030 cooperation and commitment agreements.

# Part 4: The goal: "sobriety"

The members of the Agora made a collective decision to prioritise work on sobriety during this initial cycle, with the goal of developing their own collective commitments and proposed actions for the public authorities. They identified sobriety as a priority due to its major impact on greenhouse gas emissions and the fact that everyone can contribute, regardless of their activities or resources.

## A. Sobriety: definition and challenges

Sobriety can be defined as “a determined and organised approach to reducing energy and natural resource consumption through changes in lifestyles, habits, values, standards, behaviours, and organisations. It means reassessing our energy and material use and needs, as well as our vision, our society's energy culture, and our individual and collective organisations.

It is different from energy efficiency, which is limited to technical improvements that reduce energy consumption in a given system (building, vehicle, etc.).

It plays a major role in addressing the climate emergency and ending the use of fossil fuels by serving as a way to negotiate a more equitable distribution of the effort to reduce energy consumption.

Sobriety operates in different timeframes. Emergency sobriety aims to provide a very quick response to a break in the supply of energy, natural resources, water, food, etc. It involves a short timeframe with a high risk of a rebound effect if the measures are seen as "temporary" and developed without concertation. Systemic sobriety, on the other hand, addresses climate, environmental, and social challenges by changing standards, social and technical frameworks (local development, the organisation of time and work, the economic and financial system), and visions. It is developed over a long period and requires planning, concertation, cross-cutting cooperation, and consistence.

B. Sobriety: the Agora's 16 commitments

The Agora's commitments are based on a collective dialogue during which the members proposed topics and discussed their collective capacity for action. The members will implement these commitments based on their resources, scope, and capacity for action.

In addition to these collective commitments, the members of the Agora may present actions that are directly linked to their core activity, their context, their resources, and their audiences in their Lyon 2030 cooperation and commitment agreements.

## Context

The residential and tertiary sectors are the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the city of Lyon (they are the second-largest source in France as a whole, behind transportation). The residential sector accounts for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions (up 18% since 1990), while the tertiary sector (offices and stores) represents 32%, down 15% since 1990.

In the residential sector: the overwhelming majority of housing units are apartments (95%), with just 2.7% single-family homes. A majority of occupants are renters (64% vs. 40% in France), 33% are owners (57% in France), and 2% are housed free of charge. Close to half of existing primary residences were built before 1970, and about 16% were built before 1919ᵇ.

,000 households in Lyon (9%) have been identified as facing housing-related energy insecurity.

Gas accounts for the majority of household energy consumption in Lyon (60%), followed by electricity (29%). The heating and cooling networks represent 6% of consumption. Heating is the top energy consumer (62%), followed by hot water (14%).

The tertiary sector represents 37% of building energy consumption in the city. The vast majority of the 25,950 active employer sites identified by INSEE⁵⁶ in 2020 are in "retail, transportation, or miscellaneous services" (82%), followed by administrative, teaching, health care, and social work organisations (approximately 10%). Just 3% are industrial. Gas accounts for the majority of tertiary sector energy consumption (51%), followed by electricity (33%).
Following the adoption of a national sobriety plan in the autumn of 2022 and the development of an energy sobriety charter by the city of Lyon, many local organisations were interested in getting more involved, and over 240 stores and other businesses signed the charter.

Renovation and improved insulation are also major challenges. Adapting buildings to handle heat is also an increasingly significant concern.

During their discussions of the challenges of building sobriety, the Agora members raised the question of their capacity for action, given their very different profiles and activities. Some own vast swathes of real estate, while others rent small offices. However, taking action on building sobriety is a more accessible step for all organisations than some other initiatives. Sobriety in terms of defining needs (area, occupancy, etc.), the choice of materials (reuse, etc.) and space sharing should also be taken into consideration. With so many different situations, the roadblocks can be legion. The challenges of raising awareness and providing training and education on building sobriety emerged as action drivers; the need to increase cooperation was also highlighted.

## The Agora's commitments

The Agora members ultimately identified three priority commitments, which they could undertake based on their context and their capacity for action:

### 1/ Increase awareness-raising, training, and education about sobriety in buildings

**Qualitative or quantitative objectives:**

Create/share an awareness-raising kit (=shared resource) that organisations can use. Manage, coordinate, and update it
Communicate on the results obtained in terms of decreased consumption (and thus increased sobriety)
More extensive training for ambassadors within structures

**Target:**

Members of an organisation (points 1 and 2)
Organisation-specific personnel (point 3)

**Proposed indicators:**

Number of people using the kit
Consumption reports
Number of people trained

### 2/ Run a collaborative space for stakeholders to foster the emergence of building sobriety projects

**Qualitative or quantitative objectives:**

Space used for co-production (not just information) and facilitation
Space used for meetings between initiative leaders, experts/researchers (resources) and decision-makers/owners
Office hours for support and mediation
Bring projects to decision-makers

**Target: All Agora members**

**Proposed indicators:**

Number of spaces available for this type of mediation
Number of projects displayed/addressed per space

### 3/ Achieve exemplary sobriety in Agora members' buildings

**Qualitative or quantitative objectives:**

Significant share of future renovations use biosourced and/or re-used materials and low-tech systems
Make sites (roof, car park, heating, etc.) available to contribute to local renewable energy production, which can be financed and managed by Lyon residents, and raise their awareness of energy use

1
Target: All Agora members who can take action on their real estate assets, either as owners or by involving their landlord

Proposed indicators:
Percentage of renovations carried out with biosourced and/or reused materials and/or number of projects completed
Percentage of Agora members that have made their site available or persuaded their landlord to take action to contribute to local renewable energy production and awareness-raising for residents

## Examples of roadblocks identified by the Agora
Regulatory standards that prevent seamless use of business premises (insurance, leases, etc.)
Shared management of business premises

## Proposed actions for the public authorities

In addition to its own commitments, the Agora has formulated proposals for actions by the public authorities that have the ability to facilitate building sobriety initiatives:
Align all public policies to support building sobriety: water, greening, eco-renovation, and shared usage
Update local regulations to advance sobriety
Be exemplary in terms of buildings and their surroundings
Draw on usage to raise awareness and offer support
Provide financial support to compensate for inequalities

## Mobility and transportation

### Context

Cars are the biggest culprit in the average French carbon footprint, averaging 2 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$/year (for about 10,000 km driven). Driving on the highway for 2 seconds emits as much carbon as the entire lifecycle of a disposable cup.

In Lyon, 40% of households do not own a vehicle. Cars already account for a very small share of travel (26% of daily trips in 2015) and car use is falling rapidly: 10% drop in kilometres driven in Lyon since 2019, 22% drop in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in the city since 1990. However, most of residents' carbon emissions occur outside the city limits, mainly during leisure travel (weekends, holidays). On a national level, emissions from cars increased 3% between 2021 and 2022.

Just 27% of travel in the metropolis is work-related. Employers with more than 100 employees must implement an employer mobility plan. Just 45 organisations in Lyon have done so to date.

Electric vehicles offer real potential for decarbonisation, but 80% of the new cars sold in 2023 are still thermal. The replacement of existing cars is a slow process and 98.5% of cars in mainland France still run on gas.

When it comes to low-carbon alternatives, cycling is seeing a strong increase in popularity among active adults but is decreasing among its traditional users: children, teens, young adults, and people with low incomes or no driving licence. Cycling has very high potential for urban travel since the average trip within the city of Lyon is just 4 km, about 15 minutes on a bicycle. It is attractive—70% of French people would like to cycle more—but current safety conditions are a roadblock for most people, particularly teens.

Public transit is already largely electric (TGV, TER, metro, tram, trolleybus, etc.) and accounts for a very large share of trips within Lyon. However, the potential for massive roll-outs of new public transit options is severely constrained by the difficulty in financing long-term operating deficits. Passenger revenue covers just 42% of

2
operating costs for the SYTRAL and 27% for TER trains; the shortfall is made up by the mobility contribution (up to 2% of revenue from companies in the metropolis) and subsidies.

Air travel generates fewer total emissions that car travel, since just 11% of people in France use it regularly. However, it is extremely problematic since it enables users to emit several tonnes of CO₂ in just a few hours and for a few hundred euros. There is currently no short-term perspective of decarbonising the industry. Current air travel trends are deeply concerning, with a 36% increase in CO₂ emissions from international flights departing from France between 2021 and 2022.

If we take international aviation and contrails' contributions to radiative forcing into account, transportation emissions in France increased 7% in a single year, compared to 2% if we exclude international aviation.

During their discussions on the links between mobility and sobriety, the Agora members considered how they could take action to limit the need for travel, jointly organise travel to reduce car use, and encourage eco-friendly mobility as employers and in their interactions with the public. In particular, the Agora members whose core activities can lead to or contribute to long-distance travel explored how they could challenge the use of air travel. For example: creating a carbon scholarship for students who apply to travel (modelled on Erasmus scholarships). Their discussions highlighted the importance of this issue. Note that in 2022, close to 8.6 million passengers travelled through the Lyon airport, 66% on international travelⁱ. The idea of developing neighbourhood-level Inter-Employer Mobility Plans, which had already been done several years ago by the Club des enterprises de la Part-Dieu with the support of the metropolis, was also discussed.

## The Agora's commitments

Following these discussions, the Agora members identified two priority commitments on the themes of mobility and transportation, with a goal of sobriety.

## 4/ Systematically implement ambitious, co-developed Employer Mobility Plans (PDMEs)

Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Develop PDMEs using a participative process
Ensure that the highest-impact mobility is better addressed by the PDMEs—commuting or business travel
Make the link to the carbon footprint assessment
Commit to achieving the PRO VELO label
Regularly update the PDME
Work with other members to develop a neighbourhood-level Inter-Employer Mobility Plan

Priority targets: all Agora members

## 5/ Organise and promote travel sharing to encourage greater sobriety

Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Pool everyday and business travel (e.g. local discussion groups for walkers, cycle commuters, etc.)
Avoid some long-distance travel and types of transportation (e.g. air travel)
Launch a conversation about sobriety, communicate about the current status of practices and locally-available mobility alternatives, create new, greener travel habits

Priority targets: all Lyon residents

Proposed indicators:

Number of Agora members with the Pro Vélo label
Number of PDMEs adopted
Changes in the share of different transportation modes for Agora members

## Examples of roadblocks identified by the Agora

Price differences between airline and train tickets;

3
Overnight train options remain inadequate or inconvenient;
Local development challenges;
Feeling of insecurity when cycling;
Lack of communication and relationships among neighbouring employers to address mobility

## Proposed actions for the public authorities

Adapt the city—the spaces where people live—to the rhythm of life (all users): encourage walking, encourage parents not to drop their children off in cars, educate cyclists on the rules of the road, improve pedestrian signage, increase visibility for sheltered paths, inform and educate the public about sharing the road etc.
Encourage alternatives to flying with financial and tax incentives and a new narrative
Stiffen parking restrictions and make alternatives to car use easier for apartment buildings

## Urban Logistics

### Context

Shipping generates about half the emissions of passenger transportation. Most emissions are generated on the road, outside urban areas. In 2020, road transportation accounted for 88.4% of land-based transportation (excluding oil pipelines); rail transportation represented 9.6% and river shipping made up 2%. Rail shipping is severely handicapped by the inadequate rail infrastructure capacity around all metropolitan areas, particularly Lyon (saturated north-south lines). River shipping has large reserve capacities but a less extensive network. Both rail and river shipping are penalised by the fact that warehouses are currently built near highways, rather than waterways or rail lines.

Some 4.5 million square metres of space are dedicated to logistics in the Lyon urban area. Warehouses are often used as an interface between long-distance logistics and the "urban" logistics that serve Lyon. While urban logistics cover short distances, they represent up to a third of shipping costs.

Lyon and Villeurbanne have a total of 6,000 logistics jobs, 28% of the logistics jobs in the metropolis, particularly due to large La Poste sites (8 sites with more than 100 employees) and SNCF Réseau sites (9 sites). New projects exclusively focused on urban logistics are currently being developed (Port Edouard Heriot, the Lyon Perrache Urban Distribution Centre). The cycle logistics sector is expanding fast and theoretically offers a more efficient, cost-effective solution than truck deliveries. Cycle logistics companies have delivered 700,000 packages in the Metropolis of Lyon—equivalent to 550,000 km for a motor vehicle—since April 2022 (see appendix 2).

The Agora members have identified logistics as a key area for achieving climate neutrality. During their discussions, they explored the extent to which consumption and flows can be reduced at the source while maintaining local services and meeting the needs of vulnerable residents. They also discussed how e-commerce activities could be distinguished from local and small independent businesses' activities. Ensuring that social issues are taken into account in this sector appears to be essential. Participating in the dialogue initiatives and programmes led by local governments and developing last-mile logistics and the capacity to pool resources and experiment were mentioned as major action drivers.

### The Agora's commitments

Following these discussions, the members of the Agora identified two priority commitments, which they could undertake based on their core activities and their scope of action on urban logistics.

5

# 6/ Make commitments to cooperation on sustainable logistics with the metropolis and the City

## Qualitative or quantitative objectives

Take part in developing the logistics plan of the Metropolis of Lyon
Map existing and desired logistics flows, develop a flow reduction capacity assessment
Address needs for fast emergency service logistics
Work on resources and tools for cycle logistics specialists
Explore transportation sharing (real estate, vehicles, equipment, materials, etc.)
Highlight exemplary initiatives (delivery sharing service, free cargo bike stations, etc.)

Target: intermediate and service flows; cycle logistics

# 7/ Optimise organisations' logistics flows

## Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Share tools, workspaces, and equipment among organisations using a platform
Test a cargo bike station with a view to developing this service (location, business model, training)
Draw up a charter for a shared framework of rules

## Examples of roadblocks identified by the Agora

Economic heft of major online retail and delivery businesses
Social status of delivery drivers / increased insecurity but also responsibility for service providers / order issuers
Large number of players and no single point of contact (particularly for last mile logistics)
Some logistics platforms are underused

## Proposed actions for the public authorities

Develop a logistics scheme and a delivery/logistics/employment charter and status for a regulatory framework shared by all
Work on pooling transportation / real estate (logistics centres, river relay platforms, experiments by different players - LPA, Keolis, etc.) / vehicles (bus and tram at off-peak hours, utility vehicle sharing)
Foster experimentation and logistical cooperation

# Sustainable Water Management

## Context

Water is an essential common good that is often seen as abundant or even infinite. The impact of climate change, which is already making itself felt, is dramatically altering the water cycle and our relationship to this resource. Droughts are becoming both more common and more intense, with correspondingly more serious impacts on the environment and human activities. The average temperature of the phreatic zone and the Rhône have already increased by an average of $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ over the past 30 years. By 2050, the flow of the

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Rhône at its lowest ebb could decrease by 30%. By the end of the century, its average flow could be halved. [xii] Torrential rains will also become more frequent, leading to increased risks of flooding, mudslides, and landslides. The increasing vulnerability of this resource is a reminder of the urgent need for sustainable water management at all levels and across all uses. On the national level, the Observatoire des services publics d'eau et d'assainissement (water and sanitation utilities observatory) estimated in 2020 that French residents used an average of 149 litres of drinking water per day, for domestic consumption of 54.3 m³ per inhabitant and per year [xiv].

During the Agora's discussions on sustainable water management, ensuring that everyone is committed to sobriety in all uses of water emerged as the major cross-cutting challenge.

The risk of increased conflicts between different uses of water as it becomes an increasingly rare resource were also highlighted: the social challenge of ensuring universal drinking water access and the challenge of an equitable distribution of resources and risks between the upstream and downstream areas of water courses, particularly reconciling the needs of transportation, energy (nuclear and hydroelectric), biodiversity, and ecosystem preservation on a river like the Rhône. These potential conflicts will require political choices on different levels to protect the general interest over the long term. The members highlighted the importance of better arbitrating between uses and raised the question of prioritising resource allocation. In that vein, they included the objective of better sharing this common good by incorporating social justice.

The members also raised the question of the impact of decreased flows in water courses and rising water temperatures on their use as a buffer for output from water treatment and industrial plants and nuclear power plant cooling.

Finally, in urban areas, water is one of the keys to cooling and to adapting to climate change, since it is essential for greening. Plant species must be selected and optimised based on their water needs; another priority is providing cooling spaces such as fountains and swimming areas.

## The Agora's commitments

Following these discussions, the Agora members identified a priority commitment on the themes of sustainable water management, with a goal of sobriety.

## 8/Audit, survey, and share Agora members' water/awareness-raising/training practices

Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Analysis by each structure of its relationship to water (low-flow equipment, eco-friendly habits, processes that use water, virtual water in purchasing and in its business impact, etc.).
Establish a shared best practice guide
Train leaders (e.g. the fresque de l'eau workshop) to raise awareness inside and outside the organisation and bring in existing organisations that can provide support
Run staff awareness-raising/training campaigns on job-specific issues and everyday habits
Ramp up the skills of awareness-raising workshop leaders
Invite the members of the Agora to attend Metropolis of Lyon's water users' assembly
Promote greening and impervious surface removal on Agora members' sites

Target: All Agora members

Proposed indicators:

Number of members that have initiated actions (to be monitored at Agora meetings)
Number of Agora members that have a water leader who is responsible for auditing and monitoring; if possible, they should have undergone awareness-raising/training
Annual meeting of the Agora water contacts

## Examples of roadblocks identified by the Agora

Regulatory: reuse of non-drinking water and experimentation
Sociological: reuse of treated water for watering
Societal: need to change society's vision of water and reasonable use of water (private pools, watering, etc.)
Technical: existing buildings and impervious surfaces to be upgraded, no local water agency to support or implement initiatives

These roadblocks will require a strong commitment from the public authorities on different levels to eliminate them, accelerate existing greening and impervious surface removal programmes, and more broadly to encourage action (PLUH, subsidies, etc.).

## Proposed actions for the public authorities

Remove obstacles to water recycling in buildings (rainwater/grey water - regulatory obstacles) and encourage implementation (PLUH, subsidies, etc.)
Accelerate support for impervious surface removal and greening

## Responsible Digital Technology

### Context

The virtualisation enabled by digital services creates the illusion of a low environmental impact. However, the increase in tools and services has led to a significant rise in the pressure on the environment and natural resources (water and rare earths).

In France, digital technology and services represent 2.5% of greenhouse gas emissions and 10% of electricity consumption. Their impact is largely concentrated in the digital device manufacturing phase, which accounts for 78% of the sector's carbon footprint: manufacturing of televisions, computers, tablets, connected devices, and smartphones, as well as the creation of networks and data centres. 20 million tonnes of digital waste are produced every year in France.

Inset: Greenhouse gas emissions by device type: desktop computer 169 kg eqCO₂/device • laptop computer 156 kg eqCO₂/device • smartphone - traditional 16.5 kg eqCO₂/device

According to the ADEME, if current trends continue unchecked, the carbon footprint of digital technology in France could grow from 17 to 25 Mt eqCO₂ between 2020 and 2030 due to the increase in the number of devices. Rising usage and growing data traffic would require building more data centres, driving increased electricity consumption.

Several initiatives exist on the municipal level: purchasing refurbished equipment by default (computers, screens, smartphones, copiers); donating end-of-life devices to Emmaüs Connect to be refurbished and sold at equitable prices; installing Linux on childcare centre computers, which have limited use, to increase their useful life.

During their discussions, several members highlighted the need to take into account pollution linked to digital technology, particularly device production and digital data storage. Members also raised the importance of extending the lifespan of IT equipment in the Lyon area. Several options were explored, including setting quotas for device refurbishment in the city.

For the Agora, the challenges of digital technology mainly centre on the need for sobriety in choosing and using devices, e.g. limiting the number of devices and extending their useful life and focusing on selecting and implementing eco-designed digital services (websites, applications).

### The Agora's commitments

Following their discussions, the members identified a priority commitment which they could undertake:
8

# 9/ Implement a best practice framework for Agora members to make a joint commitment to a shared framework for responsible digital technology use

Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Charter, support, and training on new responsible digital technology practices (change resistance)

Target: Initially the members of the Agora; later to be extended by serving as a local example (partners, clients, other local organisations)

Proposed indicators:

A survey and life cycle analysis of IT equipment
Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
Percentage of devices refurbished
Training and support programmes
Measurement of the useful life of equipment

# Examples of roadblocks identified by the Agora

The need to raise awareness and provide support on these topics: fresque du numérique workshop, training, feedback, etc.
Software obsolescence, which accelerates equipment turnover as performance becomes inadequate. This roadblock can be eliminated by using certain software and open-source solutions; however these solutions in turn encounter other roadblocks linked to user comfort and high maintenance costs.

# Proposed actions for the public authorities

Issue broad regulations to extend the useful life of government IT equipment;
Act on all levels to incite organisations to refurbish equipment;
Cultivate societal responsibility, support, and education on sober and responsible digital technology use (screen access, logging off).

# Promotion of undervalued essential jobs

## Context

"Jobs in all sectors will be affected by the low-carbon transformation. However, this impact will be highly heterogeneous, and in some cases will be massive"³. Transforming our society to achieve climate neutrality will necessarily impact the labour market. Some jobs will disappear because they will be irrelevant while others will become essential.

Some essential jobs are undervalued because they are seen as unattractive. The most essential jobs are often the lowest-paid and the least secure: jobs in agriculture, logistics (trucking, etc.), medical services, waste management, water, energy, etc. There is no consensus on the definition of essential or undervalued jobs, so no local statistics on these sectors are available⁴. When it comes to "green" jobs, there are about 150,000 in France according to the ADEME. For the Metropolis of Lyon, that figure is estimated at several thousand jobs, based on local figures from the French unemployment office Pôle Emploi (in 2022, there were about 1,000 water-related jobs and about 350 waste-related jobs).

During their discussions, the Agora members emphasised that these "undervalued" jobs require better support, pay, and publicity. That also means raising awareness, first and foremost among the people who do those jobs, to show them that everyone can be a part of the ecological transition and that they play an important role in our societies. Their importance for community life in complex systems should be centred.

⁴ Source: Maison Métropolitaine d'Insertion pour l'Emploi
The Agora members discussed the importance of promoting these essential jobs to make them more meaningful and attractive by changing the narrative and society's vision of them (e.g. personal stories, meetings with pupils, etc.). The need to involve all trades and professions in the conversation about the ecological transition also emerged, both within each Agora member organisation and in the Agora itself.

## The Agora's commitments

Following these discussions, the Agora members identified a priority commitment to promoting undervalued essential jobs:

### 10/ Offer all workers (including those in undervalued roles) an opportunity to be involved in the transition and promote them

**Qualitative or quantitative objectives:**

Have organisational transition plans that identify the role of each trade and profession in achieving the objective
Promote undervalued essential jobs through internal and external communications
Develop policies and transition plans with each trade and profession that can be involved
Include the connection between the position and the transition objectives in each job description

**Target: All Agora members**

**Proposed indicators:**

Number of people reached by communications
Monitor and share each member's progress (annually?)
Content of plans / narrative of what has been done

## Examples of roadblocks identified by the Agora

Some jobs will disappear because they will no longer be needed. Other jobs will face hiring shortages even though they are essential.
The most essential jobs are often the lowest-paid and the least secure: jobs in agriculture, logistics (trucking, etc.), medical services, waste management, water, energy, etc.

## Proposed actions for the public authorities

To take on these challenges, the members of the Agora have identified the following actions that the City could take to promote undervalued essential jobs:

Create a municipal collective agreement for essential jobs (this could take the form of a charter in which municipalities including Lyon undertake to support 100 jobs identified as essential, either by promoting them or by increasing their visibility and reminding the public that they are essential in today's society and for the ecological transition)
Promote best practices

## Communications in support of sobriety

### Context

While greenhouse gas emissions linked to advertising are difficult to identify at the city level, advertising does have a real impact on contemporary society since it strongly influences our lifestyles and drives consumption. Advertising is omnipresent on TV, on social media, and in public spaces. In Lyon in particular, public spaces are saturated with messages that are often in direct conflict with the ecological transition. There are many different forms of advertising: billboards, screens, and banners. The Metropolis of Lyon has 580 billboards and 485 information displays. Store façades can also be advertising spaces.
During their discussions, the Agora members raised the importance of sober, responsible communications. They also emphasised the importance of deconstructing the existing advertising mechanisms or challenging the model of consumption based on intense advertising. They mentioned the relevance of distinguishing between different forms of publicity: public and general interest information and commercial information. The members suggested that the latter could be limited in public spaces in order to ensure greater visibility for advertisers with a proven CSR and environmental strategy. Doing so would entail regulating advertising.

Responsible communication must be based on sustainable channels and resources and guide users toward responsible practices.

## The Agora's commitments

Following these discussions, the Agora members identified two priority commitments on the theme of communicating to support sobriety.

## Commitment 11/ Raise awareness of and provide information, training, and/or education on a culture that is critical of advertising mechanisms and on sober, responsible lifestyles

Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Internal objective for each Agora member: one action per year to reach all its stakeholders through 2030;
For the Agora as a whole: create a shared foundation and definition for all Agora members and develop resource sharing;
Externally: run a joint Agora campaign to promote sobriety as attractive (modelled on lobbying groups)

Target: All Agora members

Proposed indicators:

Number of actions taken
Number of people reached
Feedback (showing that the communication initiatives effectively encouraged sobriety)

## Commitment 12/ Implement sober and responsible internal/external communications practices

Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Ramp up teams' skills
Increase inclusion and accessibility
Reduce the impact of habits and practices (equipment, purchasing, consumption, software)

Target: All Agora members

Proposed indicators:

Training (Number of people trained)
Carbon impact measurement

## Examples of roadblocks identified by the Agora

Advertising contracts are very long-term

## Proposed actions for the public authorities

Ban lighted signs and advertising in store windows, public spaces, and the metro
Create a public advertising agency to replace the market-based approach with a public interest-based approach
Redefine advertising contracts to balance the ratio of useful/commercial advertising

Consumption and waste

## Context

The residential, tertiary, and transportation sectors are the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in Lyon. However, taking the carbon footprint into account, consumption (food, purchases of goods and services, healthcare, housing, etc.) accounts for a large share of emissions. At the end of the chain, waste processing related activities generate about 4% of greenhouse gas emissions nationwide. The way that Lyon residents consume products and generate waste also impacts their health, their quality of life, and ecosystems, in addition to the impact on climate change.

On average, residents of the Lyon region⁵ (which is larger than the city) spend €13,082 per year on food and other purchases. Large stores remain the biggest distribution channel for food by a large margin. Their market share stood at 62% in Lyon and Villeurbanne in 2022. Changing production and consumption habits have doubled the amount of household waste generated over the past 50 years. If nothing changes, global waste production will increase by a further 70% by 2050. In the Lyon region, more than a kilogramme of waste per inhabitant is collected every day (387 kg/year/cap. in 2020; household and similar waste).

Consumption habits are changing, however: 56% of households in the Lyon region are buying more local products, 42% choose items Made in France, and 23% are buying more second-hand goods. 41% of Lyon region households say that they are shopping more at local stores. In Lyon and Villeurbanne, 26% of consumers say they buy bulk goods. In Lyon, local agricultural products make up 4.6% of what residents eat. At the same time, 27% of Lyon residents use delivery for leisure meals.

Lyon-based retailers are taking on these challenges: 240 organisations have earned the “Lyon Ville Equitable et durable” (Lyon, an equitable and sustainable city, LVED) label and 106 hold the “Fabriqué à Lyon” (Made in Lyon) label, both of which are awarded by the city government. Many organisations, small retailers, and even some neighbourhoods have also committed to ambitious waste reduction programmes. Examples include the quartier Zéro déchet (zero waste neighbourhood) programme in the 9th arrondissement or the Mandala project in the Etats-Unis district of the 8th arrondissement.

With regard to the objective of sobriety, the Agora members identified several challenges, particularly that of being aware of each organisation’s activities to create synergies. The members also identified the challenge of developing a responsible purchasing culture; there is a need for contacts with city services to better understand the issues related to the SPASER (socially and economically responsible public purchasing promotion) programme and make purchasing seamless. The members also expressed the importance of not focusing on exclusively on recycling and refurbishment to the exclusion of talking about reducing waste production. They also identified a desire for synergies with the metropolis. Finally, the Agora members agreed on the major challenge of the circular economy: making today’s waste the resources of the future.

## The Agora's commitments

Following their discussions, the members identified a priority commitment which they could undertake.

### Commitment 13/ Develop a zero waste model by 2030

Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Eliminate single-use products
Invest part of the budget in sustainable, sober resources, material, and services from the circular economy
Create a connection between biowaste collection, energy savings, and green space renovation
Eliminate waste and incineration and potentially organisations’ mixed waste bins
Audit and map the flows of waste from Agora member organisations to make one organisation’s waste another organisation’s resources: turn a conversation about waste into a conversation about resources

⁵ Source: 11th Lyon region consumer survey 2022
Experiment and create governance based on this model

Targets: all Agora members

## Commitment 14/ Promote responsible consumption and purchasing

Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Create a network of the players engaged in the process and promote their actions, particularly by creating a directory of professionals, based on labels (e.g. LVED)
Create a responsible purchasing repository based on the model of the municipal SPASER
Raise awareness and provide training and support to help the Agora member organisations roll out responsible purchasing policies
Develop a responsible purchasing plan for each organisation (examine the need, share, buy refurbished, choose local products, etc.)

Target: Train the Agora members and organisations that need to make responsible purchases

Consumers, on the responsible purchasing side

Proposed indicators:

Percentage of local purchases made by companies and consumers
Number of organisations that receive the LVED label
Percentage increase in use of La Gonette

## Examples of roadblocks identified by the Agora

It is hard for professionals to purchase food locally due to cost, packaging, and product traceability issues.
Regulatory constraints also make local consumption difficult.
Farmers know how to farm but not how to handle the logistics or respond to public-sector calls to tender.

## Proposed actions for the public authorities

Develop systems like labels, maps, and/or a directory to make it easier to identify and find local producers/businesses
Set up programmes run 50/50 by the municipality and local organisations to encourage new local consumption initiatives
Provide support to help farmers respond to calls for projects and public-sector calls to tender
Train and support the general public and organisations

## Cooperation and sharing

### Context

Cooperation and sharing have been identified as major cross-cutting drivers to encourage sobriety. The non-profit NégàWatt has evoked a definition of "sociable" or "cooperative" sobriety which is based on sharing equipment and facilities: car sharing, shared laundry in apartment buildings, cohabitation in housing and work spaces, etc.⁶.

During the discussions, several potential avenues for action at the Agora level were raised: cooperation among members on specific projects; mobilising the Agora so support and/or facilitate the emergence of neighbourhood

⁶ Source: NégàWatt (2016), “Qu’est-ce que la sobriété ?”, Fil d’argent, n° 5, winter, p. 11-13.
cooperation and sharing initiatives; the possibility for the Agora to work with the municipality to assess how certain measures could boost or encourage cooperation rather than competition among local stakeholders (e.g. calls for projects).

## The Agora's commitment:

The members' discussion on sobriety led to one commitment:

### 15/ Share and act together

Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Share experiences with the projects that the organisations run together -&gt; create a project bank
Revisit approaches to action to transition from individual to collective action (better cooperation) when an idea for a new project emerges

Proposed indicators:

Number of Agora members I worked with during the year;
Number of best practices shared during the year

### Examples of roadblocks identified by the Agora

Today, cooperation is often very complicated and complex due to procedures. E.g. calls for projects that put organisations into competition with each other
Difficulty of measuring cooperation

### Proposed actions for the public authorities

## Imagining the Future

### Context

The question of narratives emerged repeatedly throughout the Agora's work during the first half of 2023. How can we move beyond a technical approach when talking about the climate? How can we can get local stakeholders and individuals on board? How can we tell a story or stories about climate action? How can we imagine attractive carbon-neutral futures?

During their discussions in April and June, the Agora members emphasised that sobriety is not just about a narrative. It is also a question of material capacity. Not everyone has the economic ability to undertake a sobriety strategy. A narrative-based approach does not necessarily need to come before action; it should accompany action and serve as a tool to further change. Sharing common alternative narratives is also a driver for cooperation and co-development. The members of the Agora highlighted the importance of updating and adopting a shared vocabulary and promoting topical real-world examples of narratives about sobriety.

The Agora members also explored potential narratives about sobriety. These narratives could be articulated around the saying "fewer possessions, more connections" and focus on all the benefits of sobriety: less consumption but more sharing, less pollution, more well-being, more quiet, a greater connection to nature, less waste, more solidarity. That will entail articulating a vision of sobriety, e.g. by imagining someone returning to Lyon after many years' absence and using all five senses to remember what the city was like in contrast to how it is now: "I see a city where children are playing in a calm, quiet street under the gaze of seniors who are chatting in the shade of the plane trees, which fill the air with their fragrance, I hear the breeze rustling in their branches, I can feel the damp earth of the park and taste the first cherries of the season; I remember a city where summers were sweltering, where loud, aggressive cars dominated everything with their screeching tires and horns, where

plastic bags flapped on the asphalt, where everything reeked of diesel, and where the streets were bare of shade from trees and the sound of children's laughter".

## The Agora's commitments

Following their discussions, the members identified a priority commitment for all members, as well as proposed actions for the public authorities.

## 16/ Involve the Agora in the development of the narrative of a desirable city for 2030, focused on sobriety

Qualitative or quantitative objectives:

Tell the story of the Agora to develop skills individually
E.g. A Lyon resident leaves the city in a hot air balloon and returns to Lyon in 2030, rediscovering his city: "I remember what it was like", "I see what the city of Lyon has become"—focused on sobriety—and using all five senses.
Topical narratives (food, greening) and practical examples (situations from everyday life)

Targets: all Agora members, then open it up to everyone

## Examples of roadblocks identified by the Agora

The power of narratives that support the consumer society that has existed for decades

## Proposed actions for the public authorities

Take control of the narratives and propose related practical actions (with the municipality and in partnership with the metropolis)
Mobilise local structures to join the fight for a new vision

## E. An individual commitment: the Lyon 2030 cooperation and commitment agreements

The members of the Agora are committed to contributing to enhancing and implementing the shared vision of the Lyon 2030 climate contract. The Lyon 2030 cooperation and commitment agreements are aligned with the city contract to formalise the vision and commitments of each member of the Agora, as well as their areas for cooperation with the municipality through 2030. The commitments laid out in these agreements include both enhancements of existing actions and new actions that will contribute to the commitment areas defined in the contract.

Under these agreements, the municipality undertakes to:

facilitate the interface between local players and access to existing climate/ecological transition resources;
actively work to identify financing and support the development of projects that involve Agora members based on the priorities and actions identified in the Lyon 2030 climate contract;
broadly promote the organisation's commitments;
help the organisation assess the climate impact of its actions;
on the level of its own skills and assets, enhance its climate plan, incorporate feedback from the Lyon 2030 climate contract, and promote partnerships with the members of the Agora.

Appendix 1 – Glossary

climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030: A European programme launched in 2022 that aims to establish 100 European cities as pioneering centres for experimentation and innovation that will be able to inspire other European cities and make it easier for them to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

Adaptation: Refers to actions to prepare for and manage the consequences of global warming

Mitigation: Refers to actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and preserve carbon sinks with the goal of diminishing the effects of human activity on global warming.

Carbon budget: International budget for greenhouse gas emissions estimated by the IPCC. It is estimated at 500  $\mathrm{GtCO_2}$  to limit global warming to  $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  by 2100.

Covenant of Mayors: The leading European movement that brings together local and regional authorities around a voluntary commitment to improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energies https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89nergie_renouvelable within their remit.

Heat wave: A meteorological episode in which very high daytime and overnight temperatures persist for at least three consecutive days. In Lyon, the thresholds are  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  overnight and  $34^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  during the day.

eqCO.- carbon equivalent: A single unit of measurement has been adopted to compare different greenhouse gases. CO.equivalent can be expressed in t, kg, g, etc. It takes into account the warming potential of different gases over a given period of time.

IPCC - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: A body tasked with evaluating the state of knowledge of climate change, its causes, and its impact. It also identifies possibilities to limit the scale of climate change. Its research is central to international dialogue and agreements.

Urban heat island: an urban area, often in the city centre, marked by high air and surface temperatures compared to outlying areas, particularly at night.

Planetary boundaries: 9 planetary boundaries have been identified as limits that must not be crossed to maintain the equilibrium of the Earth system. Each limit corresponds to a critical threshold beyond which all life on Earth faces the risk of global collapse.

Carbon neutrality (or climate neutrality): A state of equilibrium between greenhouse gas emissions from human activities and their absorption through natural or human processes.

SDG - Sustainable Development Goals The 17 Sustainable Development Goals defined in 2015 by the United Nations are topical categories of urgent global political issues to be incorporated into the public policies of the international community.

ORCAE - Regional Climate, Air, and Energy Observatory Supports the development of public policies and diagnoses linked to climate-air-energy issues. It is also positioned as a resource and information centre and a space for dialogue and network building among organisations that are active on these issues.

5
Resilience: the ability of a system to return to the structures and functions of its benchmark state following a disruption.

Scope: In the case of carbon footprint assessments, refers to the scope within which emissions are quantified. Emissions are divided into scopes 1, 2, and 3 depending on whether they are direct (scope 1), linked to energy consumption (scope 2), or all other indirect emissions (scope 3).

lxi If it is impossible to achieve "good status" for bodies of water (in compliance with the framework directive on water 2000/60/CE) or if, based on a cost-benefit analysis, the measures required to achieve good status for aquatic environments have a disproportionate cost, a target that is less strict than good status may be defined. The difference between this objective and good status must be as small as possible and apply only to a limited number of criteria.

# Greenhouse gas emissions: baseline inventory and scenarios to 2030

Courtesy translation

## Part 1 - Baseline inventory of greenhouse gas emissions (Module A-1)

### A. Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

In order to establish the baseline level of GHG emissions and determine the gap between emissions and carbon neutrality, and also to build its action plan, the City of Lyon has completed the data requested below.

These datas specified below are based mainly on that produced by the Auvergne Rhône Alpes Regional Climate, Air and Energy Observatory (ORCAE). Created in 2018 through the merger of several observatories specialised in air, energy, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the ORCAE observatory produces indicators that meet regulatory requirements : pollutant concentrations, population exposure, energy consumption and production, greenhouse gas emissions, annual carbon absorption in the region, heat networks, etc;

### B. Methodology and definition of sectors

The consumption and emissions recorded below correspond to an emissions inventory based solely on scopes 1 and 2 for all of the region's activities. The required scope 3 datas which covers waste management and the treatment of wastewater generated by the region, has been estimated separately.

The emissions inventory includes :

Carbon dioxide (CO2)
Methane (CH4)
Nitrous oxide (N2O)

Regarding the fluorinated GHGs, a recent development of the method has made it possible to include the following fluorinated GHGs : hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).

While data on emissions of these gases is reliable for recent years, it remains uncertain for older datas. They are therefore included here to meet European requirements, but are excluded from the figures shown in the Lyon 2030 climate contract.

The modelling of energy emissions is based on:

the final energy consumption balance ;
primary fuel consumption by heating networks and household waste incineration plants (UIOM) connected as a substitute for heat/cold deliveries.

Energy consumption is associated with appropriate emission factors depending on the fuel, the type of boiler, any pollution control systems on industrial sites, etc. Non-energy emissions are the product of activity data and an appropriate emission factor taken from the national methodological guide drawn up by the Centre Interprofessionnel Technique d'Études de la Pollution Atmosphérique (CITEPA). The current version is based on the national emission factors published in the OMINEA 19.1 database [OMINEA_2023.pdf (citepa.org)] produced by CITEPA, the interprofessional technical centre for the study of atmospheric pollution.

## 1. Residential

The residential sector includes emissions from:

Energy:
Homes
Petrol-powered leisure equipment
Non-energy:
Garden fires and cable burning
Domestic use of solvents and pharmaceutical products

## 2. Tertiary

The residential sector includes emissions:

Energy: this includes:
the eight "Buildings" sectors defined by CEREN, which use heating and other uses (domestic hot water, cooking, specific uses of electricity): Offices, Cafés Hotels Restaurants, Shops, Education/Research, Health, Community housing, Sport, culture and leisure, Transport-related activities (logistics, public transport)
Other electricity-consuming industries: Street lighting, General consumption of residential and tertiary buildings, Cold stores, Large public or private research centres, National defence premises, Telecommunications sector, Water sector, Publishing sector, Data centres, Ski resort ski lifts
Non-energetic: anaesthesia

## 3. Manufacturing industry - Non-energy industry

The manufacturing industry sector, which covers a wide range of activities, includes emissions from:

Energy
Non-energy:
Paint application
Use of solvents
Manufacture and use of chemical products: glues, paints, inks, etc.
Processes in the steel, chemical and non-ferrous metals (aluminium) industries
CO2-producing decarbonation processes: lime, cement, tiles/bricks and glass
Aerosol cans
3

Energy conversion

The energy conversion sector includes emissions from:

Processes in the steel and oil industries

Waste treatment

The waste treatment sector includes emissions:
Energy
Non-energy:

Agriculture

The agriculture sector includes emissions from:
Energy: buildings, greenhouses, agricultural and forestry machinery
Non-energy:
Enteric fermentation
Organic and nitrogen compounds from animal waste
growing with fertiliser
Agricultural waste fires and bush burning
Use of pesticides and limestone

Road transport

Road transport covers all vehicles on public roads (cars, light commercial vehicles, heavy goods vehicles, city buses, coaches and motorised two-wheelers). Traffic volumes (Average Annual Daily Traffic) are estimated for the main road network (motorways, trunk roads and most departmental roads) and broken down according to more than 300 detailed vehicle types from CITEPA's national vehicle fleet.

The road transport sector includes emissions from:
Energy: tailpipe emissions
Non-energy: none

Other transport

a. Rail transport

Rail transport includes:
Train movements on all railway lines
Public rail transport: metro, funicular and tramway. The rail transport sector includes emissions:
Energy: emissions from heat-powered trains
Non-energy: none

b. Air transport

The air transport sector includes emissions:
Energy:
Aircraft emissions
Ramp engines and thermal auxiliaries: the associated emissions are calculated for Lyon St-Exupéry airport, as emissions from other platforms are considered negligible.
Non-energy: none

c. River transport

River transport includes energy emissions:
of freight traffic on the Saône/Rhône route
of passenger and pleasure boat traffic on the Saône/Rhône axis, the Canal Latéral de la Loire and the Canal de Roanne à Digoin.

C. Gaps in the GHG inventory

District heating and cooling network

Despite the meticulous work carried out by ORCAE to provide the most reliable and up-to-date data possible on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, errors and uncertainties may persist. To date, an error has been brought to our attention concerning emissions linked to the district heating and cooling network. For 2019, this data has not been recorded for the residential sector.

We have therefore temporarily replaced this incomplete data with data from the previous year, 2018. They are not included in the overall figures and graphs, but are displayed in orange in the summary table of greenhouse gas emissions. This problem is specific to greenhouse gas emissions data and does not affect energy consumption data.

Waste and wastewater treatment

The inventory of GHG emissions for the Lyon area does not include the quantification of GHG emissions linked to the collection and treatment of waste and wastewater produced by the area. Only direct emissions linked to waste treatment facilities in the Lyon area (e.g. UTVE Gerland) are included.

It is therefore proposed to estimate the emissions linked to Scope 3 of the region's waste. The division of responsibilities for waste collection and management in France makes an exhaustive approach to this aspect difficult:
The Lyon Metropole is responsible for the collection and treatment of household waste for the residents of the Metropolitan Area. It plans the management and reduction of this waste on its territory.
The Region plans and coordinates the management of all waste (household and professional) through regional waste prevention and management plans.
Business waste produced by all sectors of activity is the responsibility of the producer. The collection and treatment of this waste is usually entrusted to private service providers.

This is why we have chosen to estimate an order of magnitude based on national data. In 2017, the national low-carbon strategy estimated emissions linked to waste management in France at 14.6 Mt
CO2eq. By cross-referencing these emissions with INSEE population data, waste-related emissions are estimated at 0.219 tCO2eq/inhabitant. This would correspond to 112,882 tCO2eq for Lyon.

This initial estimate provides an order of magnitude, but remains highly imperfect:

It does not take into account the specific characteristics of a highly urban area with very little industry or agriculture.
It does not take into account the local dynamics at work, which enable the inhabitants of the Lyon Metropolitan Area to produce 387 kg/year/inhabitant¹ of household waste, i.e. almost 200 kg less than the national average of 582 kg/year/inhabitant² of household waste in 2019.
Waste treatment facilities are located in the city and emit CO2, both to treat some of the waste from Lyon residents and to treat waste from neighbouring areas. The method used does not allow emissions linked to the specific treatment of waste emitted by the area to be subtracted, which generates a risk of double counting.

## 3. Carbon sequestration

Given that the City of Lyon has very little vegetation, carbon sequestration in the area has been considered negligible and has not been included in either the initial inventory or the modelling.

To give an order of magnitude, on the scale of the metropolis, which comprises 59 municipalities including some rural and forested areas, the annual flow of carbon absorption is estimated at 41 kteqCO2/year compared with GHG emissions of 5733 kteqCO2/year.

# 3. Focus on emissions from the main emitting sectors

# Residential and tertiary buildings

Energy consumption in the residential and tertiary sectors rose by  $2.8\%$  and  $16.3\%$  respectively.

The use of gas as an energy source represents  $59.5\%$  in the residential sector and  $32.8\%$  in the tertiary sector, with an increase of  $4.8\%$  in residential consumption and stagnation in tertiary consumption between 2010 and 2019. Oil-based products are gradually being replaced by gas and the development of district heating, with consumption falling by  $43\%$  in the residential sector and  $27.8\%$  in the tertiary sector. These developments are having a marked impact on greenhouse gas emissions.

# Part 2 - Climate neutrality scenarios and impact pathways (Module B-1)

The City of Lyon wanted to analyse the potential changes in GHG emissions in its area according to different scenarios. The objectives are both to identify what can be achieved by the actions currently planned and the additional efforts that would be required to achieve carbon neutrality.

The City of Lyon has carried out this work using the economic model proposed by NetZeroCities and the following methodology:

) The initial state of the model was adjusted on the basis of our knowledge of the area in terms of buildings, transport and energy. The adjustment was made in such a way as to ensure that the data in the model's initial state differed as little as possible from the emissions actually measured by the ORCAE (data presented above).

) The assumptions for 2030 were then worked on:

a) By first identifying all the objectives set by the various public policies applicable to the Lyon area - See "Assessment of current climate policies and strategies"

b) Then by identifying the areas in which the City of Lyon, either through its competences or through the Agora and cooperation with Lyon Metropole, has the means to take action to further reduce GHG emissions - "climate priority" scenario

c) Then by identifying the additional actions needed to achieve as much as possible of the 80% reduction in emissions - "climate neutrality" scenario
You can consult the full methodology of the model here: https://netzerocities.app/group-capabilitybuildingprogrammebuildingastrongeconomiccase

The assumptions and results of the 2 studied scenarios are detailed below with the means to achieve these objectives. In addition, the model proposes a "business as usual" reference scenario

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  All | French laws and regulations
Lyon Metropole's Climate Plan 2019 2025 | All hypothesis of business as planned scenario | All hypothesis of business as planned scenario and "climate priority" scenario
+ a significant increase in the proportion of renewable electricity produced locally, to help reduce the proportion of fossil fuels in the electricity produced in France.  |
|  Buildings | Energy master plan for the Lyon Metropolitan Area | Heating
+ Decarbonising district heating on a massive scale by purchasing biogas rather than fossil fuel gas.
+ increase in the proportion of heat pump heating replacing fossil fuels

Points to watch: District heating is a metropolitan responsibility. Achieving these objectives is therefore highly dependent on action by the metropolitan authority. | Construction & renovation
+ Very significant acceleration in the renovation of buildings in the region and better quality of renovations carried out, with more highly efficient renovations associated with an acceleration in the renewal of electrical equipment for more efficient appliances, but also with the continuation of energy-saving measures taken from 2022 in both the public and private sectors.
+ Increased compliance with new-build standards through greater awareness among project developers and construction companies and better monitoring of compliance with national regulations.

Heating
+ Increase the number of homes covered by district heating
+ a further increase in the use of heat pumps to replace fossil fuels, accelerated in particular by summer heat waves
Slight increase in the proportion of purchases of biogas as a replacement for fossil fuels by private companies motivated by reducing their carbon footprint

Points to watch: District heating is a metropolitan responsibility. Achieving these objectives is therefore highly dependent on action by the metropolitan authority.  |
|  Transport | National low-carbon strategy roadmaps and projections
Lyon Metropolitan Area Urban Transport Plan
Low-emission zone in the Lyon area | + Reducing the need to travel, in particular through the Ville du ¼ d'heure initiatives, by adapting parking policy. | + Further reduction in travel requirements
+ Greater modal shift from cars and motorised two-wheelers, in particular through parking policy, awareness-raising and the acceleration of traffic calming projects.
+ Accelerating the acquisition of electric vehicles thanks to Lyon's low-emission zone, combined with support for changes in use and the accelerated deployment of on-street electric charging points. The development of car-sharing by the City of Lyon is also helping to encourage people to switch from private combustion-powered cars to shared electric vehicles.

Points to watch: In order to achieve the objectives, greater aid will be needed and progressively greater monitoring of compliance with the EPZ, combined with fines. These actions cannot be carried out by the City alone, but must involve the Metropole, which is implementing the EPZ, and the French government, which is providing aid for the purchase of electric vehicles.  |

There is one major, transversal point of vigilance to be noted in these scenarios: a major shift from fossil fuels to electric power, whether in buildings or transport, presents challenges and risks. These shifts will require electricity networks and power generation to be adapted. They will also lead to a very high level of dependence on electrical energy, and more particularly on nuclear energy, which is subject to cooling problems during heat waves and remains dependent on international supplies. This also raises broader questions about the resilience of the area.

This is why, in addition to the electrification of fossil fuel uses, both the Agora and the City of Lyon more broadly support the commitments and actions in favour of sober uses set out in the Lyon 2030 climate contract and the Climate, Air and Energy Plan. The structure of the model has only allowed this type of action to be valued to a very limited extent.

¹ Residual emissions consist of those emissions which can't be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emission may amount to a maximum of 20 % as stated by the Mission Info Kit.

² Emissions reduction target percentage for "Other" sector is assumed to be the same as for the other 4 main sectors unless updated by city. Activities and commitments to reduce these emissions are documented in the Climate Neutrality Action Plan.

E. Scenarios: limits and prospects

The City of Lyon has identified 2 action scenarios. The first "climate priority" scenario enables the city to achieve a 58% reduction in GHG emissions in its territory between 2019 and 2030. This scenario focuses its actions mainly on the levers available to the city, but depends on the actions of the Lyon Metropole, particularly on its energy purchasing policy for the heating network. It also depends heavily on the commitment of everyone in the region to renovating buildings and changing the way people travel.

The second "climate neutrality" scenario enables the city to achieve a 74% reduction in GHG emissions in its area between 2019 and 2030. It involves not only the city itself, but also all the other players in the region and beyond:

residents and businesses to get involved in renovating buildings and changing mobility and consumption patterns. More broadly, the industry needs to be in a position to keep up with the pace of renovation and change in mobility.
the Metropolis, to accelerate the development of urban heating networks and the mass connection of buildings to these networks, and to promote sustainable mobility;
The government, to continue and step up support and assistance for the renovation of residential and tertiary buildings and the move towards low-carbon mobility. More broadly, to initiate a major change in laws and regulations at all levels in order to give full priority to the climate;
Europe to go further, not only in terms of financial support, but also in terms of a real shift towards stricter climate regulations in all sectors and a drastic limitation on the use of fossil fuels.
To achieve this, the climate must become the number one priority for everyone involved.

The Agora's commitments in these sectors will give a boost to some of the region's key and exemplary stakeholders:

SOBRIETY IN BUILDINGS
1. Raising awareness, training and educating people about energy efficiency in buildings
2. Leading a dialogue between stakeholders to encourage the emergence of low-energy projects in buildings
3. Exemplary sobriety of the built heritage of Agora members

MOBILITY AND TRANSPORT
4. Systematically implement ambitious, jointly-constructed Employer Mobility Plans
5. Organising and encouraging public transport to promote greater sobriety

URBAN LOGISTICS
6. Committing to sustainable logistics cooperation with the Metropole and the City of Paris
7. Optimising logistics flows within structures

In this modelling exercise, the City of Lyon decided not to go any further than the 73% reduction in GHG emissions. Indeed, given the available levers included in the model, it seemed unrealistic to push the cursors any further, given the constraints and the current rhythm in indicator evolution.

On the other hand, through the Agora, the municipality and its region are making a commitment that goes well beyond the transport and buildings parameters taken into account in the model. Their actions will help to reduce the area's GHG emissions in other sectors and through less direct levers. The commitments undertaken by the Agora and set out in the Lyon 2030 climate contract are as follows:

SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT
8. Audit, list and share the practices of Agora members on water / awareness / training

DIGITAL RESPONSIBILITY
9. Establishment of a best practice framework for Agora members to commit together to a common framework for responsible digital content.

ENHANCING THE VALUE OF ESSENTIAL AND NEGLECTED PROFESSIONS
10. Enable all professions (including those that have been discredited) to play a part in the transition and promote them.

FOR COMMUNICATION IN FAVOUR OF SOBRIETY
11. Inform, raise awareness, train and/or educate people to develop a critical culture of advertising mechanisms and to adopt sober and responsible lifestyles.
12. Implement sober and responsible internal/external communication practices

CONSUMPTION AND WASTE

3
Building a Zero Waste model by 2030
Promote responsible purchasing and consumption

COOPERATION AND POOLING
15. Sharing and working together

SKETCHING OUT THE FUTURE
16. Involving the Agora in writing a story about the desirable city by 2030 - around sobriety

As far as the City of Lyon is concerned, these other levers are detailed in the Climate, Air and Energy Plan for the City of Lyon (see Climate, Air and Energy Plan for the City of Lyon and the Communal Centre for Social Action 2023-2030). These include the city's responsible purchasing policy, which encourages virtuous businesses and the structuring of innovative sectors; the cultural cooperation charter and the culture and climate promotions, which commit the region's cultural players to the ecological transition; the environmental certification of the city's events and the work undertaken with the stakeholders of these events; and all the initiatives aimed at raising awareness of the climate and the ecological transition among all the people of Lyon.

It is important to remember that the Lyon 2030 approach, supported by the City of Lyon, is firmly rooted in a dynamic of continuous improvement of actions and commitments in order to go further and faster in the climate action of both the municipality and the region. It is this iterative approach that will enable us to work together towards the goal of carbon neutrality.

Through this approach, the City aims to initiate transitions that go beyond the climate issue by integrating complementary and essential principles:

Inclusivity and social justice, for a climate transition for all the people of Lyon;
Democracy and collective construction, for a climate transition that mobilises all energies and intelligence in the construction of a common project;
Taking account of the living world through environmental health and biodiversity, for a transition whose scope must go beyond the human and take into account the health of our entire environment.

These three key principles form the basis of the municipality's action in favour of the climate. Taking these issues into account also means ensuring that the region is more resilient to climate disruption.

Finally, the priority today is to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the knowledge that certain residual emissions cannot be completely neutralised. Quantifying these irreducible emissions will enable us to start thinking about solutions in the medium term. The City wishes to take the time to work on this aspect in depth so as to put in place the most integrated compensation solutions possible.

# Assessment of current climate policies and strategies (Module A-2)

Courtesy translation

## Part1- List of relevant policies, strategies and regulations (A-2.1)

In France, public policies on the climate and ecological transition are the result of the interlocking of regulatory and strategic planning documents at various scales, all of which are highly interrelated:

at national level, through major structuring laws, national objectives and commitments, and national planning documents. The national level is likely to cover all sectors.

The national level also responds to supra-national commitments: the commitments made at the various COPs and in particular the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, the objectives set by the European Union through the European Green Deal, etc.

The State also produces prescriptive territorial documents such as risk prevention plans and atmospheric protection plans.

At regional level, the Regional Plan for Sustainable Development and Territorial Equality provides a vision of the priorities to be given to spatial planning on a number of climate-related issues: the location of various infrastructures of regional interest, housing, economical management of space, intermodality and development of transport at a regional scale, energy management and development, the fight against climate change, air pollution, the protection and restoration of biodiversity, waste prevention and management.

This document is drawn up jointly by the State and local authorities.

It forms the basis for local planning documents.

At the level of the Lyon conurbation, which brings together several inter-municipalities, the Territorial Coherence Plan defines the major planning and development guidelines for the Lyon conurbation over the next 20 years. It incorporates national and regional public policies on housing, the economy, transport and the environment.

This document forms the basis for local planning documents.

At the level of Lyon Metropole, the territorial planning documents are thematic with an operational dimension, as these plans directly concern the Metropole's competences: Local Intercommunal Town Planning and Housing Plan, Lyon Metropole's Climate Plan 2019 2025, Energy Master Plan, Urban Transport Plan, Local Programme for the Prevention of Household and Similar Waste, Lyon Territorial Food Plan, etc.
At national and metropolitan level, public policies are set out in a series of strategic documents. At municipal level, the City of Lyon uses these documents to incorporate public policies into the work of its departments and the exercise of its responsibilities. As well as simply transposing them locally, the City of Lyon is adjusting the objectives to meet its commitment to carbon neutrality by 2030.

Public policies are detailed at the various scales below.

|  All | Territorial Coherence Plan for the Lyon conurbation - SEPAL
**Approved in 2010 - Amended in 2017**
**Under review** | The Territorial Coherence Plan sets the fundamental long-term guidelines (20 years) for the organisation of the Lyon conurbation in all its components, harmonising public policy objectives in terms of housing, economic development, transport and the environment. It is based on a number of fundamental choices: - the choice of economic development, - the choice of residential development, - the choice to make the environment a factor in development, - the choice of solidarity. | Objectives: The Territorial Coherence Plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, cut energy consumption by 20% and increase the share of renewable energy to 20% by 2020 compared with 1990. A 30% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.

**Need for action:** The objectives are no longer in line with the national framework, which is why a review of the Territorial Coherence Plan has been underway since 2022.  |

**Approved in 2022** | In agglomerations where limit values or target values for the concentration of atmospheric pollutants are exceeded or are likely to be exceeded, the State must draw up air quality plans to achieve these values. This is the role of the Atmosphere Protection Plan.
Measures covering industry & construction, residential & tertiary, agriculture, mobility and urban planning | Air quality objectives, but with actions that will contribute to a non-objective reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (reduction in industrial emissions, replacement of heating systems, renovation of buildings, agricultural practices, transformation of mobility, etc.).  |
|  All | Lyon Metropole’s Climate Plan 2019-2025 - Lyon Metropole
**Approved in 2019**
**Under review** | Lyon Metropole’s Climate Plan is a strategic and operational planning approach that applies to all sectors of activity.
Main areas of action :
all ordinary heroes
an economy integrating the challenges of climate change
sustainable and inclusive development
a low-carbon mobility system
our region and its resources | Objectives:
a 43% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 2000,
a 30% reduction in energy consumption by 2030 compared with 2000,
doubling the share of renewable energies in the region's energy consumption by 2030.

**The need to act:** The Metropole has undertaken to update its Climate Plan in order to move the region towards carbon neutrality by 2050. Lyon Metropole is a key partner in the carbon neutrality of Lyon's territory through its expertise in mobility, waste and the circular economy, town planning and housing, etc.  |
|  Buildings | Energy Master Plan - Lyon Metropolitan Area
**Approved in 2019**
**Under review** | To define its energy transition strategy for 2030, Lyon Metropole has adopted an Energy Master Plan. This tool provides an overview of energy production and consumption across the region, and enables us to plan for future developments. The aim is also to organise the networks and production facilities to achieve a more sustainable energy system. | Objectives:
-20% less energy consumption by 2030 than in 2013
17% of renewable and recovered energy as a proportion of metropolitan consumption by 2030, i.e. a growth rate of 100%.
To achieve: -43% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 2000

**The need to act:** The Metropole has undertaken to update its Climate Plan, and therefore it's Energy Master Plan, in order to move the region towards carbon neutrality by 2050.  |

|  All | Intercommunal Local Urban Plan integrating the local housing programme - Lyon Metropole | A land management tool, the intercommunal Local Urban Plan organises the living environment within Greater Lyon. It maps out the city of the future by reconciling local and communal interests with those of the Lyon conurbation.
The gradual changes will make it possible to link urban development with mobility possibilities and, in order to limit the need to travel, to offer more and more green space. | The need for action: The Intercommunal Local Urban Plan is a powerful tool for new construction, but cannot be used to transform existing buildings, which are in the majority in Lyon.  |
|  Waste | Local Programme for the Prevention of Household and Similar Waste 2019-2024 & Waste Master Plan 2030 - Lyon Metropole | This action programme sets out the objectives for reducing waste quantities and the measures put in place to achieve them. It is structured around 7 key areas:
Encouraging public bodies to set an example
Raising the profile of waste prevention in the region
Experiment with new ways of charging for public services
Combating food waste
Encouraging local management of bio-waste and reducing the production of plant residues
Giving a second life to products destined for the scrap heap
Promoting eco-consumption | Objectives: The reduction targets show a reduction in residual waste of -1.50% per year on average from 2019 to 2024.
This objective is complemented by the waste master plan:
Reduce by 25% the annual production of household and similar waste per inhabitant, i.e. approximately -90kg/inhabitant
Increase material and organic recovery, and reach 60% of waste recovered
Reduce by 50% the amount of household and similar waste collected by the metropolis that is incinerated

|  Transport | Urban transport plan 2017-2030 for the Lyon conurbation - Sytral
**Approved in 2017**
**Currently being revised as a Mobility Plan** | An urban travel plan is a planning document that determines, within an urban transport perimeter, the organisation of the transport of people and goods, traffic and parking.
The Urban transport plan has chosen to structure its action plan around a strategy based on 8 axes:
seamless mobility ;
• a public space that welcomes and facilitates active modes of transport
• efficient and attractive public transport
• regulated and rational car mobility; encouraging and supporting changes in behaviour
• guarantee access to mobility for all and in the most vulnerable areas
• integrated freight transport
• appropriate governance and funding. | **Objectives:**
• To achieve the following targets for journeys made within the Urban transport plan area of application by 2030: 35% by car and motorised two-wheelers; 35% on foot (including walking aids); 22% on public transport (urban and non-urban); 8% by bicycle.
• Reduce by at least 5% by 2030 the number of kilometres travelled by private cars and road haulage compared with 2015 in the area covered by the Urban transport plan.
• Reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road transport in the Urban transport plan area by more than 35% in 2030 compared with 2005.

**Need for action:** The GHG emission reduction target set by the Urban transport plan is insufficient to achieve carbon neutrality. The current review will enable us to raise the level of ambition of the region's mobility strategy.  |

In a context of accelerating climate action at all levels, the targets currently set by public policy fall considerably short of the goal of carbon neutrality for both 2030 and 2050. This is why many of these policies are being reviewed to make them more ambitious. New strategic areas are also emerging, with the Lyon Metropole in particular drawing up a logistics plan for goods and services.

In addition, for over 15 years, the municipality has committed to international agreements to affirm its commitment to the climate. As a result, it now belongs to a network of Major European and global cities that are committed to the ecological transition.

Eurocities - since 2008: Networking to promote the role of a network of partners under the banner of ecological transition.
Covenant of Mayors for Climate Change - since 2008: A joint commitment by several of the world's major cities to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Climate Air Energy Label for the Territoire Engagé pour la Transition Écologique approach - since 2013: French version of the European Energy Award label. Methodology designed to promote and assess the quality of local climate and energy policies.
Green Cities Accord - since 2019 : Agreement signed by mayors to guide them in deepening their ecological commitment. Helps them implement measures to make their cities greener, cleaner and healthier.

## Part 2 - Evaluation of policies and their impact on GHG emissions

To measure the effects of these public policies, an initial study was carried out using the economic model proposed by NetZeroCities. This made it possible to estimate an effect of public policies and current trends that would enable greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by around 40% between
and 2030 if all the objectives of these policies were effectively achieved. This reduction is clearly insufficient to achieve the objective of carbon neutrality to which the City of Lyon has committed for its territory.

Achieving this objective would require a stronger commitment and, above all, an acceleration in the implementation of actions at all levels, particularly with regard to buildings and transport, which are major sources of emissions in the area.

This is why the City of Lyon is taking action and mobilising its region to accelerate and strengthen climate action at its own level. Nevertheless, a significant amount of work will be needed to change public policies and regulations at different scales in order to remove obstacles and work together to make Lyon a pioneer in climate neutrality.
