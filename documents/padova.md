# 1 Summary

## Summary

Following its selection as one of the Net Zero Cities Mission's 100 cities, the Municipality of Padova has embarked on a journey to revise its own decarbonization plan, the SECAP, with the goal of switching from its 2030 target of halving greenhouse gas emissions to climate neutrality. This new goal is a real step change, allowing the local authority to draw up a new vision for the city with an increasing focus on environmental and social sustainability. Although Padova started on its path to reducing the city's carbon footprint a long time ago (the first plan dates back to the late '90s), reaching climate neutrality entails a profound change, in terms of both new projects and synergies between various local stakeholders, and in letting go of entrenched habits and behaviours that, while firmly rooted in our everyday lives, are now clearly incompatible with a climate-neutral city.

Another key theme of Padova's CCC concerns residential, commercial and institutional buildings and industry, which account for 76% of final energy usage in the city. Again, various measures are planned to drastically reduce GHG emissions: from replacing boilers and generators with electric heat pumps — where possible powered by renewable energy — to the installation of rooftop PV solar panels and the implementation of Renewable (and socially responsible) Energy Communities, from the energy upgrading of buildings through to the creation of one or more district heating networks. To achieve the climate neutrality goal, Padova Municipality, based on experience gained through its Energy Help Desk (Sportello Energia), aims to build a new One-Stop Shop: a public-private entity designed to bring together energy upgrade initiatives for residential, commercial, institutional and industrial buildings and to present private business operators (ESCOs) with investment package proposals, creating advantageous economies of scale and promoting Energy Efficiency Contracts.

A case in point is the city transport sector, which accounts for 24% of Padova's final energy usage, making it a key part of the decarbonization strategy. It is no coincidence, then, that 6 out of Padova's 14 Climate City Contract strategic actions concern transport. Several mutually integrated measures will be implemented to bring down mobility-related emissions, designed to change the way people move around the city: the SMART project (city-wide tram network system); the phasing out of local public transport buses running on diesel, replacing them with new electric vehicles powered by renewable energy; the promotion of cycling with the full implementation of Padova's "Bicipolitana" cycling network and city-wide installation of bike racks and bike boxes; the implementation of mobility management policies through local businesses and schools with their own mobility managers and the promotion of Mobility as a Service (MaaS); the creation of a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and introduction of an Ultra LEZ; and the electrification of the private vehicle fleet.

There will be additional strategic Climate City Contract actions around the promotion of green power purchasing by various actors (industries, parishes, large building owners). This action has the potential to increase the renewable energy penetration level across the municipality in a way that is complementary to local energy production. On the waste front, the CCC provides for a progressive improvement in source-separated waste collection in the city, significantly reducing the percentage of non-separated waste and the pro-capita production of dry waste. The Municipality is also extending the city's green spaces and, in recent years, has adopted a policy of boosting the tree population with initiatives such as the 10,000 trees for Padova project. Fully achieving the Plan's goals will depend on the successful recovery of some of the city's land with the

implementation of depaving initiatives and others to increasing the permeability of urban surfaces.

Achieving climate neutrality also entails executing targeted communication campaigns that need to be developed to suit the socioeconomic, demographic and cultural makeup of the various segments of the population living in the city, in order to pull the right levers and use the language and communication tools best suited to each geographical and residential context. Communication campaigns will also be fine-tuned to support and boost the results achieved through strategic actions and to inform citizens and businesses about existing opportunities and the best behaviours for reducing their carbon footprint.

Overall, the Climate City Contract's strategic actions — which include the contribution of all public and private entities and individuals who have signed the Climate Agreements for whatever reason and have expressed their will and commitment to put into effect climate neutrality actions — will result in a 855,501 tonne reduction in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  that, together with the goals of existing strategies (those provided for and included in the SECAP, approved by the City Council in 2021) — amounting to 168,017 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  — will result in the municipal area reducing the emissions measured in 2021 (the base year) by approximately  $80\%$ . A clog of residual emissions will be difficult to abate by 2030 ("hard to abate" emissions) due to technological, infrastructural, economic and behavioral constraints. Some of these emissions can be offset by expanding the city's green areas and planting new trees. In recent years, the City of Padova has adopted a policy of expanding tree cover, for example through the 10,000 Trees for Padova project, the full implementation of which will be conditional on the implementation of de-paving of some of the city's soils.

Producing a plan like the CCC requires a huge collective effort across the city, in which everyone is engaged and plays an active role. Hence, Padova Municipality started by coordinating a participatory process in which over 30 local stakeholders discussed and identified the main barriers and opportunities to achieving climate neutrality, eventuating in the signing of actual Climate Agreements in which each signatory has taken responsibility for implementing specific actions that will contribute to the city's decarbonization.

A range of actions have been put in place: mitigation and adaptation, education and training, communication, research and development and financial support actions.

To date, 36 Climate Agreements have been signed, with a wide range of different entities: universities, research centres and competence centres, multi-utilities and Council subsidiaries, through to private companies and startups, trade associations, third sector organizations, foundations and banks. Signing up to the CCC will remain voluntary and open to all, based on a permanent Living Lab approach.

The path to climate neutrality that Padova has embarked on demands a strong innovative drive. In this sense, Padova boasts a booming innovation ecosystem, which is growing around the Municipality — the heart of a global community — the University — the epitome of culture and international vivacity — and the Chamber of Commerce — the engine driving the city's economic development. This ecosystem is fuelled by the Innovation Council. In 2023, Padova came second in the "Rising Innovative City" category of the European Capital of Innovation Awards.

Padova's change is already under way, having started several years ago now, though all actions are expected to be ramped up between now and 2030. This is a significant effort by the urban ecosystem that — through a combination of construction sites, events, new projects and new habits — will see the City of Padova reshaped both socially and ecologically and, above all, move full steam ahead towards climate neutrality.

# 5 Introduction

# Table I.1: Introduction

Padova Municipality has been well aware of the key role of Climate Action since 1999, when the City Energy Plan (P.EN.CO) was approved. The energy and climate planning timeline has advanced over the years since:

in 2004, with the Energy Efficiency Plan
in 2009, with the Operational Energy Plan
in 2011, with the SEAP (Sustainable Energy Action Plan), which set 2020 targets
in 2016, with guidelines for drawing up the Adaptation Plan
in 2021, with the SECAP (Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan) with new 2030 targets.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure I.1: Padova City energy and climate planning timeline

Padova Municipality's vision is currently incorporated into the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan $^{1}$ , which includes the main purposes and long-term goals in terms of sustainability and environmental protection. The SECAP was approved by Council on 14 June 2021 with the following goals: to accelerate the decarbonization process, increase the ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change, increase green power and optimize energy efficiency across all sectors.

In early 2022, the Mayor decided to sign up to the EU Climate Neutral and Smart City Mission, committing the City to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and bringing the SECAP's planned objectives forward by 20 years. Key to the success of this undertaking is strong cooperation between stakeholders both within and outside government, according to a horizontal and vertical governance model, and with extensive engagement across the municipality.

Padova Municipality has taken on the mantle of steering and monitoring the development of the Climate City Contract, working in synergy with a number of different entities, institutional and otherwise, at every level. The model adopted by Padova has two levels:

a vertical level, which features different relations with higher-level bodies (Province of Padova, energy distributors, Ministries, national agencies, network with the other eight Italian Mission Cities);

a horizontal level defining governance at a local level.

The political direction of the Mission is determined by the Mayor and the Councillor for the Environment, who identify the general policies for achieving the 2030 climate neutrality target. The Environment and Land Department — supported by Senior Management and Financial Resources, and working in synergy with other relevant Departments — has the task of coordinating the planning, execution and monitoring of the Climate City Contract.

An interdepartmental Task Force was established in 2022 and will be assisted by a Steering Group with tasks of a more operational nature: from exploring and conceiving actions, projects and programmes to the organization of citizen communication and information activities and setting up meetings and sessions for the exchange of information and collaboration with local actors.

Embracing the horizontal cooperation concept, the Municipality has sought the University of Padova's contribution for research and help with certain topics, with the signing of a memorandum of understanding during the course of 2023: the University is an important entity for the municipal area for the promotion of innovation and research and for underpinning decisions made towards achieving climatic neutrality.

On the multistakeholder collaboration front, the Municipality has established a strong and highly active and cooperation-oriented network of local public and private sector actors. This synergistic relationship — which has come together in a Living Lab, created as part of the European 2ISECAP project², funded by the H2020 programme — is spawning numerous opportunities, not least the Manifesto for the formation of RECs.

When it comes to emissions, Padova Municipality has identified 2021 as the base year for calculating the GHG emissions reduction and 2030 climate neutrality targets. 2021 was the last year monitored as part of the SECAP's implementation. 2021's emissions have already been reduced by 31.8% when compared to the SECAP base year (2005), indicating a positive trend in line with the identified targets. A summary of the city's emissions picture is given in module A-1. Following its selection as one of the EU's 100 Net Zero Cities, the city has embarked on a path to further scale up and extend the action portfolio, given that the actions provided for by the SECAP are no longer sufficient, with their "less ambitious" goal of halving GHG emissions by 2030. A full report on measures included in the CCC is presented in module B-2.

Taking the current emissions picture as its starting point, strategic pillars were defined for the "Padova 2030", Carbon-Neutral &amp; Smart City plan:

sustainability, with a view to achieving climate neutrality goals,
digitalization, turning Padova into a European Smart City,
the "Grande Padova" scheme, designed to attract talent to provide innovative solutions that improve top-quality public services and aim to promote citizens' general health and wellbeing.

Achieving these goals necessarily entails an integrated action across multiple sectors in which all areas responsible for GHG emissions in the local context are included and managed in a coordinated manner. In this sense, Padova Municipality can lay claim to the integration of numerous City plans, approved in recent years, as listed below:

Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan- SUMP, 2020³
Green Spaces Plan, 2022⁴

Green Purchasing Plan, currently being updated.

The integration of the above Plans, done through the SECAP and Climate City Contract, is essential for a transition that takes a holistic approach, that is familiar with and takes into consideration the dynamics and needs in the various sectors involved in the municipality's decarbonization process, and that works so that each sector makes a synergistic contribution to achieving climate neutrality.

# 6 Part A – Current state of climate action

## 6.1. Module A-1 Greenhouse gas emissions baseline inventory

Driven by its firm belief in the need to play an active role in tackling climate change, Padova Municipality joined the European Covenant of Mayors initiative back in 2010 (following City Council resolution no. 41 dated 10/05/2010).

The Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) was approved in 2011, taking 2005 emissions as its baseline and identifying a 2020 target of reducing them by 20%. This goal, in line with the EU policies of the Energy &amp; Climate 20/20/20 package, was already achieved in 2017, an annuality monitored when the SECAP, successor to the SEAP, was drafted. With the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), approved by the City Council in June 2021 (resolution no. 64 dated 14/06/2021), the municipality's GHG emissions reduction target was doubled, moving the target year to 2030, in line with the targets set by the new Covenant of Mayors and by EU and national strategies.

The results obtained with the SEAP have shown how the decarbonization trend is associated with policies and actions that originate from different institutional levels, but whose effects materialize at the municipal level. The policies to incentivize energy upgrades stimulated by the Ecobonus are an example of how national policies have had an important effect on reducing energy consumption in the Padova area. This awareness has pushed the Administration toward more ambitious goals and toward actions to be promoted locally that can complement and enhance the effect of regional and national policies.

The emissions inventory has been updated at regular intervals, through subsequent monitoring, up to the latest version referring to the year 2021, approved by the City Council with act. no. 326/2023 dated 27/06/2023.

The Climate City Contract (CCC) baseline inventory is therefore an additional step forwards in the process of quantifying local emissions and is built on the findings of the latest update of the SECAP emissions inventory (base year 2021). Nonetheless, the latter inventory has been calculated using the methodology defined at a European level by the Covenant of Mayors initiative, which differs slightly from the one used as part of the Mission 100 Carbon Neutral and Smart Cities, meaning some amendments and additions are needed. Consequently, the Climate City Contract baseline inventory has been brought into line with the calculation method indicated in the documents made available by the Net Zero Cities consortium.

Below is a list of the main differences between the EoI emissions inventory and the Climate City Contract baseline for the same year:

Emission factors: different emission factors from those used in the SECAP have been applied to calculate emissions. Consequently, while in the SECAP the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory NIR emission factors have been used to calculate the CCC baseline, emission factors from the IPPC GHG approach in terms of tCO₂eq have been applied here. These calculations of a technical nature refer to the methodological system developed in 2006 by the IPCC in order to create common methodologies for estimating GHG emissions. This means that, while both are based on the same final energy use values, the resulting total emissions differ.

Additional emission source sectors: this addition is necessary as it is explicitly required as part of the 100 Carbon Neutral Cities Mission. The additional source sectors are as follows:

Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU), which takes into account emissions that are directly released into the atmosphere and not connected to final energy usage, relating to the agricultural sector (e.g. manure management, use of fertilizers, muck spreading, etc.) and changes to intended land use. In this specific case, the EoI emissions inventory did not take into account emissions associated with livestock rearing and soil fertilizing (nitrogenous waste management, crops grown with or without fertilizers, enteric fermentation and organic waste management) and neither $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ absorption by trees in the city's public and private spaces. Assessments conducted as part of Padova Municipality's Green Spaces Plan (approved in 2022) have quantified the benefits to the ecosystem offered by the tree population, which includes the ability to capture and store carbon. The total amount of carbon sequestered annually is approximately 5,070 tonnes for the whole municipal area, equivalent to 18,625 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ removed from the atmosphere. Overall, the positive contribution linked to this absorption can completely cancel out the emissions associated with crop and livestock agriculture, producing an additional benefit to offset emissions from other sectors.

Industrial Production and Product Use (IPPU) sector, which computes emissions from industrial production processes, i.e., emissions associated with the production of a given product$^{7}$.

Emissions associated with methane leaks from the gas distribution network in the City of Padova (CH4).

Emissions associated with wastewater treatment (CH4, N2O).

Below are the emissions divided up according to the model provided by the Net Zero Cities consortium, with the lines featuring the different sectors and the columns the relevant energy carrier, sorted into the three Scopes: where Scope 1 refers to GHG emissions generated by combustion processes within the geographical boundary of the system being investigated (in this case, inside the city boundary); Scope 2 refers to emissions resulting from the use of grid-supplied energy (e.g. electricity and district heating), where the energy generation process takes place outside the system's geographical boundary (e.g. thermal power station generating electricity); Scope 3 refers to emissions generated outside the city boundary but related to processes that occur within the municipality (e.g. production of waste/wastewater produced inside the municipality that are then sent to waste-to-energy/treatment facilities located in other municipal areas).

$^{7}$ This sector is not counted because all production activities located in Padova that have emissions related to IPPUs are included in the Emission Trading Scheme and are therefore unbundled from the municipal emissions budget, as required by the Covenant of Mayors guidelines

emissions breakdown by sector  $\left[\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\mathrm{eq} / \mathrm{year}\right]$
Figure A.1: 2021 emissions breakdown by source sector  $\left[\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}\right]$

The chart shows how most of Padova City's emissions are related to the "Buildings" sector, which accounts for  $73\%$ . They mainly include emissions due to final energy use related to the use of public and private building stock (including industrial buildings) and relevant equipment found throughout Padova's municipal area (e.g. public street lighting). These emissions include losses associated with the methane gas distribution network serving civil and industrial buildings. The city's building stock (which totals approximately 31,000 buildings and 100,000 residential dwellings, plus 1,000 buildings for industrial use and another 2,100 buildings used by the tertiary sector) is particularly old and, even though energy upgrading has been carried out as a result of tax break policies in recent years (e.g. the "Superbonus 110" scheme), much of the housing stock still needs work to improve energy performance and thermal comfort.

% of emissions are instead attributable to vehicular traffic. In 2021, 90% of the total annual kilometres were still being driven in cars or other motor vehicles.

Lastly,  $4\%$  of the city's GHG emissions is linked to the "Waste" sector, which includes emissions that are not attributable to energy usage, instead referring to  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  and  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  produced as a result of wastewater treatment and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  from incineration.

It should be noted that the chart in Figure A.1 has been compiled on the basis that the contribution of the AFOLU sector is zero.

The chart in Figure A.2 gives a more detailed breakdown of the data illustrated in Figure A.1. More specifically, the "Buildings" sector is split into the SECAP emission subsectors: residential, tertiary, industry and agriculture, public lighting, waste, while the "Transport" sector is divided into the subsectors public transportation and private transportation. In this analysis, the tertiary sector also includes municipal buildings, and the industry sector also includes agriculture. In addition, a further subsector has been added: "Buildings: other", which refers to emissions related to methane distribution (rather than to energy usage). A picture emerges in which the "Industry and agriculture" subsector comes top for emissions contribution, as the final energy use related to this sector accounts for  $27\%$  of total emissions. Having a nationally and internationally significant (for Europe) industrial hub (Padova's so-called "ZIP" industrial area) — which is very logistics heavy — makes introducing energy efficiency improvement measures and the production of renewable energy in this area of the city a key priority.

Coming in just below is the "private and commercial transport" subsector, accounting for  $23\%$  of total emissions, followed by the "tertiary (including municipal)" subsector with  $22\%$  of total emissions. The residential subsector comes in fourth place, with  $20\%$  of emissions.

It should be noted that the chart in Figure A.2 has been compiled on the basis that the contribution of the AFOLU sector is zero.

The histogram in Figure A.3 shows how most emissions can be attributed to Scope 1, made up of over half of the emissions of the Buildings sector and all emissions generated by the Transport and Waste sectors. At the time of the analysis, there were no emissions to be attributed to Scope 3. Further in-depth investigations will be carried out over the coming years to give a more detailed picture of the emissions contribution of certain supply chains, such as food and clothing. It should be noted that the chart in Figure A.3 has been compiled on the basis that the contribution of the AFOLU sector is zero.

carrier/GHG: it reveals that the two main sources are methane gas and electricity consumption. The Pareto line on the chart clearly shows that the two above-mentioned energy carriers are responsible for 75% of total emissions. The progressive electrification of heating systems (currently running on methane gas) will lead to the two energy carriers swapping places in the coming years, with electricity destined to become the most widely used carrier, without counting the efficiency improvement and energy self-generation policies, which should reduce the total percentage of all carriers overall.

Please note that the negative contribution of the AFOLU sector (as a result of the benefit brought by the annual carbon sequestration capacity of the city's trees, which far outweighs the other agriculture-related emissions) — which would bring the emissions total down slightly — has not been factored into the percentages relating to each sector in any of the above charts

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of greenhouse gas baseline emissions

The Padova CCC 2021 baseline has been quantified as amounting to 1,283,174 tCO $_2$ eq.

The general picture shows how most emissions relate to Scope 1 as they are generated by combustion processes (heating systems, vehicles, etc.) that take place directly within the city boundary. Scope 2, on the other hand, covers the rest of the emissions and consists solely in final electricity use.

When it comes to the breakdown by sector, most emissions (approximately 938,957 tCO $_2$ eq) fall into the "BUILDINGS" category. In the "BUILDINGS" sector, most emissions can be attributed to the industry and tertiary subsectors. They are followed, in the "TRANSPORT" sector, by private and commercial transport, which account for approximately 303,530 tCO $_2$ eq, which amounts to roughly 24% of total emissions. The WASTE sector accounts for the remaining emissions, with an overall percentage of slightly higher than 4% of the total. Lastly, the AFOLU sector, based on the quantification of sequestration due to the city's tree population, generates a negative contribution, namely -0.9%, which reduces the total amount of emissions slightly.

|  Table A-1.5: 2021 baseline emissions by subsector  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | tCO2eq | %  |
|  BUILDINGS: tertiary sector (including municipal) | 296,337 | 23.1 %  |
|  BUILDINGS: public lighting | 3,210 | 0.2 %  |
|  BUILDINGS: residential sector | 264,807 | 20.6 %  |
|  BUILDINGS: industry and agriculture | 351,052 | 27.4 %  |
|  BUILDINGS: other | 23,551 | 1.8 %  |
|  BUILDINGS TOTAL | 938,957 | 73.1 %  |
|  TRANSPORT: municipal fleet | 288 | 0.0 %  |
|  TRANSPORT: public transport | 8,709 | 0.7 %  |

|  IPPU | - | 0.0 %  |
|  AFOLU | - 11,534 | - 0.9 %  |
|  TOTAL | 1,283,174 | 100 %  |

Please note that, in the above table, the percentages relating to each sector have been calculated also taking into account the negative contribution of the AFOLU sector: consequently, these percentages differ from those illustrated in the previous pie charts.

Final energy use has been calculated using usage data in MWh from the 2021 emissions inventory compiled as part of the SECAP. However, certain changes have had to be made in putting together the CCC baseline in order to comply with the methodological instructions contained in the "Infokit for Cities" guidelines.

The differences between the Eol baseline and the CCC baseline, as mentioned in the introductory
COMUNE di PADOVA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

remarks, are as follows:

the usage in MWh described in section A1.1 has been calculated by applying the IPCC emission factors in tCO₂eq/MWh suggested by the Covenant of Mayors Office (COMo), in ANNEX 1 - Fuel Emission Factors Database⁸. On this note, it is worth mentioning that the SECAP/Eol methodology instead refers to emission factors relating to the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory NIR;
electricity usage was calculated using the national emission factor as at 2021, namely 0.285 tCO₂eq/MWh (source: CoM GHG Emission Factors for Electricity Consumption, 2024⁹).

Note that the SECAP/Eol methodology referred instead to emission factors related to the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory NIR.

In addition, as mentioned in the introduction, emissions associated with methane leaks from the gas distribution network in the City of Padova (CH4), those associated with wastewater treatment (CH4, N2O), and the contribution of the AFOLU sector (see calculation directions below) were added.

# AFOLU SECTOR – CO₂ absorption contribution by the city's tree population

As part of the Green Spaces Plan¹⁰, approved by the City Council with resolution no. 29/2022 dated 28/03/2022, an assessment was conducted to determine carbon dioxide emissions absorbed by the city's trees in public and private spaces. The characteristics of the tree population were estimated using iTree software based on the green space land register data. The services provided by the tree population (approximately 430,000 trees in the city's public and private spaces), in terms of offsetting greenhouse gases, reveal an annual sequestration of approximately 5,072 tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of approximately 18,625 tonnes of CO₂ removed from the atmosphere.

If we take the emissions contribution of agriculture (effluent, fertilizers, enteric fermentation) — which, in 2021, accounted for 7,091 tonnes of CO₂ — and subtract the emissions absorbed annually by the city's trees (18,625 tonnes of CO₂), the resulting contribution for AFOLU is a "negative" 11,534 tonnes of CO₂.

## 6.2. Module A-2 Description of current policies and strategies

The aim of this section is to help identify the policies and strategies being implemented that are helping achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The assessment of current policies and strategies thus offers a starting point for exploring what might be the issues and areas on which efforts and investments need to be focused at an EU, national and local level.

The assessment will be of a purely descriptive nature, highlighting, for each initiative, the goals and progress of measures being implemented in various areas, such as spatial planning, energy, waste, transport, housing, urban green spaces and nature-based solutions.

## Table A-2.1: Description of policies

This section covers the policies, plans, programmes and regulations that either directly or indirectly impact the climate neutrality goals. Below is an outline of the policies around which the green transition debate has hinged over the last few years. Many of these policies are currently being updated and revised.

### Policies at a European level

European policies on the energy and environmental front are going through a period of profound change: in 2021, the European Commission reviewed Europe's net greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets to hit at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. This, and other goals of a similar nature, are contained in the plans and initiatives presented below.

### Green Deal

The European Green Deal is a package encompassing strategic initiatives that aims to set the European Union on the path to the green transition, the ultimate goal being to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The Commission set out compiling the Deal in December 2019 and the European Council acknowledged it in its December meeting of the same year. The Plan puts the emphasis on cross-cutting measures, to encourage an EU-wide approach in which all strategic areas — namely climate, environment, energy, transport, industry, agriculture and sustainable finance — are tackled synergistically. Defining a strategy at a European level to achieve climate neutrality puts emissions reduction targets and the definition of a single CO2 emissions market in the centre of the debate. As part of the Green Deal package, the Commission has set out Next Generation EU — a funding tool to tackle the new challenges felt across Europe that have emerged following the COVID-19 pandemic — and REPowerEU as the key initiatives intended to support the Plan's goals.

### Next Generation EU

NextGenerationEU is a temporary tool established in 2020 to deal with the socioeconomic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides funding totalling 806.9 billion euros, with the aim of funding the economic recovery of EU Member States. Funding comes in the shape of grants and loans awarded to countries who have applied for funding for recovery and resilience plans covering the 2021-2027 period. The Plan is divided into six Missions, which make up the structural "thematic" areas of intervention.

Digitalization, innovation, competitiveness, culture and tourism
Green revolution and ecological transition
Infrastructure for sustainable mobility
COMUNE di PADOVA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

Education and Research
Inclusion and Cohesion
Health

Many infrastructure interventions envisaged in the CCC and pivotal elements of Padova's climate neutrality strategy (including the tramways) have been financed with NextGeneration EU resources.

## REPowerEU

In response to the difficulties and disruptions in the global energy market as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission, in May 2022, presented the REPowerEU plan, with the goal of reducing the EU's reliance on Russian fossil fuels, fast-forwarding the transition and building a more resilient energy system. The Plan is based on four key pillars:

saving energy,
producing clean energy,
diversifying its energy supply,
smart pooling of investments and reforms.

In terms of producing clean energy, the Union agreed to stricter legislation in March 2023 to boost its renewable energy capabilities, raising the EU's binding target for 2030 to 42.5%, with the ambition of reaching 45%, which would be almost double the percentage of current renewable energy in the EU.

In addition, the need to diversify the energy supply has led the EU to enter into agreements with third-party countries to pipe in gas, to invest in the joint procurement of liquefied natural gas (LNG), to enter into strategic partnerships with Namibia, Egypt and Kazakhstan to ensure a reliable and sustainable supply of renewable hydrogen, and to sign agreements with Egypt and Israel for the export of natural gas to the continent. The Plan has entailed substantial investments and reforms: the total amount comes in at almost 300 billion euros, around 75 billion of which are funded while around 225 billion euros are in the form of loans; this figure also includes around 10 billion euros to fill the missing links for gas and LNG and up to 2 billion euros for new LNG transport and storage infrastructure to end the current reliance on a single source of supply. The rest of the funding (95%) is earmarked for accelerating and boosting the transition to clean energy.

## Fitfor55

The package — in addition to including the above-mentioned goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 — aims to reform the EU ETS, making it more ambitious. The European Union Emissions Trading System is a cap and trade scheme, capping emissions for high-energy industries and for the energy production sector, who can trade their emission allowances. It is the EU's main tool for addressing emissions reductions. The new provisions include extending the system to include shipping emissions; a faster reduction of emission allowances in the trading system and the phasing out of free allowances for certain sectors; implementation of the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA); and more money to go into the Modernization Fund and Innovation Fund. In addition, a new independent emission allowances trading scheme is created for buildings, road transport and fuels for other sectors, which are not currently included in the system. The formal revision of the EU ETS was completed in April 2023.

Policies at the European level have reframed the issue of ecological transition and climate policies at the national and local levels: this is not only due to the funding provided but also through advocacy activities and citizen involvement.

## Policies at a national level

In line with European directives, Italy has fallen into line with the Commission's goals, issuing numerous Plans around energy and the environment that tie in with the EU's. Below is a description of the main plans, based on their level of relevance and alignment with the goals already covered.

## Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan- INECP

In January 2020, the text of the Plan was published, following the concerted efforts of the Italian Ministry For Economic Development, the Environment and Transport. This Plan implements the new rules contained in Italy's Climate decree, as well as the guidelines set out in the Green New Deal and already included in Italy's 2020 Budget Bill. The INECP sets national 2030 targets for energy efficiency, renewables and the reduction of CO2 emissions, as well as goals in terms of energy security, interconnections, a single energy market and competitiveness, sustainable mobility and development, outlining the measures for each that will be implemented to ensure the respective goals are reached. Italy is expected to issue legislative decrees over the course of 2020 and subsequent years for the implementation of the Plan in line with European directives. The proposal to update the Plan was submitted to the European Commission in July 2023 and is currently being examined.

Regions and local governments (including the City of Padova) also provided input in the drafting of the draft to make it consistent with the goals that, at the local level, cities and governments are pursuing.

## National plan to keep gas use down

The promotion of environmentally aware and responsible behaviours to enable reliance on fossil fuels to be scaled back in the medium/long term is one of the cornerstone goals at a national level. To save gas and avoid depleting national reserves, partly in light of the approaching 2023-2024 season, the Plan — which was approved in October 2022 — is in line with the European Commission guidelines, recently set out in Regulation (EU) 2022/1369 dated 5 August 2022. The guiding document, drawn up by the Italian ministry for the environment and energy security (MASE), confirms the commitments in the Plan as an integral part of the pathway to decarbonization by 2030 to increase Italy's energy self-sufficiency.

Since the publication of the Ministerial Decree in October 2022, the City of Padova has launched an energy-saving awareness campaign aimed at both its employees and the entire citizenry.

## National vehicle charging infrastructure plan

Italy's national plan implements European Directive 2014/94 and covers the production of EV charging infrastructure networks, as well as measures to salvage building stock with a view to developing said networks. It also sets the goal of ensuring the organic development of EV charging facilities across Italy, based on objective criteria that take into account the actual need in the different areas of the country. For the various actors involved in the sector's electrification, this plan is an ambitious vehicle charging infrastructure development programme, thus promoting and adopting sustainable mobility solutions. The plan was put into effect by Italian law 134/2012; it was last published on 30 June 2016 and is currently being updated by the relevant departments.

The Italian decree of 16 March 2023, which was gazetted on 22 May 2023, is an important step for Italy towards the completion of its national electric vehicle charging plan (PNiRE), namely Italy's national database of charging infrastructure (PUN). The national database of charging infrastructure (PUN) $^{11}$ is a public information system designed to allow the EV charging service's end users, as well as other stakeholders, to gain access to specific information. Essentially, it is a centralized register of charging points, which can be accessed by the public and other stakeholders, with the

O

aim of making the market more transparent and encouraging both public and private initiatives in the electric mobility field.

Consistent with the guidelines of the plan, the City of Padova and stakeholders operating in the municipal area are investing significant resources in fleet electrification and respective infrastructure.

## National Recovery and Resilience Plan– NRRP

In line with the goals outlined by the European Commission, the Italian NRRP is structured into six Missions + a seventh specifically referring to the REPowerEU plan. Two of the Missions are particularly significant for climate transition (Green revolution and ecological transition and Infrastructure for sustainable mobility), while the others, despite having different focuses, still cross-cut the climate theme (for example, Digitalization and Education and research). Approved in July 2021, the Plan is an integral part of Next Generation EU, the economic recovery project launched by the European Commission in 2021 to support the EU Member States. Overall, the Plan is worth a total of 194.4 billion euros. The measures originally planned supplement the goals set out in the European REPowerEU plan for the reduction of reliance on fossil fuels and the creation of skills aimed at mainstreaming renewable energy generation.

The City of Padova benefits from about 615 million distributed mainly among Missions 2 (Green Revolution and Ecological Transition), 4 (Territorial Cohesion and Inclusion) and 5 (Education and Research): see the Investment Plan in section B2 for more details.

## National Energy Strategy- NES

The Plan represents the Italian government's ten-year strategy to anticipate and manage energy system change. It is the result of a complex and shared process that has involved not just public bodies operating in the energy field, but the actual electricity and gas grid operators as well. Once discussed among industry operators, the proposal was put up for public consultation for three months, with a high level of participation: over 250 submissions were received from a range of associations, businesses, public bodies, citizens and university exponents, for a total of 838 feedback points and opinions on different topics.

The targets the Plan has set out to achieve are as follows:

Energy efficiency: reducing consumption from 118 to 108 Mtoe by 2030
Increasing renewable energy consumption to 28% by 2030
Phasing out the production of coal-generated electricity with an accelerated target of 2025
Reducing reliance on foreign countries for energy from 76% in 2015 to 64% by 2030

The NES is a push to ramp up investments, driving the trend further with total additional investments amounting to 175 billion by 2030, which can be broken down as follows:

30 billion for gas and electricity networks and infrastructure;
35 billion for renewable energy;
110 billion for energy efficiency.

The strategy defined by the SEN is fully consistent with the objectives of policies and plans adopted by the municipal administration such as PAESC and PUMS.

## National Climate Change Adaptation Plan- NCCAP

The purpose of the Plan is to minimize the vulnerability of natural, social and economic systems to the impacts of climate change and build their resilience. It is the implementation instrument for the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (NCCAS) approved by the Italian Ministry for the Environment (with decree no. 86 of 16 June 2015) for national planning to support institutions that will be called to develop the contents of the Plan at their respective level of government. The aim is to offer a guiding instrument for the planning and implementation of more effective adaptation actions across Italy, based on the criticalities that have come to light, and for the integration of
COMUNE di PADOVA

O

adaptation criteria into existing procedures and planning instruments. The Plan is currently under SEA (Strategic Environmental Assessment). In line with the National Plan, the City of Padova has adopted the “Guidelines for the Construction of the Climate Change Adaptation Plan” since 2016. The Adaptation Plan was integrated into the SECAP, which was approved by the City Council in June 2021.

## Green Transition Plan

Italy's national Green Transition Plan (GTP) responds to the challenge that the European Union has set before the Member States with its Green Deal: deliver growth that safeguards health, sustainability and planetary wellbeing, through the implementation of a series of social, environmental, economic and political measures whose goals are climate neutrality, zero pollution, climate change adaptation, restoring biodiversity and ecosystems, transition to a circular economy, and bioeconomy.

Subject to regular updates, the Plan, in accord with the planning guidelines set out by the NRRP, seeks to fully achieve the goals by 2050, as largely set out in Italy's national Long-Term Strategy. More specifically, the themes outlined and covered in the Plan can be broken down into:

Decarbonization
Sustainable mobility
Improving air quality
Addressing land take and hydrogeological instability issues
Improving water resources and relevant infrastructure
Restoring and strengthening biodiversity
Protecting the sea
Promoting the circular economy, bioeconomy and sustainable farming.

CITE (the interministerial committee for green transition) approved the Plan in March 2022. In line with the goals of the GTP, the municipal administration has included the concept of ecological transition in all plans adopted in recent years (see the next section "Municipal-level policies").

## Policies at a regional level

The main climate policies adopted by the Veneto Regional Council over the last few years are presented below.

## Regional Energy Plan

The Regional Council passed a decree on 29/03/2022 (DGR no. 313) for work to start on drawing up the new Regional Energy Plan and for an update of energy sector policies and planning.

In line with the policy goals identified at a European level and with the national guidelines given by the INECP (Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan) and GTP (Green Transition Plan), the new Regional Energy Plan sets out new guidelines and planning coordination principles for the promotion of renewables and energy saving and determines the regional strategic decisions, policies and measures required to achieve the planned goals, based on an integrated energy and climate approach. Given the cross-cutting nature of the theme, the Veneto Regional Council is taking steps to shore up collaborative relationships with a wide range of entities, such as GSE (state-owned company promoting renewable energy), RSE (energy research body), ENEA (Italian national agency for new technologies, energy and sustainable economic development), and Terna (grid operator).

The Municipality of Padova also has an Energy Plan, which was included in the SECAP, approved in 2021, and an Energy Manager's Office, which is mandatory under Law 10/1991 for entities operating in the civil, tertiary and transportation sectors that had an energy consumption of more

The RTP —approved by the Regional Council in July 2020 with resolution no. 75 — is a handbook for setting out a new mobility and logistics planning process to see the region into 2030, one designed to identify the region's needs, decide on and execute infrastructure measures based on technically and economically feasible projects, and promote technological innovations and transformations resulting from the decisions made. The regional transport policy comprises eight goals and eight strategies, relating to future projects and/or projects currently being assessed, and 37 actions relating to improved use of existing infrastructure.

The Plan's total projected costs are expected to be in the region of 21 million euros, 13 million of which are currently covered by regional, state and European funding, in addition to an injection of private capital. The city of Padova, as the crossroads of the main regional arteries, will benefit from major consolidation of the railway network through the modernization of the Brescia-Padova high-speed network.

# Regional bicycle mobility plan- PRMC

The PRMC is a planning instrument that falls under the Regional Transport Plan. The Regional Council drew up the Plan in December 2020, in collaboration with the road network company Veneto Strade SpA. The backbones of the regional cycle path network and main routes to be produced will be determined through this Plan, along with the extension of existing routes, thus creating a network of coordinated and synergistic cycleways, not just to meet the relevant new statutory requirements — which call for the development of a specific planning instrument — but also to promote and develop cycling tourism in the Veneto region so as to coordinate with the numerous other initiatives already under way. The Bici Masterplan of the City of Padova represents an attempt at vertical integration with respect to the Regional Plan.

# Coordinating spatial plan for the Veneto region- PTRC

The PTRC is a regional governing instrument that sets out goals and key principles to determine how land in the regional area is to be organized and shaped, as well as strategies and actions for the delivery of relevant outcomes. It is an instrument designed to support territorial governance in both general planning and sector-specific planning in environmental, economic and social fields; it analyses the strengths and weaknesses of each and highlights potential and opportunities for local entities and for territorial systems. The PTRC was approved on 30 June 2020 with Regional Council resolution no. 62. As for the Padova area, the Plan focuses on the strategy for the development and planning of the hill area of the Berici Mountains, the Euganean Hills and the plain area between Padova and Vicenza.

# Regional Municipal and Special Waste Management Plan

An update to the Regional Municipal and Special Waste Management Plan was approved by Regional Council decree (DGR no. 988 dated 09/08/2022), setting the regional target of 84% source-separated waste by 2030. The Plan sets out scenarios for the generation and management of municipal waste for the full 2020-2030 ten-year period, incorporating innovative concepts introduced by new European and national guidelines for the coming decades, and associating actions with each goal for its delivery. The main new aspect to come out of these scenarios is the key role played in reducing the generation of municipal waste and implementing the product life cycle approach, encouraging the creation of reuse/recycling centres region-wide so as to intercept goods that can be reused, and make citizens aware of the opportunity to hand in goods that are still

intact and in working order so that they can then be reused, rather than throwing them out as waste. The main contents of the existing management plan have also been updated, including looking into existing treatment, disposal and recycling plants and consequently identifying locations that are not suitable for said plants, defining a reward system taking into account available resources, information campaigns and the dissemination of information addressing the public or specific categories of consumers. The Plan also encompasses the remediation of contaminated areas across the whole regional area. The objectives of the Plan have been adopted by the Padova Center Basin Consortium, of which the City of Padova is a member.

## Regional Climate Change Adaptation Strategy

In 2021, the Regional Council embarked on a path to define climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies designed to positively shape sector-specific planning, regulatory and legislative activity and the Regional Council's own administrative activity.

With the Regional Economy and Finance Document for the 2022-24 three-year period — with specific reference to the 09.09.02 target — work was started on the preparation of the Regional Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (RCCAS) for the Veneto Region. Subsequently, the Regional Council passed a decree (DGR no. 771 dated 27 June 2023) to set up the Regional Coordinating Steering Group for Climate Change Adaptation to oversee work —initiated with another Regional Council decree (DGR no. 705 dated 14 June 2022) — on formulating the Regional Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.

The Regional Council elected to enlist the collaboration of the Veneto environmental protection agency (ARPAV) and the universities of Venice — Iuav and Ca' Foscari — to assess the risks, vulnerabilities and impacts resulting from climate change, to plan adaptation actions and to identify intervention priorities. ARPAV has also developed a platform for viewing and downloading future climate data.

The Veneto Regional Council adopted the preliminary Regional Climate Change Adaptation Strategy document with Regional Council resolution (DGR) no. 459 dated 02/05/2024. Before going before the Regional Council for final approval, the Strategy is being put up for public consultation. The City of Padova contributed to the definition of the Regional Strategy, participating in thematic tables and presenting its SECAP at the regional level as a good practice.

## Policies at a local level

The main climate policies adopted by the local government over the last few years are presented below.

## Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan

The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan $^{12}$ was adopted by the City Council in June 2021. It comprises mitigation and adaptation strategies and actions with a 2030 target and was compiled as part of the Covenant of Mayors initiative, thus updating the previous existing SEAP, whose goals and actions proved obsolete at that point. With the new SECAP, the City Council aims to halve $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions compared with the base year (2005). The SECAP is a strong measure towards achieving climate neutrality by 2030 as it highlights real-world actions to be rolled our, sorted by specific sectors/actions (the Plan includes 83 mitigation actions and 33 adaptation actions). It also contains the definition of the city's emissions baseline, which is the starting point for defining an actionable pathway to climate neutrality. The Plan's first Monitoring Report, relating to the year 2021, was approved in 2023.

# Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan

The SUMP — Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan produced by the joint local government committee for the metropolitan area of Padova¹³ (Co.Me.Pa.) — seeks to promote a shared vision of sustainable mobility policies at an intermunicipal level, to build a series of directions that clearly and efficiently engage the various local governments involved in defining and implementing the measures to be applied. The geographical range of Padova's SUMP extends beyond the administrative boundary of the municipal capital, Padova, dealing with the 18 local governments within Padova's intermunicipal area as defined in the Co.Me.Pa. agreement: this decision was dictated by the city's strong interdependence with its surrounding area and by its need to put together a wide-ranging plan that would engage the whole territory. The Plan was adopted by the City Council in January 2020. The first monitoring report on its current progress was completed in 2024.

# Municipal Green Spaces Plan

To make urban green spaces planning more efficient, local governments across Italy have been invited to draw up a "Green spaces plan": a voluntary instrument — part of each government's wider city planning — that defines the city's "green profile", starting with its basic natural ecosystems, with planned measures to develop and enhance urban and peri-urban green spaces. This is a strategic instrument designed to steer local city planning transformation policies and the local government's resulting decisions on public green spaces, defining principles and setting guiding criteria for the creation of public green spaces. The Plan¹⁴ was drawn up with the aid of a participatory process involving specific local stakeholders, such as trade associations, professional orders, business operators and environmental associations, as part of the Agenda 21 scheme.

The Plan was ultimately adopted on 28 March 2022 with resolution no. 2022/029.

# Piano degli Interventi - PI (city planning intervention plan)

The Piano degli Interventi (PI) governs the municipal area's built form and urban development in general. Relevant parties can refer to the tool, via an interactive platform, to analyse intended land use, constraints and regulations to be applied to a specific area within the city boundary. The Plan is valid for 5 years, following approval by the City Council with resolution no. 6 dated 12/02/2023, putting it into effect on 10 March 2023. The PI also outlines city planning schemes for implementation (PUA).

As indicated in the Operational Technical Standards (Heading I, Section I, Art. 1), the "Padova 2030" PI, in line with the Mayoral document illustrated before the City Council on 1 March 2021, is divided into the following goals:

a) Environmentally responsible use of land and safety of land
b) Urban forestation and green and blue belts
c) Regeneration and urban quality
d) Public and polycentric city
e) Appeal of the old city centre and heritage across the city
f) Research, training, innovation, production
g) Sustainable mobility.

These goals are aimed at better protecting the quality of the area and its architectural heritage and at making better use of available resources through strategies for the redevelopment, improved utilization and renewal of the land and urban fabric.

## Building Regulations - BR

The building regulations, throughout the whole municipal area, regulate each activity that results in a change in the urban and building makeup, and contains provisions for the protection of environmental and architectural values, for the visual appearance and the quality of urban development and building, and for citizens' health and safety. Padova's Building Regulations¹⁵ were amended with City Council resolution no. 38/2024 and came into effect on 20 July 2024. The main new changes introduced by the Regulations concern:

the introduction of guidelines to foster greater clarity and promote greater uniformity of practices by trade professionals;
the option of installing PV solar panels both built into and mounted on top of roofs. For the old city centre, operational guidelines have been introduced to identify solutions that do not alter the building's architectural features;
the introduction of more precise explanations and general supplementary guidelines designed to help make it easier to restore existing building stock, which includes encouraging the addition of new technologies without detriment to the buildings' features, including their appearance.

## Economic and Financial Plan for municipal waste management

As of 2021, the new rules and regulations issued by the Italian energy and environmental regulation authority (ARERA) to determine the costs of the integrated municipal waste management service call for providers to have an economic and financial plan in place to cover the matters that fall under their remit. The body responsible for validating the documents within the city of Padova is the "Padova Centro" council for the Padova catchment area, which was established recently and has been fully operational since 2022. Within the municipal area, the integrated municipal waste management department has a contract with AcegasApsAmga SpA, which is also the company that manages commercial waste charges and user relations. The document covers the 2022/2025 three-year period relating to all services delivered by the company, from the kerbside collection of municipal waste to relevant transport and street cleaning.

## Environmental and Sustainability Report

In December 2023, Padova Council approved the 14th edition of its Environmental and Sustainability Report: this is a voluntary sustainability policy governance and reporting instrument that provides decision-makers with essential information for shaping policy lines and making the best management decisions to assess the effects of the Body's planning endeavours and health of the city in terms of climate and sustainability actions and investments.

From the 2018 edition on, it has also reported on the city's contribution to meeting the so-called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the UN Agenda 2030. The Report is divided up into 13 areas: 8 environment-related areas, in addition to 5 more specific areas of a social and economic nature. In addition, there is a special section assessing the Body's direct impacts, which includes consumption, emissions and the Green Purchasing Plan.

## Guidelines for the promotion and implementation of "PADOVA 2030" renewable and socially responsible energy communities

Padova Council approved its "Guidelines for the promotion and implementation of "PADOVA 2030" renewable and socially responsible energy communities" with Council resolution no. 2023/0087 dated 7 March 2023. This document identifies the possible roles that a local body can take on in

promoting RECs (as a promotor of energy sharing, as a promotor of an REC, as a member of an existing REC, as an entity that makes its assets available). The document also defines the stages involved in setting up an REC (planning, programming, design, execution, running).

The guidelines are one of the first outcomes delivered through the "PADOVA 2030" REC Technical board, which was officially established in March 2023.

The following table summarizes the main policies discussed so far.

The table below, Table A-2.1, gives the emissions contributions linked to policies and actions included in plans and programmes that have been approved in recent years by Padova Council as illustrated in Table A-2.1 "Description of policies". The data given in column (3) reveal that the "Reduction in emissions through other existing Action Plans" comes to 168,017 tonnes of CO2. This is the contribution quantified in the SECAP actions that have not yet been taken (or have been taken only partially) as at 2021 and planned for the period from 2021 to 2030. Some actions previously included in the SECAP have been fully extrapolated from the Plan and included among the actions in the Climate City Contract Portfolio. Indeed, there was a desire to give greater emphasis and reiterate the importance of some strategic actions that at the time of writing the Climate City Contract had not yet been initiated but had already been assumed during the drafting of the SECAP. This avoids the

Column (1) of the table shows the emissions of the base year illustrated earlier in Module A-1, amounting to a total of 1,283,174 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$; while column (2) gives the forecast 2030 reduction target with the goal of climate neutrality (-80%), which is the equivalent of 1,026,540 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Column (3), as just mentioned, summarizes the contributions resulting from actions already included in existing Plans. The gap shown in column (4) thus gives the additional emissions contribution (in addition to actions already planned in the SECAP) required to achieve climate neutrality. Column (5) gives the value of the emissions reduction as a result of climate neutrality portfolio actions covered in module B-2, including strategic actions. The sum of the portfolio actions (module B-2) and strategic actions proposed by the local government and entered in table B-2.3 is enough to completely fill the gap. Column (6) gives the value of residual emissions, calculated as the difference between the base year emissions and the 2030 reduction target of 80%. It is worth noting that in column (1), the negative contribution of the AFOLU sector — calculated in the baseline inventory (-11,534 tCO₂) — reduces the total base year emissions overall. Consequently, the sum of the reduction targets in column (2) and residual emissions in column (6) does not give the value indicated on the "Total" line. Issues in parentheses refer to compensatory actions.

# 6.3. Module A-3 Systemic barriers and opportunities to 2030 climate neutrality

The aim of this module is to identify systemic barriers and opportunities that the city of Padova has tackled or will have to tackle on its path to climate neutrality. The analysis given here is a starting point for planning actions that tackle these barriers and are able to capitalize on opportunities geared towards climate neutrality.

## A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

### Barriers to climate neutrality

The climate neutrality challenge is inextricably linked to other issues entrenched in Padova, including air pollution (a problem we share with many other cities within the Padova district catchment area) and, more recently, the impacts of climate change (above all, drought, heatwaves, flooding and the spread of tropical and subtropical diseases). Many of the actions included in the Climate City Contract can be effective on a number of fronts (mitigation and adaptation). For example, replacing old boilers with new heat pump models integrated with PV systems can simultaneously reduce final energy use and pollutant emissions, while resulting in more comfortable and liveable interiors despite adverse weather and climate conditions.

Taking into consideration only criticality factors that can be associated with energy consumption, it is very clearly necessary to focus our efforts on end-use electrification (both in the mobility sector, and in the residential, commercial, institutional and industrial buildings sector). However, this conversion has to contend with grid infrastructure limitations, with the need for significant funding and the opportunity to manage energy consumption and generation based on innovative smart grid models. Furthermore, while heat pumps can be an important resource for reducing air pollution, these very units result in considerable criticalities in terms of heat loss to the external environment, exacerbating the heat island effect. Signing a memorandum of understanding with the local electricity distributor (Enel Distribuzione) is key to ensuring significant investments are made into the municipality, to adapt the existing grids to the city's changing needs.

On the mobility front, there is a very evident urgent need to reduce individual movements to limit congestion issues and accident rates on main roads. The mere electrification of the fleet on the road, while significantly reducing air and noise pollution, is not a solution to what are often critical traffic conditions, to the "misuse" of urban space — which could be otherwise converted to a public amenity space for socializing — or to the loss of permeable surfaces, which increases risks associated with extreme weather events. Nonetheless, the idea of curtailing people's "freedom" to move around is met with strong resistance to change amongst the city's residents and business operators. From this point of view, it will be important to implement communication campaigns to tell people about the change in progress and facilitate the transition to new forms of mobility, engaging citizens and businesses through reward schemes and inclusive information.

A barrier that cuts across all areas of the Climate City Contract is the difficulty in engaging the various different municipal Departments and local stakeholders with a view to making coordinated collective decisions. To overcome this critical barrier, the Municipality of Padova has formed the in-house interdepartmental Task Force as well as the Living Lab to get all actors and socioeconomic entities and manufacturers involved. These tools can be a real solution to the

governance of the climate neutrality process, but require significant human resources and strong political legitimation. Furthermore, participatory processes must be structured for longevity (we need to define spaces and places, we need to identify facilitators and coordinators for the different processes, etc.). Another cross-cutting barrier within the City is the lack of specific technical expertise, with it sometimes being complicated for local government personnel to keep up to date and engage in research. To overcome this barrier, the Municipality of Padova has signed a collaborative agreement with the University of Padova, which has the cross-cutting skills required to be able to support the Municipality in making the best decisions for the city's decarbonization.

Another obstacle in the way of actually meeting the Mission goals lies in the difficulty in reaching citizens effectively and across the board, given that citizens are increasingly a linchpin in terms of the adoption of good behaviours (at home, in workplaces, in waste management, etc.) and the investments they can make, possibly taking advantage of financial resources and tax benefits made available by local actors or higher-level bodies. Very often, citizens are on the receiving end of information that is contradictory, lacking in clarity and transparency, or constantly changing; this lowers their sensibility and attention threshold when it comes to sustainability issues: the aim of the local government is to build communication campaigns that are targeted in terms of both goals and audience, using a range of different channels.

City planning in the past has had little regard for working in balance with the natural ecosystem. In recent years, extreme weather (rainfall, drought, heatwaves) has intensified. According to the report from IPCC — the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — as the climate crisis deepens, we will see such events strike with increasing frequency and ferocity: this is what makes planning with the aid of NBS so key. There are a number of commendable examples already being implemented, including the work on Padova's Piazza Savelli, funded by the Italian ministry for the environment and energy security (formerly known as MiTE). All interventions planned as part of the Climate City Contract must incorporate climate change-friendly design and be informed by DNSH principles. The difficulty in restoring permeable urban surfaces and the lack of non-built space in central areas is undoubtedly a hindrance to the introduction of green solutions in the city.

The climate neutrality plan also needs significant public and private investments. While, in recent years, the City of Padova has been successful in attracting capital for the execution of certain strategic works (tram lines, "Bicipolitana" cycling network, public lighting, public housing, etc.), additional investments are required. The absence of substantial resources may be an unsurmountable barrier to meeting the expected goals. In the process of drawing up the Climate City Contract, the Municipality of Padova has engaged with the most active financial service providers in the local context in the co-design of certain actions financed by them through a range of different instruments (subsidized loans and mortgages, etc.). We have managed to formalize Climate Agreements with some banks.

Many of the strategic actions described in table B-2 have been built to attract and steer investments from private actors, defining a guidance framework and clear quantitative targets for the implementation of decarbonization projects and deployment of technological solutions.

Within the energy sector, the main barriers consist in:

high costs of initial capital required to carry out energy upgrading work on buildings,
difficulty in assessing the risk associated with energy price fluctuation/volatility,
potential difficulties faced by low-income families in accessing loans,
adapting the electricity network to suit widespread energy generation by small plants, to meet the electricity demand for all final uses and different ways of using electricity than in the past,

regulatory barriers to renovation work or the implementation of renewable energy in the old city centre (partially superseded with the amendments introduced by Padova's Building Regulations approved in June 2024), which could hinder the climate neutrality process.

The presence of a major industry player such as AcegasApsAmga among the Climate City Contract stakeholders guarantees the municipality the opportunity to forge strategic partnerships and synergies: the company represents the most important multi-utility in the Northeast area where it operates in environmental and water services, gas and electricity distribution, carries out energy upgrading projects and public lighting networks. The company can count on the experience of its parent company, Hera, a leader in the sector since 2002 throughout the country. In addition, the memorandum of understanding signed with ENEL Distribuzione will allow for an upgrade of the electricity grid to be able to meet the growing challenges of electrification of consumption and distributed generation. Finally, important agreements with trade associations in the construction industry and some financial operators guarantee continuous exchanges with the business world and the possibility of activating innovative projects to connect supply and demand.

When it comes to the transport sector, the main hurdles are:

substantial investments to produce mobility infrastructure,
difficulties in implementing intermodal fee systems (to encourage modal movements) and introducing new models for managing the range of mobility services,
little flexibility in planning instruments to change the form and function of urban spaces (with the goal of creating a 15-minute city),
slow pace of development of electric mobility infrastructure, with difficulties in managing the deployment of charge points in condominiums due to a lack of physical space and sometimes lengthy bureaucratical and decision-making processes,
high costs of electric vehicles, especially for residents in low-income bands,
cultural barriers that citizens face in giving up their private car as a travel option.

The development of local public transport is considered strategic by the city government, which is investing extensively in the sector to improve the appeal of Public Transport and provide the city with adequate infrastructure. Management of the same is in the hands of a public company, Busitalia, which is modernizing the fleet and focusing on electrification of the fleet. To ensure full intermodality, however, it will be necessary to involve all operators operating in Padova, including those in sharing mobility, and it will be necessary to involve and activate mobility management projects in public and private companies and schools.

In the waste sector, we have detected a number of barriers that Padova is committed to working on over the years of the Mission:

data collection needs to be scaled up,
target calculation methods need to be reviewed, taking into account not just the resident population, but the actual number of people living here,
waste-to-energy needs to be scaled up for heating purposes,
slow behavioural transformation, including cultural barriers and the need to adopt different approaches in different neighbourhoods of the city.

Waste management within the municipality is in the hands of AcegasApsAmga: the company is aiming to expand its waste sorting capacity through new collection centers and material valorization. The company's business model is based on the cardinal principle of the circular economy linked to the 5Rs or Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover and Regenerate.

# Stakeholder participation in the journey to climate neutrality

As already anticipated, many of the existing barriers can only be overcome through the full involvement of all stakeholders in the area and the citizenry. In Padova, there is a culture of participation and dialogue, introduced almost 20 years ago with the inception of the local Agenda 21 office within the Environment Department. Many plans and projects have been carried out with a participatory stage run by the Agenda 21 office, including the SECAP¹⁶ and the Green Spaces Plan¹⁷. Getting stakeholders and the general public involved is one of the commitments of the Covenant of Mayors and, for the SECAP, it was determined that this approach should be adopted right from the start when working out the project proposals and subsequently maintained during the implementation of the actions and their monitoring over time. The participatory process, within the Agenda 21 space, uses well-established tools like workshops and roundtables.

The local government also called for the main local actors to be engaged in drawing up the Climate City Contract in a collaborative governance approach: this is why it launched the "Padova 2030"¹⁸ participatory process that actively engages stakeholders in workshops and focus groups, in order to determine the main actions to be rolled out to reach climate neutrality.

The participatory process took place over the March-May 2023 period over six meetings structured around three thematic areas: (1) building stock upgrade and the generation of renewable energy, (2) sustainable mobility, (3) circular economy and waste management.

The actions and suggestions coming out of the participatory process were shared during the 2023 Forum on Energy and Sustainability organized by the Municipality of Padova and were subsequently incorporated into the Climate City Contract being drawn up.

Following the participatory process, bilateral meetings were set up with all participating stakeholders, as well as other parties who did not have the chance to attend the original meetings, to incorporate new input into the Plan or pave the way to defining and signing Climate Agreements. The stakeholders involved included trade unions, NGOs and local associations, representatives from different sectors of the economy, from the academic/research and innovation community, professional orders, businesses, financial service providers, etc. The stakeholders involved are public or private organizations interested in or with the power to influence the energy transition. The stakeholders contributed with:

feedback and input on barriers and opportunities to reach climate neutrality,
information on measures managed and/or implemented by them as part of the SECAP,
signing of Climate Agreements as part of the Climate City Contract.

In addition to technical stakeholders, various other categories of stakeholders identified during the participatory processes for engagement in the sharing of goals and identification of strategic projects to promote the city's resilience:

schools, as young people of all ages can be actively involved both by including specific educational modules in their school curriculum and through specific sustainability education initiatives. Each year, the Municipality of Padova offers projects and workshops on climate change and land management, and has established numerous collaborations with the University of Padova,
the community, as local action cannot be managed just by a group of organizations and associations, and instead requires the active involvement and contribution of citizens. As part of the Climate City Contract's participatory process, neighbourhood consultation¹⁹

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

meetings have been run to gather input, suggestions and ideas from participants on how to encourage greater engagement of these bodies in supporting and assisting the neighbourhood entities (schools, parishes, retailers), citizens and families in achieving the climate neutrality goal,

citizens targeted directly, who have been given the opportunity to present their ideas, proposals and actions (individually or through associations) to contribute to achieving climate neutrality, by filling out an online form²⁰.

The participatory process that has led to the drawing up and definition of the Climate City Contract does not end with the approval of the Plan; instead, it will remain an open, living document right through to 2030, through the regular organization of sessions for partners to share, exchange and collaborate, as part of the Agenda 21 and Padova Living Lab activities (for more details, see section C-1).

Table A-3.2 gives the list of stakeholders in the transition to climate neutrality. The list also includes both signatories of Climate Agreements and stakeholders involved in other activities that are complementary to the Climate City Contract work and hence relevant to the climate neutrality ambition, as well as participants in the participatory process who have not gone on to sign Agreements but have nonetheless actively contributed to identifying barriers and opportunities and to building the strategy. For each stakeholder, the table gives the level of influence — namely their ability to reduce the city's GHG emissions systemically to a lesser or greater degree (stakeholders operating over a number of sites or with systemic effects have greater influence) — as well as the level of interest, determined based on the level of involvement in the process.

and decisions concerning the individual neighbourhoods, in the management of the commons, and in the social and cultural life of the places in which they live and work.

# 7 Part B – Pathways to Climate Neutrality by 2030

This section is the central part of the Action Plan document: it illustrates the initiatives, programmes, scenarios, objectives, strategies and respective impacts that local authorities, external stakeholders and the entire ecosystem operating in the area have planned to achieve the climate neutrality goals by 2030.

Module B-1 outlines scenarios for achieving climate neutrality and their impact pathways based on the Theory of Change. These scenarios aim to recount how the municipality intends to close the emission gap shown in Table A-2.2 in column (4). Each impact pathway is assessed with respect to the direct and indirect benefits it is able to generate in the short and long term.

Module B-2 shows the portfolio of actions collected from public and private stakeholders, foundations and bodies operating in the area, which describe the commitment of the various actors involved in the participatory process and signatories of Climate Agreements (Tables B-2.2a / B-2.2b / B-2.2c). A specific section is dedicated to the 13 strategic actions for achieving climate neutrality goals that the Municipality of Padova has identified in a perspective to 2030. These actions, which are complementary to those included in the portfolio, represent a fundamental building block to concretely orient administrative actions and those of the entire region towards the total reduction of net climate-changing gas emissions. Table B-2.3 describes residual emissions, specifying the contribution from CO2 absorption by the city's trees and shrubs.

# 7.1. Module B-1 Climate neutrality scenarios and impact pathways

This Module is based on the Theory of Change proposed by NZC. The development of the theory can be useful for local government to focus on how change is expected to occur and how different actions and actors are linked and collectively contribute to achieving the desired impact goals. In a medium- to long-term context such as the one in which this document is set, this tool can be seen as a valuable framework for monitoring the progress of planned initiatives, helping to maintain focus on the results achieved, not to mention the revision of the strategy and actions where necessary. At the same time, this approach is intended to assist the city in describing the transition taking place and the planning processes underlying the actions included in the Plan.

Table B-1.1 shows 26 impact pathways divided into five fields of action. The impact pathways describe the ways (projects, actions, programmes) through which the Municipality of Padova and all stakeholders involved in the pathway and signatories of Climate Agreements aim to achieve climate neutrality. Direct impacts were calculated by summing the benefits from the portfolio of actions identified by stakeholders and listed in Tables B-2.2a / B-2.2b / B-2.2c with the additional benefits from the full implementation of the strategic actions identified by the municipal administration.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The 26 impact pathways illustrated show a systemic intervention for each field of action, and represent a paradigm shift. In fact, it involves applying a holistic cross-sectoral approach.

That which is written with respect to direct impacts refers to the total emissions per field of action collected during the dialogue phase between the Municipality and the various CCC participants through the signing of a Climate Agreement, which will be set out in greater detail in Tables B-2.2a / B-2.2b / B-2.2c and in the section on strategic actions.

In total, the 26 impact pathways will allow for a reduction of 857,006 tonnes of CO₂, which, together with the objectives of the existing strategies (those planned and included in the SECAP, approved by the City Council in 2021) – equal to 168,017 tonnes of CO₂ – will allow the municipality to reduce its emissions by almost 80% compared to 2021 (base year).

The most relevant sectors in terms of direct impacts are the Built Environment and Mobility, which together account for 87% of the emission gap reduction targets.

The goal for the city's future will be to transform Padova not only from the perspective of technology and climate change mitigation and adaptation, but also from a regulatory, social and cultural point of view.

# "Built Environment" field of action

A key theme of Padova's CCC concerns residential, commercial and institutional buildings and industry, which account for 76% of final energy usage in the city. Various measures are envisaged to drastically reduce climate-altering emissions, from the replacement of boilers and generators with electric heat pumps possibly powered by renewable sources, to the creation of a district heating network that can also make use of some thermal waste currently dissipated by the waste-to-energy plant, urban waste and local companies that have residual heat downstream of their production cycles.

In recent years, Padova has seen a rather high rate of building heritage redevelopment, with investments amounting to some 357 million euros mobilised thanks to the Superbonus 110 scheme (ENEA data updated to March 2023).

However, it is necessary to create the ideal conditions for the rate of redevelopment to remain high in the years to come. To achieve this goal, Padova Municipality, based on experience gained through its Energy Help Desk (Sportello Energia), aims to build a new One-Stop Shop: a public-private entity designed to bring together energy upgrade initiatives for residential, commercial, institutional and industrial buildings and to present private business operators (ESCOs) with investment package proposals, creating advantageous economies of scale and promoting Energy Efficiency Contracts.

Important urban regeneration projects have already been launched and financed by the NRRP (e.g. the Hub Arcella 2030 project – redevelopment of the San Carlo area), with a focus on all energy upgrades of the public social housing stock, which, involving families in relative poverty, can have important co-benefits, especially in relation to the growing problems associated with the phenomenon of heat waves in the summer. Attention to the most vulnerable will have to follow community-based rationales and risk-sharing among all actors in the value chain.

Finally, in the building sector, the Municipality is experimenting with innovative finance models (e.g. crowdfunding) in small pilot projects in the testing phase, applied to supermarkets and sports centres. Technological and building stock efficiency actions will be accompanied by information and communication actions for the benefit of the public and businesses. Moreover, a significant share of the electricity consumed is expected to be met with certified supplies from renewable sources.

% of the Climate City Contract target in terms of emission reduction (574,893 tonnes of CO2) is linked to this group of measures in the area of civil and industrial buildings.

# "Mobility and Transport" field of action.

The city transport sector, which accounts for 24% of final energy usage, is a key part of the decarbonization strategy. In order to reduce mobility-related emissions, action will be taken with a variety of integrated measures that will change the way people travel around the city. It is no coincidence, then, that 6 out of Padova's 13 Climate City Contract strategic actions concern transport.

Without a doubt the most important project is the city-wide tram network system - SMART, which will see the construction of two new lines and the connection with modal interchange systems on the outskirts of the city to help reduce the number of entries in the city. The new lines will add 23 km to the existing network, connecting all major city arteries and traffic hubs and moving up to 12,000 people per hour. It is estimated that thanks to the SMART project around 210 million kilometres travelled by endothermic vehicles can be avoided, with a considerable reduction in emissions in the area.

While very important, this project must necessarily be part of a broader strategy. The other measures aimed at improving mobility in Padova envisaged in the CCC are:

the gradual replacement of diesel buses in local public transport with new electric vehicles powered by renewable sources,
the promotion of cycling, through the full implementation of Padova's "Bicipolitana" and the widespread installation of bike racks and bike boxes, thanks to which the number of kilometres cycled annually is expected to increase by about 35%,
the implementation of mobility management policies through local companies and schools equipped with mobility managers and the promotion of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) through the full technological and pricing integration of the various alternative mobility systems to the car, and the identification of specific forms of rewards,
the creation of a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and the introduction of an Ultra LEZ, to progressively limit the circulation of the most polluting vehicles,
electrification of the private vehicle fleet, facilitated by incentives and the installation of charging points in cities.

The framework that thus emerges aims to change the way people travel around the city, on the one hand by guaranteeing citizens viable alternatives to the private car thanks to new infrastructures and services, and on the other by providing specific limitations to discourage particularly emissive and polluting means of travel. Technological and infrastructural actions will be accompanied by information and communication actions. Furthermore, it is expected that part of the new electricity consumption related to the transition of mobility towards the abandonment of internal combustion engines will be met with certified energy with a guarantee of origin from renewable sources.

% of the Climate City Contract target in terms of emission reduction (172,489 tonnes of CO2) is linked to this group of measures in the area of sustainable mobility and transport.

# "Energy Systems" field of action

The progressive installation of roof-mounted photovoltaic panels and the activation of Renewable Energy Communities should ensure an increase in the share of electricity needs met by locally produced renewables.

Legambiente's Renewable Municipalities study shows that in 2023 Padova was the city with the most photovoltaic installations per capita in Italy (around 15 MW installed in total). This extremely positive trend is expected to continue according to a linear trend, taking advantage of the available roof space on both civil and industrial buildings. The proliferation of the plants, with particular reference to the city centre, should be facilitated by easing legal and regulatory restrictions, protecting the landscape and the historical and cultural heritage of the City of Padova.

% of the Climate City Contract target in terms of emission reduction (98,952 tonnes of CO2) is linked to this group of measures in the area of energy systems.

"Waste and Circular Economy" field of action

On the waste front, the CCC provides for a progressive improvement in source-separated waste collection in the city, significantly reducing the percentage of non-separated waste and the procapita production of dry waste. For the "Padova Centro" council for the Padova catchment area (of which Padova Municipality is a member), the 2030 target is the production of 115 kg/person of residual waste and the achievement of 80% separate waste collection. The strategy to achieve these objectives envisages the construction of new collection centres and pre-treatment plants for recycled waste, the definition of differentiated policies for waste collection in the city, taking into account the different urban and morphological characteristics of the spaces available for the optimal provision of the service and taking into consideration the issues associated with the application in the city centre, and the provision of a pay-as-you-throw rate capable of incentivising the gradual reduction of non-separated waste, to be implemented at the same time as a better control of waste delivery, including through the encouragement of reuse and recycling and all waste prevention policies.

Information campaigns to support and accompany the full implementation of the measure are also planned in this field of action.

The benefit from these measures can be estimated at 9,167 tonnes of CO2 or 1.1% of the Climate City Contract target.

"Green infrastructure and NBS solutions" field of action

The Municipality is also extending the city's green spaces (Iris Park, Guizza Park, San Benedetto Walls Park, etc.) and, in recent years, has adopted a policy of boosting the tree population with initiatives such as the 10,000 trees for Padova project. Through the provisions of the Green Spaces Plan, the Municipality intends to continue with the planting of new trees. The full achievement of the Plan's objectives will be conditional on the implementation of de-paving and de-impermeabilisation of some of the city's grounds, such as Piazza Savelli, a car park redevelopment project in the Soft City area, financed by the former Ministry for Ecological Transition. The de-paving strategy was also included in the Piano degli Interventi, approved by Padova Council in 2023 with resolution no. 6/2023, in which it was assumed that approximately 930,000 square metres would be unsealed and transformed into permeable areas.

The availability of new areas may also derive from the application of urban equalisation, aimed at improving urban, landscape, architectural, energy, hydraulic and environmental quality through the recognition of a building capacity to entities that, by way of example, provide for the implementation of public interest projects, including urban forestation. The action of boosting the city's tree cover will allow for the absorption of 1,505 tonnes of CO2, or 0.2% of the Climate City Contract target.

## 7.2. Module B-2 Action Portfolio for Climate Neutrality

Producing a plan like the CCC requires a huge collective effort across the city, in which everyone is engaged and plays an active role. Hence, the Municipality of Padova started by coordinating a participatory process in which over 30 local stakeholders discussed and identified the main barriers and opportunities to achieving climate neutrality, eventuating in the signing of actual Climate Agreements in which each signatory has taken responsibility for implementing specific actions that will contribute to the city's decarbonization. A range of actions have been put in place: mitigation and adaptation, education and training, communication, research and development and financial support actions. To date, 36 Climate Agreements have been signed, with a wide range of different entities: universities, research centres and competence centres, multi-utilities and Council subsidiaries, through to private companies and startups, trade associations, third sector organizations, foundations and banks. Signing up to the CCC will remain voluntary and open to all, based on a permanent Living Lab approach.

The following tables contain the main projects and initiatives identified during the drafting of the Action Plan. The level of detail presented follows what is available from the signatory stakeholders of the Climate City Contract: information not present will be subject to future monitoring. In order to protect stakeholders, this document focuses on the emission impact of the projects: investment values and financial coverage will be clearly stated in the Investment Plan.

All actions are implemented within the municipal boundary of the city of Padova.

A total of 146 actions were identified, broken down as follows:

Table B-2.2a shows all 74 measurable actions (i.e. non-behavioural or policy actions) whose project is in progress, has already been completed or approved, and for which there are clear indications in terms of planning and timing, broken down by sector: 48 actions belong to the Buildings sector, 11 actions refer to the Transport sector, 4 to the AFOLU sector (considered as offsetting actions as part of the city's residual emission management strategy), 2 to the Waste sector, 9 to the Cross-Cutting sector, which refers to actions touching on several areas such as the purchase of green energy or incentives provided to companies undertaking sustainable projects in line with ESG criteria;
Table B-2.2b lists all the actions under study, i.e. those measurable projects for which the stakeholders do not yet have a detailed project and for which the timetable for implementation, the investment required and the characteristics of the intervention are not yet available, but for which a willingness to carry it out in the future has been expressed: these are 14 actions;
Table B-2.2c shows the behavioural actions of all partners involved, for a total of 58 actions involving training, events and the raising of knowledge, awareness and public participation with respect to climate neutrality issues (actions already in progress or related to future projects).

The detail of the tables is structured by giving a brief description of the action (for a more detailed description see Annex 1), the proposing stakeholder, the direct impacts of the action in terms of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq reduction, the timing of the action's implementation and finally the systemic levers activated. The following tables also show the actions for which insufficient data was available to estimate  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq emissions. Each action notes the "activated" systemic lever, i.e. the reference area that the action implements beyond the specific field of intervention: a maximum of three levers per action were selected to ensure readability of the table.

Overall, the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  reduction from actions in the stakeholders' portfolio (excluding planting actions that are part of the hard-to-abate emission abatement strategy - see section B-2.3) is 133,343 tCO $_2$ eq per year.

The following table outlines the 13 strategic actions that the Municipality has developed in consultation with local stakeholders who are signatories to the Climate Agreements, which are to be considered as a supplement to the portfolio measures for achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

The strategic actions include:

some measures in the process of full implementation (new tram lines, purchase of new electric buses for local public transport, construction of new cycle paths, gradual electrification of the vehicle fleet, replacement of heat generators with heat pumps, purchase of certified green energy),
other measures envisaged in municipal planning instruments and being implemented on an experimental basis or through pilot projects (activation of the One Stop Shop in Padova, promotion of Renewable and Solidarity Energy Communities, promotion of mobility management and MaaS),
others still at the preliminary study stage that will be implemented following a full technical-economic assessment and zoning of the project areas (new district heating networks, activation of a Low Emission Zone).

The full implementation of all 13 strategic actions and measures included in the Climate Agreements signed with local stakeholders focusing on the efficiency of structures, plants and processes, the promotion of sustainable forms of mobility that are alternative or complementary to the private car, the production of energy from renewable sources, and the purchase of the remainder through supply contracts with a guarantee of origin, will allow the full and balanced achievement of climate neutrality.

Focus: strategic actions to achieve climate neutrality

The analysis of the municipal emission picture (Module A-1 climate-altering emissions inventory) shows that all sectors play an important role in contributing to the emission of climate-altering gases into the atmosphere. Therefore, a plan that aspires to reduce the carbon footprint must include a number of measures and must focus on actions in all sectors under examination, from civil tertiary and residential to industry, transport and waste. Each action is detailed with a timetable of the activities to be carried out, and is based on analyses or results already achieved in previous studies or area development projects.

In addition to the specific measures already included in the portfolio (Tables B-2.2), this strategic action intends to provide for further developments through the activation of the One Stop Shop in Padova. The redevelopment of the private building stock is not easily controllable by a public administration. The only tool a municipality has is the possibility of establishing minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings, or, in the case of major renovations, through Building Regulations.[21] However, the technological maturity of the solutions adopted and the European and national regulations would be sufficient to guarantee the achievement of significant results in the aforementioned areas. However, the majority of the existing building stock has not been upgraded due to barriers that are frequently of a non-technological nature (regulatory limitations in historical areas, difficulties in reaching consensus in condominium meetings, lack of awareness and

information on existing technological and tax opportunities).

In the PadovaFIT Expanded European project $^{22}$ the Municipality of Padova experimented with the activation of an Energy Help Desk $^{23}$ to create a link between demand and supply of building renovation in the civil and industrial sectors, ensuring an acceleration in the rate of refurbishment. Following the first test phase, with  $100\%$  public management, an assessment was made of the possibility of setting up a new public-private entity (to be defined based on a feasibility study to be completed in 2024) capable of aggregating energy redevelopment projects in civil (residential and tertiary) and industrial buildings and of proposing investment packages to private economic operators (ESCo), creating advantageous economies of scale. Through these operations of aggregation and contracting by lots, it is possible to guarantee the achievement of specific performance levels through the signing of energy performance contracts, grouping together projects that are more or less "profitable" for the market and favouring the inclusion of the most vulnerable segments of the population (households suffering energy poverty).

The operation of the new One Stop Shop in Padova (starting in 2025) will be conditional on the completion of several ongoing projects:

the Cooling Down $^{24}$  project (to be completed in 2025), in which the University of Padova is participating, which is developing an urban energy planning tool with a focus on the city centre, modelling the state of affairs and assessing the benefits associated with possible redevelopment and energy production from renewable sources, with particular reference to cooling uses and in response to the growing problems associated with the formation of heat islands in the summer,
the PadovaXChange project $^{25}$  (to be completed in 2024), which is developing a digital twin of the industrial area of Padova aimed at simulating the effectiveness of energy efficiency measures for structures and plants, with a focus also on distribution networks,
the Let's GOv project $^{26}$  (to be completed in 2025), carried out together with the other Italian cities of the Climate Neutral Cities Mission, focused on the identification of governance tools able to govern the energy transition process, with a focus by Padova on the use of the One Stop Shop to facilitate the establishment of RECs.

Through the One Stop Shop in Padova, it is estimated that  $20\%$  of residential housing units (about 20,000), tertiary buildings (about 415, equal to 900,000 square metres) and industrial buildings (about 200 - equal to about 1,000,000 square metres) can be fully redeveloped by 2030, with:

a  $50\%$  reduction in the gross thermal energy demand of the civil buildings involved,
a  $30\%$  reduction in the gross thermal energy demand of the industrial buildings,
total electrification of consumption (from gas boilers to electric heat pumps) with increased efficiency of generation systems,
a  $20\%$  reduction in the electricity needs of civil buildings,
a  $20\%$  reduction in the electrical demand of industrial buildings.

In order to verify the effectiveness of some technologies applicable in the building sector and experimented through the One Stop Shop, Padova Municipality will benefit from the results obtained from the tests carried out in the UniZeb pilot building, inaugurated in May 2024 by the University of Padova with the collaboration of the building school.

Among the solutions to encourage greater penetration of thermal renewables in the existing building stock, projects based on low-enthalpy open and closed loop geothermal technology are spreading alongside solar thermal, which is already widely used. The closed circuit can be encouraged/promoted in small buildings (detached houses, small apartment blocks) with available

outdoor space (gardens, etc.) for drilling and probe installation. These are systems with a short authorisation process. In the case of larger buildings with less available space, the construction of open-loop systems with pick-up and return will be encouraged, though limited by authorisation procedures that often take longer than 12 months. Geothermal heat pumps can be supplemented with air-water/air-air pumps. The promotion of such solutions might be envisaged when revising the municipal building regulations. This measure is fully consistent with the new targets set by the Case Green Directive recently approved by the European Parliament.

## 2. Electrification of the vehicle fleet

In addition to the measures already included in the portfolio (Tables B-2.2), this strategic action focuses on accelerating the electrification of the private vehicle fleet. Reducing traffic flows and the number of kilometres travelled annually by cars and commercial vehicles are priority objectives of the Padova SUMP and the Climate City Contract, which can be achieved by strengthening local public transport services (road and rail), reinforcing the cycling strategy and capitalising on the opportunities offered by alternative sharing mobility systems and MaaS solutions. At the same time, consideration must be given to the remaining private car traffic, in respect of which it is important to define a strategy for the progressive electrification of the vehicle fleet through incentive policies (already in place at the national level$^{27}$), the construction of the necessary infrastructure in the region (with widespread and integrated recharging systems) and raising awareness among the public and businesses. Electric cars made up only a small percentage of the registered fleet in 2021 (0.3% according to ACI data), but through the combination of the Climate City Contract proposals and government incentives they are expected to increase significantly by 2030, with an additional 20,000 electric vehicles on the road (or 12% of the registered vehicle fleet, taking the total number in 2021 as a reference).

Electric vehicles still have a high price, which slows down their dissemination. Increased maturity of the technologies should lead to lower prices in the coming years. The purchase cost is an important barrier for less affluent households. Specific financial products or national/regional incentives (see the government incentives launched in June 2024 - Ecobonus and the Veneto Region incentives) will be promoted to support the less affluent strata of the population.

The cost of recharging remains high for all those who cannot connect their vehicle in their private home/building (due to a lack of recharging points or connections): the price can be as high as 0.80-1.00 €/kWh, about three times the cost of residential electricity. the Municipality is committed to a greater involvement of the trader-companies that install the columns, in order to obtain a recharging service at a capped price, around 50 cents per kWh, currently considered as the cross-over price of

COMUNE di PADOVA

O

kWh with respect to the thermal carrier. Roaming difficulties between operators, i.e. the possibility of using a column with the card or app of another operator, will also have to be managed.

The infrastructure of charging points is still an element to be implemented in the city. In the CCC it is planned to increase the number of charging points by a further 500 by 2030 through new agreements with the industry, trade associations and companies, sports centres, shopping centres, park-and-ride facilities, etc. Charging points maximise their effectiveness when installed in places where vehicles stay for many hours (work and leisure places) during the day, i.e. at times of peak photovoltaic production. With the RES Padova project (financed by the EUCF programme), it is planned to involve sports centres in the installation of photovoltaic systems coupled with electric vehicle charging points for the use of members/frequent users.

With a view to fostering the electrification of travel, the municipality plans to activate the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) in the central area of the city, which is already designated as a limited-traffic zone. This measure is more selective in nature than the LEZ and is being tested in more densely urbanised areas, where the impacts of pollutants on human health are more significant. It is therefore a matter of circumscribing areas in the city where mobility (both private and freight) must be allowed using electrically driven vehicles, cargo bikes, bicycles, etc., thus inhibiting the access and transit of endothermic vehicles. A further stimulus to the spread of electric vehicles could be the possibility of exempting the cost of recharging in the charging bays dedicated to electric car owners, maintaining only the parking fee (or defining a single all-inclusive fee that incentivises the use of electric vehicles), thanks to agreements with the companies-traders that install the charging stations to reduce the kWh cost. A feasibility study will be commissioned to assess the potential costs and benefits of measures for the deployment of electric vehicles in the city.

The spread of electric vehicles can also be aided by a communication and awareness-raising campaign aimed at the public and industry, with the aim of making people realise the potential benefit for the community of using an electric car (both environmentally and economically, considering the entire useful life of the vehicle) and the benefits for the driver (driving comfort, no noise, etc.).

# 3. District heating of civil and industrial buildings

This action, included in the portfolio (table B-2.2a), envisages the construction of new district heating networks to serve areas of the city with high potential, e.g. in the vicinity of the waste-to-energy plant or other plants that generate and dissipate thermal energy, or in areas with constraints that make it difficult to implement other projects, such as the city centre, where the penetration of other renewable sources is hindered by building and town-planning constraints. District heating networks can be powered:

by open-circuit low-enthalpy geothermal plants (with wells that could be built in city parks or car parks, for example);
by exploiting the heat dissipated by the waste-to-energy plant: in this vein, there are already project guidelines that direct the use of this energy for the benefit of the new hospital complex in Padova;
exploiting waste heat from wastewater networks,
exploiting waste heat from technological plants serving local companies and high-performance plants (data centres, supermarkets, manufacturing, etc.).

Geothermal systems, possibly built in city car parks (through the installation of coils), could take advantage of the high temperatures that are reached in the summer by the materials used for road surfaces, accumulating heat in the ground to be reused in the winter. This measure could be part of a larger project to adapt all city car parks, which are currently highly critical areas with respect to both heat island formation and extreme rainfall management.

The construction of district heating networks is subject to the definition of a feasibility study highlighting potential benefits, constraints, and limitations to the development and the heat sources supporting them. The study will have to indicate the areas that can benefit from district heating as a priority, both in terms of the users that can be connected and the predisposition of the thermal distribution plants for these users (demand analysis), and in terms of the development of the networks and the location of the supply plants. Within the framework of the PadovaXChange $^{28}$ project, focused on the development of a digital twin of the industrial area of Padova, some member companies and signatories of the Climate Agreements have already shown interest in the potential construction of mini district heating networks. Further heat exchange opportunities are being studied by other companies in the area (e.g. Officine Ferrari in connection with the Padova2000 sports centre).

The development of district heating in the historic centre with geothermal plants is conceivable through the construction of open loop wells in non-urbanised parks/lots within or on the edge of the centre (e.g. Fistomba Park). Numerous closed- and open-circuit geothermal systems have been implemented in recent years in Padova in public and private buildings:

buildings of the University of Padova (former geriatric hospital; former Marzolo canteen; former Piave barracks; departments of psychology and mathematics in Via Venezia/Via Trieste);
other buildings (Carotta kiln stables, post office, botanical garden, Zabarella building, Roccabonella building, new conference centre).

A number of European projects have been concluded in recent years involving the University of Padova, including:

GEO4CIVHIC $^{29}$ , whose aim is to develop and demonstrate the most efficient and easy-to-install shallow geothermal technologies, using innovative and compact drilling machines suitable for the built environment, and developing or adapting heat pumps and other hybrid

solutions in combination with RESs for retrofitting and for the heating and cooling of existing and historic buildings,

CHeaP GSHP³⁰, which aims to reduce the cost of ownership, investment and operation of shallow geothermal plants, increase safety during installation and operation, and increase knowledge of this technology. The project involves the improvement of an existing innovative vertical hole installation technology and the design and development of new installation methods. As part of CHeaP GSHP, a pilot project is being implemented to evaluate efficient geothermal solutions thanks to the technical-scientific contribution of the CNR, in the industrial area of Padova. In addition, a partnership with the RFX Consortium for heat exchange and integration of energy from geothermal plants in the absence of exchangeable energy between utilities is being finalised.

As a further experiment, thanks to the identification of regional funds, the construction of a connection well between a residential area in Padova and the thermal area south of the city (municipality of Montegrotto Terme) is being evaluated, to exploit the area's high volcanic heat potential.

In total, the strategy envisages the connection of 12,500 residential dwellings (12.5% of the dwellings surveyed in Padova), about 315 buildings for tertiary use (15% of the city's tertiary buildings) and about 200 industrial buildings (20% of the total), for a total development of about 140 km. Projects for the construction of new networks or the extension of existing district heating networks will focus on so-called efficient district heating, i.e. district heating based on the distribution of heat generated from renewable sources, waste heat or produced in high-efficiency cogeneration plants.

## 4. SMART Project - Padova's city-wide tram network system

The SMART project (Padova's city-wide tram network system) included in the portfolio (Table B-2.2a) represents a new way to reach any terminus without changes and to connect the main strategic points of the city (hospitals, new police station, city centre, university buildings, court, railway station and suburban service station), ensuring better circulation and more efficient and sustainable mobility.

The new system involves the use of 55 vehicles, which can make up to 450 trips per day and will allow up to 12,000 people per hour to be moved. The city will have eight transport lines, identified by as many colours:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure B.1 - Sistema Metropolitano a Rete Tramviaria (Padova's city-wide tram network system)

The construction of the SMART project requires the completion of the new tram infrastructure financed by the NRRP (SIR2 from Vigonza to Rubano for a total length of  $17.5\mathrm{km}$  and SIR3 from the railway station to Voltabarozzo for a length of  $5.4\mathrm{km}$ ) and the integration with the modal interchange systems on the outskirts of the city, to encourage a reduction in entries in the city. The measure is already fully financed and in the construction phase. The work will be completed by 2026 and the SMART system will be fully operational from 2027.

In order to facilitate the total coverage of the electricity consumption of the new tram lines, photovoltaic canopies are to be built in the park-and-ride car parks at the edge of the city, with the aim of ensuring both the shading of the parking spaces and the reduction of the heat island.

The estimated emission contribution from this action is derived from an assessment of the reduction in the number of private vehicles circulating by 2030 due to the development of the tram network. It is estimated that approximately 210 million kilometres travelled by endothermic vehicles can be avoided.

# 5. Solar panels on civil and industrial buildings and activation of energy communities

In addition to the measures already included in the portfolio (Tables B-2.2), this strategic action aims to accelerate the rate of installation of new solar photovoltaic renewable energy power plants. The availability of large roof areas of both civil and industrial buildings, the presence of public and private actors willing to share the energy produced through the establishment of joint renewable energy communities and the favourable conditions of the photovoltaic market (falling prices, increasingly efficient storage systems, etc.) should favour a massive and widespread installation of photovoltaic systems. As a confirmation of these intentions, in 2023, thanks to the promotion by the Municipality, a manifesto for the development of “Padova 2030” RECs³¹ was signed by local stakeholders: among them University of Padova, Chamber of Commerce, Confindustria Veneto Est, Confapi Padova, Coldiretti Padova, Asvess, CsvSV of Padova and Rovigo, Upa-Confartigianato, Oipe-Osservatorio Italiano sulla Poverty Energetica, Confagricoltura, Ascom and the Diocese of Padova.

The strategy is based on assessments of photovoltaic potential developed by the Google Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE). This tool provides an estimate of the technical solar potential of all buildings in the city. Knowledge about the shape of buildings is calculated using a machine learning algorithm that exploits data from Google Maps and aerial images. According to EIE estimates, in the municipality of Padova there is a maximum potential of about 730 MW (excluding north-facing roofs), while the installed photovoltaic power measured in 2021 was only 55 MW.

Thanks to the favourable conditions mentioned in the introduction, the action considers that about 50% of the maximum potential can be exploited by 2030 due to the installation of photovoltaic systems, in all adding a capacity of about 310 MW to the level recorded in 2021 (without taking into account the new installed capacity envisaged in the SECAP, amounting to a further 16.5 MW).

According to the Renewable Municipalities Report³² compiled by Legambiente, In 2023 the Padova area ranked second in Italy for the number of new installations, reaching approximately 15 MW in a single year.

Among other things, achieving this goal involves identifying and overcoming barriers for installations in the city centre. The recent amendments to the Building Regulations of Padova (approved by Municipal Council resolution 38/2024) go in this direction. Article 89 of these regulations envisages a distinction between the area of the city centre recognised by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage Site, with particularly stringent constraints for the installation of photovoltaic and solar thermal panels, and the rest of the city centre, where the possibilities for intervention have been broadened compared to the past.

With regard to the plants to be installed in the industrial area of Padova, a careful analysis of the available areas and an assessment of the possible sharing of space with intensive green roofs will be carried out in order to reduce the contribution of large photovoltaic plants to the formation of potential heat islands. For the industrial area, a study of available roofs has already been prepared with the aid of a drone, through which a photovoltaic potential of around 150 MW was assessed.

The strategy therefore envisages:

communication and information campaigns to make end-users aware of the effectiveness of the measure and the favourable cost-benefit ratio of photovoltaics (currently the break-even point is around 5-6 years), also exploiting specially designed financial products made available by local banking operators or possible alternative solutions such as operational leasing,
the activation of energy communities in the municipality, stimulating energy sharing among community users, maximising self-consumption. This action also has a social purpose, as it

provides for the redistribution of the economic benefits from the incentives provided by the GSE, for the benefit of households and people living in energy poverty,

the revamping of existing plants (with new installed power  $40\%$  higher than previous conditions) that have reached the end of their lifespan have already been depreciated in terms of initial investment cost or have been damaged by extreme weather events (e.g. hail).

Padova Council approved its "Guidelines for the promotion and implementation of PADOVA 2030 renewable and socially responsible energy communities with Council resolution no. 2023/0087 dated 7 March 2023. As part of the manifesto for the development of RECs mentioned above, the municipality is promoting co-planning with the other public actors in the area, with the aim of arriving at the identification of the legal form and the preparation of the articles of association of a new REC with public governance. Activities preparatory to the launch of the REC are being carried out within the Let's GOv project, $^{33}$  funded by the NetZeroCities programme.

The creation of new private energy communities gravitating around a number of city sports centres is envisaged through the development of the RES Padova pilot project, financed by the EUCF programme and currently in the Investment Concept definition phase, involving members/customers both in the collection of the financial resources necessary for the installation of the systems (crowdfunding) and in the use of the energy produced, both locally (through free recharging of electric vehicles) and at home (through membership in the energy community). The model can be replicated in other similar contexts where user communities have already been established (e.g. supermarket customers, etc.).

This measure is consistent with the contents of the new Case Green Directive, which for existing public and non-residential buildings envisages the gradual installation of solar energy starting in 2027 where this is technically, economically and functionally feasible, with specific photovoltaic targets for public buildings with a useful floor area over  $250\mathrm{m}^2$  (by the end of 2030) and for non-residential buildings with a useful floor area over  $500\mathrm{m}^2$  subject to authorisation for major projects (by the end of 2027).

# 6. Boiler replacement in civil and industrial buildings

In addition to the measures already listed in the portfolio (Tables B-2.2), this strategic action includes:

https://netzerocities.eu/italys-pilot-activity-letsgov-governing-the-transition-through-pilot-actions/
COMUNE di PADOVA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

the launch of new tenders for the gradual replacement of old boilers/heat generators with the installation of electric heat pumps in residential buildings,
technical-economic support to the public and businesses through a dedicated information desk for tertiary and industrial buildings (Padova Energy Help Desk, $^{34}$  available since 2021).

The tenders may be geared to the benefit of end users who:

already have facilities in good condition, in order to avoid financing plants that are oversized compared to potential future needs,
already have, as a priority but not exclusively, electricity generation systems from renewable sources (e.g. photovoltaics) capable of powering (at least partially) the heat pump,
are in recognised energy poverty conditions (with the possibility of co-financing the installation at a higher percentage than in other cases).

The action requires that at least  $15\%$  of residential housing,  $15\%$  of tertiary buildings and  $15\%$  of industrial buildings replace their thermal generation systems by 2030.

This measure complies with the contents of the Case Green Directive, which envisages the phasing out of boilers powered by fossil fuels, inviting Member States to formulate specific measures to facilitate this transition in the heating and cooling sector, with the ultimate goal of completely eliminating boilers powered by such fuels by 2040. Furthermore, subsidies for the installation of autonomous boilers running on fossil fuels are to be discontinued from January 2025.

The measure is already partially supported by the Veneto Region, which annually publishes a call for tenders ("Bando Stufe"35) to encourage Veneto residents to contribute to the technological modernisation of heat generators through the replacement of biomass or diesel heating systems with new biomass or heat pump systems throughout the region.

The measure is also incentivised through the "Conto Termico" scheme $^{36}$  managed by the GSE, which provides incentives for private individuals for the installation of heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, solar thermal systems and heat pump hybrid systems.

In addition to the measures already included in the portfolio (Tables B-2.2), this strategic action focuses on the implementation of mobility management policies through local companies and schools with mobility managers. The action also concerns Padova Municipality employees, students and employees of the University of Padova and those in the city's population who are unemployed

or require forms of support for the use of public or private shared city mobility services. The action estimates that about 30,000 people could be involved in mobility management actions in Padova, which could allow a  $20\%$  reduction in the number of kilometres travelled annually by private vehicles, identifying alternative forms of mobility to individual travel, either through the use of LPT vehicles or through the promotion of cycling or other solutions such as car pooling or shared mobility.

These measures are often already included in the Commuting Plans of public and private companies in the area. Many Climate Agreements were stipulated with parties that have the capacity and strength to directly influence the promotion of mobility management: from the trade associations of the tertiary and manufacturing world (Confindustria Veneto Est, CNA, ASCOM, APPE), which can offer consultancy services or training and communications, to major companies in the area, which have mobility managers and can directly implement sustainable mobility actions (University of Padova, ARPAV, AcegasApsAmga, Peroni, etc.).

The promotion of MaaS requires the full integration of the various mobility systems offering alternatives to cars, both technological and in terms of rates, and the identification of specific forms of rewards. With this in mind, the University of Padova signed a memorandum of understanding with Padova Municipality and is working on the topic of MaaS as part of Spoke 8 "MaaS &amp; Innovative services",[37] supporting the municipal administration in the identification and implementation of pilot projects. The Municipality will also rely on the MaaS for Italy national platform, which offers services to public bodies for the performance of feasibility studies.

In order to encourage the use of collective transport and reduce private mobility to access the city, the possibility of offering free parking at park-and-ride car parks and the application of a reduced rate for the use of LPT for the entire day will be evaluated. This policy will have to be coordinated with the activation of the LEZ, in order to guarantee a viable alternative for owners of vehicles subject to the restrictions.

As part of the Integrated Sustainable Urban Development Strategy $^{38}$  the implementation of infomobility systems and the development of already existing systems is planned, necessary for the launch of a regional MaaS system and integrations with national MaaS integration platforms (MIMS), as well as the development of a regional single ticket solution.

# 8. LPT electric buses

In addition to the measures already included in the portfolio (Table B-2.2a), this strategic action envisages a further gradual replacement of residual diesel buses in local public transport with new electric vehicles powered by renewable energy sources. The policy of fleet electrification will be carried out at the same time as the progressive reduction of the fleet due to the expansion of the new tram lines. In the long term, therefore, the percentage of electric vehicles out of the total number of vehicles circulating on urban lines will rise to 65%, although this fraction is calculated net of a reduction in the overall number of road vehicles, due to the introduction of the new tramway lines on rail.

The replacement of about one-third of the fleet that is still diesel-fuelled has already been planned thanks to the 2021-2027 NRRP and ERDF funding.

The new vehicles will be used to support the three tram lines SIR1, SIR 2 and SIR3. Electric buses will have priority use on the existing U03, U06, U07, U10, U25 lines in urban and suburban areas.

The action also includes the construction of a charging station for electric buses at the Busitalia Veneto depot in Via del Pescarotto. The investment project will include civil and plant engineering works, as well as the supply and installation of all the electrical infrastructure (including equipment) necessary for the construction of an overnight recharging facility inside the depot, where up to 12 fully electrically powered buses will be stationed. The charging facility will be compatible with any make and model of electric bus. This compatibility will allow not only the powering of vehicle traction batteries but also, through communication protocols between vehicles and station, the optimised and intelligent management of recharging through dedicated software (SMART CHARGING).

In order to encourage the use of public transport by road, 366 new electronic signs will be installed at bus stops, giving city users quick access to information on arrival times. Special on-board ticket payment devices will also be installed, which will further facilitate the use of the service.

# 9. Introduction of a Low Emission Zone

With regard to access regulation, the measures proposed by the SUMP already include the revision of the current structure of the restricted traffic zone (and pedestrian zone) in the city of Padova and the introduction of the Low Emission Zone, as an action capable of correlating access rules according to vehicle type. The required change involves the need for a more expansive view of access to the city that brings the environmental load of vehicles (vehicle size, fuel type and emission standards) more directly into play.

The action envisages therefore the introduction of a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) in the city of Padova capable of progressively limiting the circulation of the most polluting vehicles. It is a measure justified in Padova by the constraints on vehicle traffic envisaged in the Po Valley Basin Programme
COMUNE di PADOVA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Agreement. The agreement requires the implementation of traffic restriction measures when the PM10 concentration limits are exceeded in urban and metropolitan areas. Through the LEZ these limitations would be extended temporally.

The Climate City Contract does not simply act by introducing new and more stringent restrictions, but offers mobility alternatives that guarantee high levels of accessibility of urban places. Significant investments in the expansion of the network and collective transport offer, the construction of new park-and-ride facilities and the expansion of the bicycle network and associated services are therefore elements that reinforce this strategy. The introduction of the LEZ will affect the area inside the ring roads. The implementation of the measure will require the introduction of increasingly binding controls according to a predefined time scale.

The activation of this measure is subject to an analysis of the demand and supply of mobility and will be developed in connection with the implementation of the previously mentioned alternative solutions such as the tram line, the "bicipolitana" and park-and-ride facilities. The introduction of the LEZ will also be based on the results of the ReVeAL project $^{39}$ . A further tool available to reduce accesses in the city, which can possibly be integrated with the new LEZ in Padova, is the innovative ordinances of the Move-In project (MOnitoraggio VEicoli INquinanti [Monitoring of Polluting Vehicles] $^{40}$ ), active in the Veneto Region in the areas of the participating municipalities, including Padova since February 2024. The project is an alternative measure to the structural restrictions on the circulation of the most polluting vehicles imposed for air quality, through a more conscious use of the vehicle, taking into account actual use and the driving style adopted. By voluntarily joining Move-In, the vehicle is no longer subject to the prescribed hourly and daily blocks, but receives an annual mileage allocation based on environmental type and class. Additional bonus kilometres are also awarded following the detection of a more sustainable driving style in urban areas and on motorways (by means of a black box). Once the mileage threshold is reached the vehicle can no longer be used in the service area until the completion of the year of membership.

Thanks to the introduction of the LEZ, it is estimated that around  $25\%$  of annual trips into the city can be avoided, with a reduction of 125 million/km travelled by vehicles with low environmental performance.

## Planned actions

Completion of a feasibility study for the introduction of the LEZ in Padova (2025)
Monitoring of the effectiveness of the Move-In Project (2025)

## 10. Actions to promote cycling

Already included in the portfolio (Table B-2.2a), the action envisages the full implementation of the Padova Bicipolitana and the promotion of cycling, including through the installation of bike racks and bike boxes.

Among the main projects planned and already in the implementation or future construction phase are:

continuation of San Bellino cycleway,
the construction of cycling routes that will connect the station with the main university hubs, such as the areas of Via Dolfin, Via Grassi/Rocco/Ippodromo and the connection of existing cycling routes,
the Bicipolitana north wall,
the Bicipolitana west wall,
the Bicipolitana Chiesanuova,
the Bicipolitana hills,
the Bicipolitana south wall,
the Bicipolitana south-eastern wall,
the Bicipolitana 12A Facciolati,
the redevelopment of Via  $58^{\circ}$  Fanteria,
the Mandria cycleway.

Through this action to strengthen the bicycle network in the City of Padova, it is expected that the number of kilometres cycled annually could increase by about  $35\%$ , or about 20 million km/year. These new routes are considered as alternatives to the use of the private car.

# 11. Promotion of the purchase of certified electricity

In addition to the measures already included in the portfolio (Tables B-2.2), this strategic action is expected to significantly and progressively increase the number of end users (residents, public and private companies, associations, etc.) who will sign electricity supply contracts with a guarantee of origin from certified renewable sources. This measure is based on a dual assumption: on the one hand, there will be a gradual electrification of final energy consumption (in transport, civil and industrial buildings), and on the other hand it will not be possible to meet the entire demand through on-site production of energy from renewable sources. Many stakeholders have already started to procure green energy, as described in the SECAP actions. These include: the city of Padova, the University of Padova, AcegasApsAmga, ARPAV, Coldiretti, the Diocese of Padova, etc. In addition, some companies in the area have included the purchase of certified electricity among their Climate City Contract actions.

A first overall mapping of the state of the art regarding the share of green energy purchased in the area will be carried out in 2025, through a questionnaire involving suppliers operating in Padova. Drawing on the results of this survey, a number of communication campaigns will be structured, organised and implemented in order to inform the public and local organisations and associations of the importance of this specific measure in contributing to the achievement of climate neutrality.

It is assumed that by 2030 about  $60\%$  of the electricity consumed in Padova will be purchased from certified green sources, without taking into account the additional contributions from the actions already accounted for in the SECAP, which provide for the further purchase of 18 MWh from

## 12. Communication/information to the public and businesses

In addition to the measures already included in the portfolio (Tables B-2.2), a massive, multi-year, multi-channel communication campaign will be implemented through this strategic action. Many of the actions that can be taken with respect to climate neutrality can be implemented directly by the public, businesses and other organisations and associations in the area, through the purchase of green technologies or the adoption of practices to reduce energy consumption. The maturity already achieved by some technologies, such as photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, insulation materials, etc., will allow their rapid deployment, also thanks to their favourable cost-benefit ratio. The financial solutions available to end users today, which will be further extended by operators in the province of Padova (see Climate Agreements), and the opportunities offered by tax deductions, will allow for a rapid spread of these devices. Moreover, the potential for reducing consumption from wasted energy in the civil, industrial and transport sectors is widely recognised. Waste reduction can come from increased end-user awareness and through the adoption of smart metering and energy management solutions for tertiary and industrial users.

The action envisages that 15% of electricity consumption and 10% of thermal consumption in the civil and industrial sectors and 15% of transport consumption (considering only diesel and petrol vehicles) can be reduced by means of information and communication actions, which on the one hand can lead to the dissemination of green technologies, and on the other to the reduction of waste and the optimisation of end uses.

The action also envisages that approximately one-fourth of the expected reduction in emissions associated with waste production and incineration can be ensured through targeted user-oriented communication actions, as a result of improved sorting of the waste produced.

Communication and information actions can be considered cross-cutting with respect to the other strategic actions. Every change introduced in city life (e.g. activation of the LEZ) and every new opportunity that exists (e.g. provision of new resources for the purchase of climate-neutral devices such as heat pumps, photovoltaic systems, electric vehicles, etc.) will have to be accompanied by relevant communication campaigns.

The strategic action includes the activation and maintenance of a communication campaign capable of reaching the entire municipal population (from the youngest – with activities in schools – to the oldest) and all the city's stakeholders in a widespread manner. The campaign should be designed using different channels and media, both digital and non-digital (social networks, road posters, radio, TV, local newspapers, dedicated events, etc.) and defining a coordinated graphic design to support all information and communication activities (from the posters to the materials to be distributed at public events). The identification of one or more prominent spokespersons will be crucial to engage citizens more extensively and effectively. In addition, a dedicated website will be

set up where all Climate Agreements and project partners will be published and where it will be possible to follow the development of the various measures envisaged to achieve climate neutrality.

## 13. Improvement of waste collection

In addition to the measures already included in the portfolio (Tables B-2.2), the strategic action provides for a progressive improvement in source-separated waste collection in the city, significantly reducing the percentage of non-separated waste and the pro-capita production of dry waste. The objectives assigned to the Basin Council that Padova Municipality belongs to were defined at the regional level with Regional Council Decree no. 988 of 9 August 2022. For the "Padova Centro" council for the Padova catchment area (of which Padova Municipality is a member), the 2030 target is the production of 115 kg/person of residual waste and the achievement of 80% separate waste collection. The strategy for achieving these goals will be defined in the course of 2025, and includes:

the construction of new collection centres (a new facility was financed by the NRRP in Via del Bigolo in Arcella and will be used to collect different categories of recyclable waste such as WEEE, hazardous urban waste such as batteries, motor oils, special waste similar to urban waste, bulky waste),
the construction of pre-treatment plants for recycled waste in Corso Stati Uniti, which will significantly reduce the movement of transport vehicles to the waste treatment plants (taking place directly at the transfer centre) and will reduce material waste to 5% as opposed to the 10% that was traditionally achieved, increasing the efficiency of separate waste collection and therefore increasing revenue for the community from a higher quality of recyclable material. Finally, the earth from the excavations for the construction of the plant will be used to reclaim the land of the former Roncajette landfill, providing a clear example of the application of circular economy principles to eliminate waste,
the definition of differentiated collection policies in the city, taking into account the different urban and morphological characteristics of the spaces available for the optimal provision of the service and taking into account the issues associated with implementation in the city centre,
the provision of a pay-as-you-throw rate to incentivise the progressive reduction of unsorted waste, to be implemented at the same time as a better control of deliveries,
the encouragement of re-use and recycling and of all waste prevention policies.

## B-2.3: Remaining emission reduction strategies

It will be difficult to abate the remaining part of the climate-altering emissions (20% of the baseline emissions of 256,635 tonnes CO2). These emissions can be considered "hard to abate" as they are associated with processes or utilities that are unlikely to be energy efficient or benefit from energy production from renewable electrical (photovoltaic) or thermal (geothermal, solar thermal, etc.) sources.

According to a compensatory logic, part of these emissions can be absorbed by the public and private trees and shrubs in the municipality and in the process of being planted.

## "Hard-to-abate" emissions

The hard-to-abate category mainly includes civil and industrial users that, due to their geographical location (e.g. city centre), type of industrial process (e.g. heavy manufacturing industry), and building characteristics (e.g. listed or valuable buildings) are not among the buildings that will benefit from energy redevelopment by 2030 (or only partially). The civil buildings in Padova's city centre are subject to regulatory and physical-technological constraints that prevent or limit the works that can be carried out. In these cases, for example, many buildings cannot be insulated by means of external cladding or are limited in the possibility of replacing windows and doors, or cannot host photovoltaic systems on the roof or heat pumps that require external units for heat dissipation. Sometimes, when there are innovative technical solutions (e.g. solar tiles), the cost or performance of these technologies make the solution less attractive.

It is estimated that 56% of unabated residual emissions fall under this category.

There will also be some transport-related emissions that cannot be abated by 2030. Some heavy or light road vehicles will continue to run using endothermic diesel or petrol engines, as the market does not yet offer viable solutions for the total electrification of the vehicle fleet. Moreover, many vehicles will not yet have exhausted the multi-year depreciation of their purchase cost and thus cannot be expected to be replaced before that date. In contrast to the civil and industrial construction sector, residual emissions from transport can still be reduced in the longer term. Residual emissions from transport will account for about 24.9% of the total by 2030.

Even with regard to waste management, a block of unabated emissions, i.e. associated with the production of undifferentiated waste delivered to the incinerator in Padova, can be expected to remain. The enormous effort to increase the proportion of differentiated waste and to reduce dry waste per capita described in strategic action no. 13 is in itself extremely ambitious and difficult to implement, because even in this area the introduction of new waste collection solutions may be hindered by spatial and urban planning constraints (e.g. in the city centre, where spaces for door-to-door collection are not always guaranteed or are in any case hindered by lengthy decision-making processes or behavioural obstacles). By 2030, it is estimated that 28,400 tonnes of CO2 will remain, or 10.4% of the total.

Finally, a further block of residual emissions is attributable to methane leaks in the city's gas distribution network. Despite the numerous maintenance operations, given the extent of the network, which covers the entire municipality, and considering the need to sign specific agreements
COMUNE di PADOVA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

with local distributors (the Administration's objective for the coming years), it is cautiously assumed that the network will not see a reduction in leaks by 2030. These emissions will therefore account for 8.6% of total residual emissions.

## "Offsettable" emissions

Approximately 1,505 tonnes of CO2 (0.59% of hard-to-abate emissions) can be offset through absorption by the city's green assets.

In the scenarios developed within the Green Spaces Plan, approved by the municipal administration in 2022 by Council resolution no. 2022/029, some hypotheses of urban green development are shown in a long-term scenario, corresponding to a 20-year time span. Compared to the total number of trees in the municipality (both public and private) in 2021, which is approximately 430,000, the Green Spaces Plan aims to increase this value by 30%. Considering the 2030 target of the Climate City Contract, it is assumed that about 50% of the Plan's target can be achieved, thus envisaging the planting of 65,000 new trees in public and private spaces (of which 30,000 are already included in actions of the SECAP) and achieving a total stock of about 500,000 trees by 2030. The action also aims to bring the existing tree stock towards normal conditions, with appropriate planning and management strategies. Part of this strategy was initiated in 2021-2022 (and accounted for in the SECAP) with the planting of 10,000 trees⁴¹ in public spaces in the city.

The planting of new trees also involves the implementation of de-paving and de-impermeabilisation of some of the city's areas, such as Piazza Savelli, a car park redevelopment project in the Soft City area, financed by the former Ministry for Ecological Transition. This strategy was also included in the Piano degli Interventi, approved by Padova Council in 2023 with resolution no. 6/2023, in which it was assumed that approximately 930,000 square metres would be unsealed and transformed into permeable areas.

The availability of new areas may also derive from the application of urban equalisation, aimed at improving urban, landscape, architectural, energy, hydraulic and environmental quality through the recognition of a building capacity to entities that, by way of example, provide for the implementation of public interest projects, including urban forestation.

A multi-year programme to unseal sealed grounds and start the campaign for planting new trees (continuing until 2030) is planned for 2025.

Offsetting actions related to the planting of trees were planned by some city stakeholders and included in Tables B-2.2.

To conclude this module, following is an overview of the items contributing to the achievement of climate neutrality through an 80% reduction of the baseline (equal to 1,283,174 tCO₂eq) corresponding to 1,026,540 tCO₂eq:

Contribution of the existing Plans (SECAP): 168,017 tCO₂eq per year, equal to 16.37% of the target
Contribution of the Portfolio Actions envisaged by the stakeholders in the area who are signatories to Climate Agreements and included in Tables B-2.2: 133,343 tCO₂eq equal to 13.00% of the target
Contribution of the Behavioural Actions: according to NZC guidelines, potential energy savings due to behavioural measures can range from a minimum of 2% to a maximum of 20%, in accordance with the European Environment Agency. In light of the above, the

behavioural actions in this Plan (net of those already quantified by the stakeholders and included in the portfolio) have been estimated at  $15\%$  of the target, equal to 153,981 tCO $_2$ eq

Contribution of the Strategic Actions: the 13 actions developed by the Administration as frameworks for the portfolio actions and key actions for achieving climate neutrality by 2030: the contribution to the reduction of the baseline is substantial, amounting to  $55.30\%$ , corresponding to 568,179 tCO $_2$ eq

The following chart visually summarises the above: the Gap is almost zero and equal to 3,018 tCO $_2$ eq (0.3% of the target).

"Residual emissions" refers to the remaining  $20\%$  of hard-to-abate emissions (see Section B-2.3), i.e. those emissions that for structural, economic, financial, behavioural, etc. reasons, cannot be abated (amounting to 256,635 tCO $_2$ eq). Residual emissions can be partially abated through offsetting actions, mainly associated with the absorption of CO2 by the city's trees and shrubs (1,505 tonnes of CO2 equal to  $0.59\%$  of residual emissions).

# 7.3. Module B-3 Monitoring, evaluation and improvement indicators

The Municipality of Padova has been publishing an Environmental Report since 2006, a tool that guides the Administration's objectives year by year and assesses its efforts compared to what has already been achieved. In fact, the structure of the document makes it possible to understand whether policies are acting correctly by highlighting potential impacts and benefits and also ensuring monitoring over time thanks to an array of indicators that have been consolidated over the editions of the document.
COMUNE di PADOVA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

The 14th edition of the document, referring to 2022, maintained the same methodology that refers to the European CSRD directive⁴² and the CLEAR method,⁴³ identifying 13 areas that correspond to the major environmental and sustainability issues on which the city has an interest in reporting, each of which contains an important range of indicators that rate the work done.

This tool is a document that is well embedded within the local administrative context as it contains sustainability policies identified from the municipality's main planning documents, involving the respective councillors and executives who operationally draft and manage them.

One of the main objectives of the Environmental Report is to analyse the expenditures incurred in the implementation of the organisation's environmental policies. For this reason it will be extensively covered in Part A of the Investment Plan.

The following table represents a further development of the indicators currently included in the Environmental Report. In fact, they were selected based on the strategic actions identified by Council, confirming the key role these will play in the coming years. The indicators selected make it possible to concisely and effectively assess the implementation status of the planned measures and indirectly the emission impacts they cause.

The objective of climate neutrality has also been included in the section of the Single Programming Document that commits all the companies in which Padova Council has a stake: objective no. 5 "Initiatives aimed at achieving objectives of efficiency, cost-effectiveness of management and reduction of climate-changing emissions in line with the goal of a climate-neutral city and with the objectives of the Climate City Contract, also linked to the containment of increases in energy costs" provides for the drafting of an annual summary report on the activities carried out, with specific monitoring indicators.

The metadata sheets (B-3.2.1 to B-3.2.14) detail the sources and methods of data collection for monitoring, as well as the procedures for assessing the effectiveness of the actions in reducing climate-changing emissions.

⁴² Directive no. 2022/2464 Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) gives guidance on sustainability reporting by extending the objectives of the previous European directive of 2014 to the following areas: the extension of the scope of application to large companies and large groups (including unlisted) as well as to small and medium-sized enterprises; the use of common reporting standards defined at the European level (ESRS); and the obligation to subject reporting to a statement of compliance.

⁴³ The CLEAR method (City and Local Environmental Accounting and Reporting) is an environmental accounting tool developed in Europe to provide operational support to local authorities in the Member States in the area of procedures, models, practices and indicators.

energy from renewable sources that can increase the self-consumption share of the circulating vehicle fleet will also be considered. The increase of electric vehicles on the road is assumed to be proportional to the reduction of internal combustion vehicles. The calculation of emission savings will take into account the energy mix used in the road transport sector (as of 2021 dominated by diesel and petrol).

By defining the number of electric vehicles out of the total registered vehicle fleet, the indicator indirectly measures certain secondary benefits including the reduction of noise pollution and the improvement of air quality in the city.

The indicator is able to fully assess the impact of the strategic action it refers to (strategic action 2).

The monitoring of the installation of electric vehicle charging points will be carried out through the PUN (national database of charging infrastructure).44

This indicator is not included in the Covenant of Mayors platform.

## Data collection requirements

The data will be taken from the statistics compiled annually by ACI as part of its Self-Portrait, which provides details of the registered vehicle fleet broken down by municipality, by Euro category, by type of vehicle and by type of energy vector used.

The source of the data is therefore national but with details per municipality. It is planned to monitor the indicator on an annual basis.

# 8 Part C – Enabling climate neutrality by 2030

Part C "Enabling climate neutrality by 2030" aims to outline any enabling interventions — i.e. regarding organizational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations — designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the opportunities, gaps and barriers identified in Modules A-2 and A-3.

# 8.1. Module C-1 Governance innovation interventions

# Table C-1.1: Governance actions for achieving climate neutrality

# Governance of the carbon neutrality process

The carbon neutrality process is backed by a horizontal and vertical governance model, which revolves around the local government structure and the Council's subsidiaries and feeds off the relations with stakeholders operating in the municipal area (public and private) and with institutions and organizations that operate at a supra-municipal level.

# Horizontal governance

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure C.1 - Horizontal governance model

Padova Council formally established (with Senior Management resolution no. 2022/56/0005 dated 06/04/2022) an interdepartmental task force to carry out the following activities:

coordinating the delivery of actions provided for under the SECAP, in conjunction with any external stakeholders who may need to be engaged,
monitoring the progress of SECAP actions to check that they are on track to meet the 2030 targets, by compiling indicators on a biennial basis,
exploring actions, projects and programmes that are planned or being implemented but have not yet been included in the SECAP,
identifying the Departments' specific training needs to facilitate the sharing of sustainability

goals and operating practice for the SECAP's execution.

The task force is coordinated by the Environment and Land Department and includes Departments who are directly or indirectly responsible for climate change mitigation and adaptation matters (Green Spaces, Public Works, City Planning, Financial Resources, Mobility, Private Building, Social Services, Innovation and Digital Transition - formerly SIT).

The task force is assisted by Senior Management

The task force is expected to meet continuously at regular intervals.

The SECAP provides for the creation of a Resilience Management department. With resolution no. 2023/0718 dated 19/12/2023, Council determined to establish the department following approval of the Climate City Contract by the European Commission, also tasking the department with setting up the Steering Group for the Climate City Contract's implementation, who would be required to interact and liaise with the interdepartmental Task Force and whose team would include contacts from the different Departments of strategic importance for the CCC's implementation. The duties tasked to the Steering Group include:

implementing the Climate City Contract and liaising with the Mission City Advisor,
taking part in initiatives organized by NetZeroCities,
identifying initiatives, trials and projects developed by other cities or strategic partners to be replicated in Padova,
coming up with, preparing and planning new submissions to European funding programmes, developing relations with public and private partners,
processing the data collected through the Interdepartmental Task Force in order to compile a biennial report on the progress of the SECAP and Climate City Contract,
organizing and taking part in communication and information activities,
organizing and taking part in meetings and information sharing and exchange sessions with local stakeholders.

The technical team is supported by the political structure, made up of the Mayor, the Councillor for the Environment acting in concert with the Councillors responsible for related areas, and a council member who has delegated authority for climate neutrality matters. The political structure sets out the vision for the city's development and strategic objectives, which must also result from the broad participation of all local stakeholders and citizens.

Council is assisted by its subsidiaries, which have signed specific climate agreements with the local government:

AcegasApsAmga, which is a utility company providing services such as water resource management and distribution, electricity generation and execution of energy efficiency improvement work, waste collection and treatment, along with many other services: public lighting, district heating, facility management, integrated urban water management, etc.,
Busitalia Veneto S.p.A., which provides urban and suburban public transport services across the districts of Padova and Rovigo,
Consiglio di Bacino Padova Centro, which is involved in the programming, organization, contracting and control of the public integrated municipal waste management service,
Interporto Padova S.p.A., an intermodal logistics centre that designs and produces logistics and transport infrastructure and services and, through City Porto, handles the urban distribution of goods. As of April 2024, Interporto Padova S.p.A. has also incorporated Padova's industrial area, Consorzio ZIP.

(public and private), who have been involved in the strategic planning process since the inception of the first Agenda 21 group, currently reconfigured into a Living Lab. Some stakeholders who are members of the Living Lab have gone on to sign a Climate Agreement with Padova Council. Others will be asked to do so in the coming years. The underlying philosophy of the Living Lab (including Padova's) is open and voluntary participation.

The Living Lab, which was established as part of the European H2020 2ISECAP project $^{46}$ , in which Padova Council is a partner, integrates innovation and research processes in a partnership between public and private stakeholders in the local context. The creation of the Living Lab fosters capacity-building activities, the exchange of knowledge and active collaboration, to co-define some of the SECAP and Climate City Contract measures.

To define the climate neutrality strategy, the City of Padova organized a campaign to involve local stakeholders, who were actively involved in defining the goals and actions from the earliest stages of the application.

A participatory pathway was organized in spring 2023, in which more than 30 local stakeholders took part and were called to explore three strategic thematic areas for climate neutrality: building stock recovery and RES, sustainable mobility, and circular economy and waste management. The participatory journey was divided into seven meetings, and ended with a public event open to the entire citizenry.

After an initial, more theoretical meeting during which information on Padova 2030 and the Net Zero Cities Mission was provided, the participants, divided into two groups and guided by special facilitators, were asked to identify the main barriers and opportunities related to the three thematic areas covered by the meetings. In a second step, stakeholders were asked to indicate how they could contribute to reducing Padova's carbon footprint by 2030. These first meetings were the basis for the collection of the so-called "Climate Agreements," a document that brings together the actions and commitments of all of the adhering stakeholders: these actions will cover the entire time frame of interest of the Climate City Contract, from the base year 2021 until 2030, with the prospect of monitoring actions cadenced every two years.

Figure C.2 - The meetings with local stakeholders

The participatory path, however, was only the first step in a long journey of local involvement, which subsequently included:

three meetings with the Neighborhood Councils to involve them in the NZC Mission and promote their role as intermediaries to citizens regarding the Padova 2030 pathway. The Neighborhood Councils are the tool developed by the Administration to enable citizens to actively participate in the life and choices that affect individual neighborhoods, in the management of common goods, and in the social and cultural life of the places where people live and work. The members of the Councils, in fact, on the one hand are spokespersons for the needs of the area of reference, and on the other, thanks to the participatory budgeting tool made available to them each year, they promote activities and projects that they consider a priority in their neighborhood. During the meetings held in the fall of 2023, the members of the councils proposed to use part of the budget made available to them annually for environmental works, from 2025 and up to 2030, actively contributing to the Climate Neutrality Mission, as well as serving as an information point to the citizenry;

4 public meetings (May 2023, November 2023, December 2023, April 2024) open to the entire citizenry. These meetings were embedded within widely attended city festivals (National Energy and Sustainability Forum 2023 and 2024, Sustainability and Culture Festival 2023, Compraverde Forum 2023), so as to have a good sounding board. During these meetings, the Climate Neutrality Mission was told and explained and what the City of Padova intends to accomplish in the coming years. Stakeholder engagement was also given visibility, indicating the collective effort the city is putting forth and the need to address the Climate Neutrality Mission with a holistic and synergistic approach;
ongoing bilateral technical and policy meetings in the period between September 2023 and June 2024 to engage the territory in the CCC drafting process and give it concreteness within the Climate Agreements;
educational activities at schools in Padova. Every year the City of Padova promotes educational activities at city schools of all levels (from kindergarten to high school) on environment-related topics. Starting in 2023, it has been decided to prioritize the issue of climate change, declined in different forms, offering schools courses on energy and renewable sources, conscious behavior and consumption choices, sustainable mobility and biodiversity protection. The municipality's intent is to contribute to raising awareness among young people, so as to give them the tools to become aware and responsible adults. These educational activities are in addition to other historical initiatives of the City of Padova, such as the "Green Miles" competition, which awards prizes to elementary school classes in which boys and girls walk or bike the most miles on the home-school route.

As part of the activities focused around collaboration and co-designing of Climate City Contract measures, Padova Council has signed a number of important collaborative agreements with local actors:

on 16 January 2023, the "Padova 2030" Manifesto of Renewable (and socially responsible) Energy Communities was signed, with many local stakeholders joining the initiative, including ASCOM (Padova's traders association), ASVESS (Veneto sustainable development association), Padova Chamber of Commerce, CSV di Padova e Rovigo (voluntary services centre - Padova and Rovigo branch), Coldiretti Padova (national farmers' federation - Padova branch), Confagricoltura Padova (Italian farmers' confederation - Padova branch), Confapi Padova (federation of small businesses - Padova

branch), Confartigianato Padova (artisan business association - Padova branch), Confindustria Veneto Est (confederation of Italian industry - East Veneto branch), Padova Diocese, OIPE (Italian energy poverty observatory) and the University of Padova,

on 9 March 2023, following the signing of the above-mentioned Manifesto, the "PADOVA 2030" REC Technical Board was established,
on 11 July 2023, the Memorandum of Understanding between the University of Padova and Padova Council was signed for the creation of the Climate City Contract and associated activities (City Council resolution no. 2023/0255 dated 23/05/2023), bringing the benefits of cross-cutting collaboration and exchange of knowledge and skills,
in 2022, the Council of Innovation was formed, a permanent roundtable on innovation representing public and private stakeholders and academia, including Padova City Council, the University of Padova, the Chamber of Commerce, UniSMART (Padova University's foundation to promote technology transfer), Padova Hall Spa, SMACT Competence Center, Confindustria Veneto Est (confederation of Italian industry - East Veneto branch), Le Village by CA Triveneto, Galileo Visionary District, Paradigma, Accenture and non-profit foundation Fondazione Fenice,
in February 2024, Padova City Council and WindTre signed a memorandum of understanding, with the purpose of forming a working group to assess the feasibility of developing and implementing activities/initiatives of public interest in the following fields: Smart City, Institutional Events, Education, Local Innovation Hubs. One of the activities put forward by WindTre as part of the memorandum of understanding was the "Smart City Transformation Academy", a digital education initiative targeted at local government bodies that tackles issues linked to the use of digital technologies to improve the environment and quality of life in cities,
in April 2024, Padova City Council and electricity distributor ENEL Distribuzione signed a memorandum of understanding, as part of the NRRP, to join forces in planning maintenance work on the city's electricity grid and boost its capacity in light of the introduction of the two new tram lines. More specifically, E-Distribuzione has a significant programme of NRRP-related work planned for Padova from 2023 to 2026, for a total of around 66 million euros. This work focuses on upgrading and modernizing the city's electricity grid, which will optimize the service offered to residents, enable end-use electrification and help digitalize the services in question. Overall, the work involves building two new primary substations; the technological upgrading of 168 secondary substations — essential nodal points on the power grid — which will thus be enabled to deliver more power to customers (said systems will also be improved with the addition of the best technologies currently available, so as to encourage end-use electrification by raising the quality of the service offered significantly); and over 120 km of medium- and low-voltage lines to be built new or have their capacity boosted to increase the network's resilience and make more power available to residents.

Climate Agreements are a key part of the Climate City Contract and are signed by Council and by local entities who are prepared to make tangible commitments to reduce GHG emissions in the city. The agreements feature a description of the identified action, the forecast emissions reduction and the financial commitment required for its implementation. Below is a list of the current signatories:

AcegasApsAmga (a company controlled and coordinated by Hera S.p.A., a utility providing waste and water services, gas and electricity distribution in Italy's Northeast, as well as public lighting and energy upgrading nationwide across Italy),

The municipal administration assessed the level of involvement of external stakeholders as being consistent with the city's commitment and gradual objectives of the ongoing ecological transition and the Climate City Contract itself. It is clear that the next few years will bring a broadening of the range of actors involved with a view to increasing public-private engagement. Stakeholders that the administration has failed to engage at this point but which it aims to involve in subsequent editions of the document include: Veneto Region as part of the strengthening of political-regulatory relations, Telecom, NS3 and Nehos for their respective data centres, Safilo as a leading Italian company in the production and distribution of eyeglasses, sunglasses and sports glasses, Coldiretti as an association that brings together local agricultural producers, APS Holding, a company engaged in the management of car parks, the car sharing services, advertising and billposting, ATER, as Azienda Territoriale Edilizia Residenziale of the Province of Padova and finally ULSS 6 Euganea as the local health authority.

To give continuity to the Living Lab launched in 2023, six thematic tables with local stakeholders will be established (or confirmed if already existing), so as to work with continuous and synergistic action on the central themes of decarbonization. These tables cover: renewable energy communities (RECs), housing, industry, innovation hub, sustainable mobility, and food policies (with an eye on scope 3 emissions). The financial and communication-related parts will cut across all Living Lab tables, as both are necessary to ensure that the ideas and projects that emerge are implemented and well communicated.

Several units within the municipality, selected from the SECAP/CCC working group members based on the issues addressed, will be involved in the management of the thematic groups, while the Climate Resilience Manager, as described above, will be responsible for overall coordination. It is also planned to activate a web portal in which each Living Lab member stakeholder will be able to highlight their own project ideas and indicate which partners they need and what resources (human, economic-financial, logistical, etc.) are needed to implement them. This modus operandi represents an important opportunity for the entire city ecosystem to adopt a collaborative, multilevel approach, fostering communication and strategic partnerships.

Padova Council has formed a number of collaborations with neighbouring municipalities, as part of the process of drawing up intermunicipal plans or sustainable urban development programmes:

collaborations formed with the purpose of drawing up the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), dealing with the 18 local governments within Padova's intermunicipal area as defined in the Co.Me.Pa. agreement,
collaborations formed with the purpose of drawing up and implementing the Integrated Sustainable Urban Development Strategy (SISUS), which is part of the Veneto region's ERDF Regional Programme 2021/2027 for the urban area of Padova, for which Padova is the lead authority and which has been set up together with the local governments of Abano Terme, Albignasego, Maserà di Padova, Noventa Padovana, Ponte San Nicolò, Rubano, Selvazzano Dentro and Vigonza,
collaborations with local governments that fall within the waste catchment area of Consorzio di Bacino Padova Centro (Abano Terme, Albignasego, Casalserugo, Ponte San Nicolò and Padova), formed with the purpose of organizing and programming the integrated municipal waste management service.

An important collaboration has also been established with the Province of Padova (as attested by the signing of a Climate Agreement) relating to the formation of a fully publicly controlled REC in the Municipality of Padova. In 2024, the District Council also published a Technical Handbook for renewable energy generation plants. This tool, compiled with due regard for current standards and best practices, is intended as a valuable planning aid for local councils across the Padova area, offering guidelines and specific instructions for the installation of photovoltaic, solar hot water and geothermal systems on residential buildings and manufacturing facilities. Targeted at professionals, citizens and, above all, local governments, the document is offered as a guide to drawing up or implementing Local Building Regulations. There is also a special focus on balancing the intense development of these systems and respect for cultural identities and the shape of the cityscape, with the goal of improving the buildings' energy performance without compromising their architectural quality.

Many synergies have also been established with the Veneto Regional Council around the Covenant of Mayors. Padova Council was selected by ENEA (Italian national agency for new technologies, energy and sustainable economic development) as a case study as part of an information and training programme to help other local councils in the region join and implement the Covenant of Mayors programme. Furthermore, because Padova Council is the only local government body in the region to have been selected as part of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, it is committed to promoting the Mission, sharing the methodology adopted and the outcomes achieved with the other provincial capitals, sharing the experience it gains through training and operational support activities.

At a national level, in September 2022, the City of Padova signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the other eight Italian Mission Cities and the Ministry for Infrastructure and Sustainable Mobility, with the purpose of putting forward solutions, promoting cooperation and developing specific projects, identifying any additional resources to be earmarked to fund the Mission's goals, gathering and sharing best practices, and lastly, collaborating on additional projects to be carried out within the geographical boundaries of the nine Cities. A Coordination Committee and a Technical Board were also established as a result of this memorandum to pursue the Mission's goals in Italy.

Padova Council has partnered with the Mission's other eight Italian Cities to submit the Let's GOv project $^{47}$ as part of the Horizon 2020 research programme with the aim of fostering the development of new governance models towards forms based on a systemic approach that are effective in reconnecting the various actions (either under way or planned) and coordinating visions, stakeholders, processes and projects so that they are all focused on the common goal of climate neutrality (mission-driven model).

The project seeks to:
identify the general governance barriers surrounding the issue of climate neutrality;
identify innovative solutions that will have direct and indirect impacts on the city;
address problems that are common to all the Italian Mission Cities (acquiring and managing data, innovative finance, stakeholder engagement), providing, by the end of the project, a series of ready-to-go solutions that can be replicated in other cities, as well as a possible extension of forms of cross-cutting collaboration and mentoring.

In addition, Padova Council is a partner in the National Coordination of Local Agenda 21 initiatives, a network of local bodies that share experiences related to sustainability, the Smart City and green economy.

## Table C-2.2: Social innovations for achieving climate neutrality

### Innovations for achieving climate neutrality

The key to achieving climate neutrality also lies in greater engagement of the whole population, not just permanent residents but so-called city users and temporary residents, too (e.g. university students). The policies and actions proposed by the Climate City Contract must take into account the socioeconomic and cultural diversity of Padova's population, including in spatial terms. Many of the proposed measures will depend on producing in-depth fact-finding investigations, carried out in collaboration with the Department of Philosophy, Sociology, Education and Applied Psychology of the University of Padova (FISPPA). Some early assessments of public buy-in to renewables have already been carried out, focusing above all on Renewable Energy Communities in order to highlight what factors encourage or stand in the way of citizens' participation in an REC (Menegatto, Bobbio e Zamperini 2023) and the energy upgrading of privately owned buildings.

Additional analyses, which may also involve putting out questionnaires, will need to be devised around achieving the following specific objectives:

conducting an in-depth analysis of the various segments of the population (permanent residents and other people living in the City of Padova), such as university students who live here but are not permanent residents, commuting workers, residents of different ethnicities, vulnerable residents such as the elderly or disabled, vulnerable families, to also include a spatial breakdown based on the characteristics of the various places (points of interest, neighbourhoods, etc.);
developing urban psychosocial, financial and energy poverty indicators;
monitoring indicators so that there is a fair energy transition that results in a psychosocial transition from energy hardship to energy wealth with positive effects on individual, collective and environmental health and wellbeing.

The outcomes will be the first instruments supporting decisions made to steer the local government's future actions. The in-depth analysis findings will allow us to map the urban population according to different characteristics to understand the strengths or, conversely, critical issues hindering active citizen engagement in the implementation of climate neutrality policies.

### Specific investigations will also target:

the university population, which now accounts for roughly a third of Padova's non-permanent population,
businesses and workers in Padova's industrial area, which is one of the most nationally and internationally significant (for Europe) industrial hubs.

Additional social innovations aimed at getting citizens actively involved in the carbon neutrality mission will be devised and set out based on the findings of the fact-finding investigations. These actions will include:

carbon neutrality mediators/facilitators, namely new roles — filled by professionals or other individuals — with the power to stimulate and facilitate the transition processes under way within their respective communities. The people in these roles will be trained by the University of Padova and may fall into three categories:

neighbourhood facilitators, who steer other citizens/residents towards good behaviour or towards making choices in line with the climate neutrality goals,
school facilitators, with the power to engage other students and teachers (across all categories and levels) in adopting sustainable practices and actions within the school environment and at home,
business facilitators, with the power to educate colleagues and managers on adopting organizational measures designed to increase the use of sustainable mobility options and aimed at reducing energy consumption and the generation of waste, etc.

People in the carbon neutrality facilitator/mediator roles will work in synergy with mobility managers and energy managers appointed in local schools and businesses where this is a mandatory requirement. A course has been set up as part of a collaboration between Padova City Council, AcegasApsAmga S.p.A. and the University of Padova entitled "Sustainability ambassadors. Know, promote, practice sustainability". This educational programme is aimed at students taking any of the University of Padova's three-year and higher degree courses, as well as citizens, who can register for the programme as a standalone course. The course is sponsored by the Italian University Network for Sustainable Development (RUS);

targeted communication campaigns that need to be developed to suit the socioeconomic, demographic and cultural makeup of the various segments of the population living in the city, in order to pull the right levers and use the language and communication tools best suited to each geographical and residential context (digital communication vs traditional communication, etc.). During the preparation of the Climate City Contract, an initial communication campaign was launched, providing a platform for people to put forward proposals for actions aimed at reducing GHG emissions either on their own behalf or on behalf of a group (body, association, etc.). Communication campaigns must be devised to find new ways to overcome NIMBYism and the general resistance to the introduction of new construction sites around the city, which will inevitably become a feature of the cityscape for the next few years (early construction sites can already be seen due to work on the tram lines, "Bicipolitana" cycling network, and a number of urban redevelopment and building stock upgrade projects). Getting citizens on board with seeing construction sites everywhere will inevitably entail clear communication of the outcomes the project plans to achieve, presenting any transformation project as part of the bigger climate neutrality picture. In this sense, we need to think about developing consistent coordinated imagery that the public immediately associates with the Mission, while also providing people with the opportunity to report any inconvenience by scanning QR codes included on site signage. The next communication campaign will be up and running by Autumn 2024 and will be relaunched yearly through to 2030:

nudging actions that urge citizens to break with their old, entrenched ways (ones that are harmful to the environment) and introduce good behaviours in terms of how people move (nudge towards sustainable mobility solutions), how they manage municipal solid waste, and encouraging green purchasing (including signing up with clean electricity providers). These actions will be defined following the fact-finding investigations and in synergy with the various local actors who have signed Climate Agreements and who can offer "bonuses" for citizens to spend in businesses in and around the city or use on services (e.g. use of vehicle sharing services or LPT);
experiential pathways that prompt citizens to change their behaviour and support carbon neutrality, experiencing individual and collective advantages first hand through the direct use of new technologies or use of new services. The aim of these pathways is to encourage buy-in to the new solutions proposed, helping people understand their benefits and purpose, making them easy to utilize, increasing their appeal and making new lifestyles and habits attractive. This is particularly true for new digital technologies, with a large portion of the city's residents potentially left out when it comes to their use. The University of Padova, through its Department of Philosophy, Sociology, Education and Applied Psychology (FISPPA), will produce an initial pilot project with students on the university campus on Via Venezia, to assess their carbon footprint and test solutions to reduce it. The findings will be useful for scaling up the pilot trial to citizens in general. These experiential pathways may also be implemented in conjunction with nudging actions. A second pilot project entitled "Preparing for the city of the future: toward a climate-neutral Padova" will start in Fall 2024 under the technical and scientific responsibility of Prof. Adriano Zamperini and Dr. Marialuisa Menegatto of the University of Padova. The project presents an innovative approach as it conceives the energy transition and climate change management not only a matter of governments and institutions but objectives that can be pursued through co-design and involvement of civil society in its different forms, broadening the dimensions of democratic participation. Action toward community inclusion and well-being (empowerment) is thus enhanced through an active and proactive role of citizens. In this way, action will be taken in a multilevel, interconnected and cross-cutting manner, as is characteristic of sociotechnical systems, here paying special attention to the broad and diverse group of components of the "socio" subsystem (i.e., the human side of sociotechnical systems). The activities will take place with organizational collaboration between the City of Padova and the University of Padova and will involve the active participation of specific segments of the urban population of the city of Padova. It is planned to organize parallel Thematic Tables for homogeneous groups of social categories of residents or inhabitants of the Arcella

neighborhood of Padova (parents, the elderly, university students living in the neighborhood, immigrants, members of Catholic associations, commuter workers, etc.). The tables will be a place for sharing, discussion, and active participation of the local network committed toward the climate-neutral future city. With the informed consent of the participants, the work of the tables will be videotaped to be edited into short videos (duration about 3') and then disseminated to the general public, locally and also nationally, through a "Padova Net Zero City Visual Notice Board" uploaded on FISPPA and City of Padova websites and social channels;

forms of incentive for less well-off families, to encourage conversion of the private vehicle fleet to electric, to encourage the undertaking of energy upgrade work on housing and to promote sustainable mobility solutions as an alternative to cars, by issuing bonuses that can be spent on the city's vehicle sharing systems or for the use of local public transport. Building upgrade work will be encouraged by Padova's One-Stop Shop, which will introduce a community and support approach to help energy-poor families, making work more affordable by sharing the risk with business operators and other users in the community. Additional financial benefits will result from the forms of incentive provided for as part of the Renewable (and socially responsible) Energy Communities, which will be championed and created by Padova City Council, together with other local stakeholders. EV incentives are planned to supplement schemes already being put in place by regional and national governments, and incentives may also be issued by local financial service providers who have signed Climate Agreements, who will offer financial products specifically for this purpose.

Another issue on which the City Council and various stakeholders in Padova are focusing and which involves several activities that complement each other is that of food, in relation to which a number of projects are underway or in the planning stage under the leadership of various stakeholders in the city.

In July 2023, an internal working group was established within the City Council with the task of dealing with local food policies, specifically:

promote food sustainability in terms of emission impact and biodiversity protection;
promote the development of an urban agroecological system;
fighting food waste and reducing packaging consumption;
ensure access to healthy food and clean water for all;
promote education on healthy and sustainable food;
foster short supply chains and local markets.

In line with these objectives, two studies have been carried out, one on local experiences in containing food waste (University of Padova, Department of Political Science), the other on urban metabolism and the impact in terms of emissions of school canteens in Padova (ARUP). There are also a number of activities that have been underway for many years that are functional to a greater management and culture of food in Padova (including the Re.T.E. Solid.A project promoted by Acli Padova and included in the portfolio, thanks to which, starting in 2012, circuits have been created for the sustainable recovery and reuse of food surpluses, for the benefit of disadvantaged people, with the collaboration of a vast network of charities in the area).

One development that Acli and the City of Padova are working on, characterized by a social innovation component, involves the direct involvement of families in the distribution to vulnerable people of food saved from school canteen waste. The idea is to combine the goal of reducing waste (which undoubtedly has an impact in terms of emissions) with the social function of fighting loneliness, educating people about the value of food and bringing together components of society

that, without the right opportunity, might never cross paths.

Other projects are also being launched on the theme of food, reported below:

Regenerated Urban Agricultural Soils - RUAS project, funded by the Horizon program on the theme of soil health (City of Padova),
AgrifPD project for the co-definition and co-design of innovative solutions aimed at putting the role of agriculture and its functioning back at the center with a view to food and environmental sustainability (Etifor),
PNRR-funded Making Food Democracy project analyzing food policies in Padova and Trento aimed at defining a Padova Food Policy (University of Padova).

Other elements of social innovation, are:

the use of participatory budgeting for the benefit of the neighborhood councils, totaling €300,000 per year, which members of the councils can spend as they see fit to finance projects and activities in their target areas. This tool has existed for years, but the involvement of the Councils in the Padova 2030 pathway has made them aware of their potential active role, both in terms of involving the population and in financing projects and events on environmental issues. Thanks to participatory budgeting, each Council has, in fact, the opportunity to cast the issue of decarbonization in its own urban context, understanding the dynamics of its area of interest and trying to act in favor of the neighborhood. An example that emerged during the meetings with the Councils is the possibility of financing Thermo tours (funded by the City of Winter 2023-2024 as a service of its Energy Desk), that is, synthetic energy diagnoses at houses and apartments, so that citizens can be provided with free advice useful to know the state of consumption of their homes and the main interventions that can be carried out to improve their energy performance;
involvement of the population in financing decarbonization projects, with the dual result of having both an economic return and the satisfaction of having acted in favor of their city. An example is the Super-Heero project (concluded), which activated a crowdfunding system to redevelop a supermarket in Padova, and the RES Padova project (in the start-up phase), which again wants to involve the population, but this time to finance the redevelopment of sports centers;
economic support to families in poverty through subsidies provided by the Social Services Sector of the Municipality of Padova to meet the payment of energy bills, this because of the growing weight of the energy component on the family budget and the importance of ensuring adequate levels of comfort for families who otherwise could not afford it;
the "Bando Impatto +" by Banca Etica (a signatory of a Climate Accord) and Etica Sgr, in collaboration with Produzioni dal Basso, entitled Ethical Energy for Communities and Territories1 to crowdfund projects aimed at the renovation, regeneration and new energy efficiency interventions (including the installation of photovoltaic panels) of instrumental buildings of entities and organizations of the Third Sector and farms with organic certification.

With regard to the support of the public at large and the activation of social innovation measures, forms of local incentives offered by non-financial actors play an important role. The main role in this sphere is played by the local administration, which, starting from 2023, through the signing of the "Padova 2030" Manifesto of Renewable and Solidarity Energy Communities and the establishment of a PADOVA REC 2030 technical working group, is promoting processes that facilitate the establishment of new RECs both at a private level and in the city's industrial area.

An important role in this area is played by the Padova Energy Help Desk, a free service available to

all city residents, inaugurated in February 2021 to offer information and technical advice on the reduction of energy consumption, building upgrades, tax incentives, and bureaucratic procedures with respect to building and urban planning practices. The desk was created as part of the Padova FIT Expanded European project, which concluded in 2022, whose aim was to create and pilot a One Stop Shop service to directly connect supply and demand by providing citizens with information, technical, legal and financial assistance, as well as contractual and decision-making tools for the implementation and monitoring of energy-saving measures.

Funding for the Energy Desk continued even after the European project ended and is expected to be maintained until 2030 by contracting its operational management out to third parties. The cost to the municipality reported refers to the investment incurred from 2021 to the present.

To promote the intermodality of local public transport with other soft mobility solutions, Busitalia, an investee of the city, is promoting a discount of €10 per month for all its pass holders who use bicycle and scooter shared mobility services offered by the operators participating in the initiative, i.e. Ridemovii, Dott and Bit. The initiative is financed with resources from the National Fund for Public Transport allocated to the Veneto Region, and is valid until 30 June 2025 or until the available funds are exhausted. The cost reported refers to the three-year funding of the initiative.

As part of the dissemination of separate waste collection and eco-sustainable practices in private households, the municipality allows and encourages home composting of organic waste through a 30% reduction in the variable portion of the TARI.2 Composting is a natural process that transforms plant waste and the wet fraction of waste into compost, to be used as fertiliser for flowers and vegetables. To benefit from the reduction, the taxpayer must sign a special form and submit it to the city's Environment Department.

# 9 Outlook and next steps

## Final table – Plan for CCC monitoring and next CCC iteration

The strategy defined in the Climate City Contract maps out a well-defined pathway to climate neutrality for Padova.

The origins of this pathway can be traced back a long way, with the first planning initiative in the energy field dating back to 1999, while its focus on the future is marked by increasing ambition.

It is clear from the Plan how reaching climate neutrality entails a profound change, both in terms of new projects and synergies between various local stakeholders, and in terms of letting go of habits and behaviours that are incompatible with a climate-neutral city.

It is also clear how climate neutrality requires action across multiple areas, all of which are essential but none of which, on its own, is enough to change the city's fortunes.

So, in order to achieve the forecast outcome, a strong commitment is required from the city, by which we mean both the local government and all stakeholders and citizens alike, so as to produce a concerted effort with action focused on a number of different fields.

In the coming years, it will be essential to develop all the actions described in the Plan, starting with the strategic actions — part of which is already under way, while part is waiting to be implemented — forming the key pieces to complete the climate neutrality puzzle.

Residential, commercial, institutional and industrial building upgrades, sustainable mobility, end-use electrification, district heating, urban green spaces, improvement in waste collection, citizen and business communication and engagement: these are the keywords of Padova's decarbonization and, in the coming years, they will need to be the cornerstones of the City Council's actions and projects, as well as those of various other local stakeholders (starting with the signatories of the Climate Agreements) and the people of the city. A key factor in the implementation of this vision, and one that cuts across all these themes, is the city's digitalization, both on the Smart City front and in terms of the digital transition of local businesses and other entities. Technology and digital innovation are stepping stones to climate neutrality, and a way of helping the city achieve its 2030 climate goal more quickly and more effectively.

Innovation, though, does not stop at technology, instead extending to the social, too. The pathway described in the Climate City Contract outlines a process of change based on strategies and ideas that lead to Padova's economic and social development, taking into account the local community's inherent diversity and with particular regard for vulnerable segments of the population.

To ensure climate neutrality themes are being addressed, thematic working groups will be formed (or confirmed where they already exist) with local stakeholders, thus delivering ongoing, synergistic action on key decarbonization themes. These working groups cover: renewable energy communities (RECs), housing, industry, Innovation Hub, sustainable mobility and food policies (taking into account the emissions under scope 3).

Achieving climate neutrality and overcoming certain barriers that are hindering the ambition to date cannot be done without the contribution of bodies and institutions at a regional, governmental and European level, which is why Padova plans (where possible, in conjunction with the other Italian and European NZC Mission Cities) to involve these entities in its path to decarbonization. The higher-level institutions will be engaged to support Padova in removing regulatory barriers, in providing financial backing, and in encouraging sustainable local policies.

Lastly, the most important stakeholders of all, the ones for whom, and with whom, we want to reach climate neutrality: the people of Padova City. The change that Padova proposes to bring about is radical and the public needs to be aware of and involved in the efforts being made.

The city's residents are and will be key players in the Padova 2030 pathway; they will be informed, made aware and sometimes made accountable; they will be the users of new services and

innovative models for the city's transition, because, bottom line, the Padova of 2030 is the city belonging to the people who live there, and who will live there in the future, and its citizens are the real leading players in this ambitious path to a climate-neutral city.

The Monitoring Plan will be organized on two levels:

the territory's emission budget (i.e., the update of module A-1) will be monitored on an annual basis, involving all stakeholders who, at all scales, have the necessary data (from energy distributors to statistical data holders);
portfolio actions (module B-2) will be monitored biannually through the involvement of all stakeholders who have signed Climate Agreements;
some key actions (the strategic ones), on the other hand, will be monitored annually, in the manner outlined in Form B-3, allowing the Administration to continuously assess the area's transformation trend and, if necessary, allowing for corrective feedback.

Annual monitoring will allow to assess trends in a timely manner and, if necessary, to plan new reinforcing measures in cases where the trend is not sufficient to ensure that the initially planned targets are met. In such cases, new partners will be identified with whom to sign climate agreements and with or through whom to implement new actions on the ground.

Work with stakeholders and CCC signatories will be managed within the Living Lab and structured by topic areas. The Living Lab will be tasked with identifying existing barriers that prevent the full implementation of certain measures and devising new actions (including through applications to regional, national and European calls for proposals) that can facilitate the achievement of the planned objectives.

An important first evaluation step will be at the end of 2026/beginning of 2027, as the current mayor's term of office draws to a close and all investments made under the NRP are expected to be completed.

The first two years of the plan's implementation (2025-2026) will see the completion of works on the tramways and the "Bicipolitana" bikelanes and the start of the first pilot projects of the One Stop Shop. Communication and local involvement activities will get into full swing, prompting each member of the local community to contribute, even with small actions, to achieving the climate neutral goal.

Some trends already in place, such as the spread of new photovoltaic systems and the electrification of vehicle fleet and thermal heating systems, will be further accelerated through the provision of incentives and appropriate information campaigns. First assessments on the development of district heating will be developed and first pilot projects will be carried out, starting with areas with the greatest potential.

The mid-term evaluation at the end of 2026/beginning of 2027 will be crucial in assessing the effectiveness of the strategic actions identified in the document and will further allow new technologies not yet mature enough to be considered as good options for the climate neutrality.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

Padova's path towards climate neutrality began many years ago, when the City Energy Plan was approved in 1999. The energy and climate planning timeline has advanced over the years since:

in 2004, with the Energy Efficiency Plan
in 2009, with the Operational Energy Plan
in 2011, with the SEAP (Sustainable Energy Action Plan), which set 2020 targets
in 2016, with guidelines for drawing up the Adaptation Plan
in 2021, with the SECAP (Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan) with new 2030 targets.

The SECAP, i.e. the current Plan, commits the city to reducing emissions in its territory by 55% by 2030 (base year 2005), aiming for climate neutrality by 2050.

However, the seriousness of climate change at a global level and the urgency to act to counter it as quickly and seriously as possible have prompted the City of Padova to set itself an even more ambitious goal, namely achieving climate neutrality by 2030. This is why, when the opportunity to apply and join the NZC Mission arose, the City decided to get involved and raise the bar of its climate commitment.

The process to develop the Climate City Contract stems firstly from the analysis of the area's current emissions, which clearly shows the sectors where the most aggressive action should be taken, and secondly from the identification – also thanks to the contribution of local stakeholders – of the actions to be implemented first to achieve climate neutrality. This analysis also naturally takes into account the main barriers and opportunities related to each policy area.

At the level of single sources of emissions, the need to take action in the building and transport sectors is evident, in former case through a massive energy upgrade of buildings (residential and industrial) in Padova, in the latter through the creation of new infrastructures and services that favour sustainable mobility.

Two other fundamental aspects emerged during the development of the Climate City Contract. First, the need to massively involve the local area, understood both as local authorities and as the public at large, since most emissions are not directly controllable by city authorities, and therefore the achievement of climate neutrality must envisage a close collaboration with local organisations and inhabitants. Second, the need to implement new models of innovative financing strongly involving private individuals, since the cost of decarbonising Padova (as in any European city) cannot be sustained only through public funding. In this regard, from an economic point of view it is crucial that climate neutrality be seen not just as a cost, but as an opportunity.

The Padova Climate City Contract therefore aims to reduce emissions in its territory by 80%, with 2021 as its base year. The challenge is truly daunting given the little time available. Being part of the NZC Mission, however, is also a great opportunity to address the decarbonisation of European cities in a synergistic way and with continuous dialogue. Padova mainly hopes to obtain four things from the Mission:

a continuous dialogue with other European cities that have experimented with new solutions to common problems, so that we can learn from the successes (or failures) of others;
technical support, in the form of consultancy, as it is often complicated to have staff with specific expertise in municipal governments;
funding opportunities specifically aimed at the implementation of Climate City Contracts;
listening to the legislative issues that cities face, and support in trying to solve the regulatory barriers that sometimes hinder decarbonisation.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

## Goal

The goal that Padova has set for itself to achieve by 2030 is an 80% reduction in climate-changing emissions in its territory, with 2021 as the base year, i.e. the year the SECAP was approved. The remaining 20% needed to achieve climate neutrality falls under so-called hard-to-abate emissions, which will be addressed after 2030 as per NZC guidelines. These emissions mainly includes civil and industrial users that, due to their geographical location (e.g. city centre), type of industrial process (e.g. heavy manufacturing industry), or building characteristics (e.g. listed or valuable buildings) are not among the buildings that will benefit from energy upgrades by 2030 (or only partially). There will also be some transport-related emissions that cannot be abated by 2030. Some heavy or light road vehicles will continue to run using endothermic diesel or petrol engines, as the market does not yet offer viable solutions for the total electrification of the vehicle fleet. Moreover, many vehicles will not yet have exhausted the multi-year depreciation of their purchase cost and thus cannot be expected to be replaced before that date.

A total reduction in emissions will therefore take longer, which is why it was decided in the CCC to aim for an 80% emission reduction.

The entire territory is covered with the exception of two ETS facilities, i.e. the hospital of Padova and the Acciaierie Venete company, which are not included in the emission budget of Padova, as per NZC guidelines.

For the calculation of emissions, emission factors of the IPCC GHG approach were applied in terms of tCO2eq, based on the methodological framework developed in 2006 by the IPCC. The emission sectors considered are buildings, transport, waste, industrial processes and product use (IPPU) and agriculture forestry and other land uses (AFOLU).

Emissions refer to Scope 1, i.e. those generated by combustion processes within the city, and Scope 2, i.e. those referring to energy consumption distributed through networks where the energy generation process takes place outside the system boundaries. Excluded for the time being is Scope 3, i.e. emissions generated outside the city but related to processes taking place therein, but which the administration intends to focus on in the years to come, particularly with regard to the food and clothing value chain.

In the coming years, Padova will therefore see a considerable transformation, not only from a structural and sometimes infrastructural point of view, but also in terms of new services for the benefit of the public. We expect that the appearance and liveability of the city will change a lot in a short time, but above all that new synergies, new projects and new initiatives will be organised for the benefit of the entire area.

# 3 Strategic priorities

## Strategic priorities

Below is a brief description of some of the strategic priorities of the Padova CCC, together with a list of the main initiatives that will be implemented by 2026.

### The built environment

A key theme of Padova's CCC concerns residential, commercial and institutional buildings and industry, which account for 76% of final energy usage in the city. Various measures are envisaged to drastically reduce climate-altering emissions, from the replacement of boilers and generators with electric heat pumps possibly powered by renewable sources, to the creation of a district heating
COMUNE di PADOVA

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

network that can also make use of some thermal waste currently dissipated by the waste-to-energy plant, urban waste and local companies that have residual heat downstream of their production cycles.

In recent years, Padova has seen a rather high rate of building heritage redevelopment, with investments amounting to some 357 million euros mobilised thanks to the Superbonus 110 scheme. However, it is necessary to create the ideal conditions for the rate of redevelopment to remain high in the years to come. To achieve this goal, Padova Council aims to build a new One-Stop Shop: a public-private entity designed to bring together energy upgrade initiatives for residential, commercial, institutional and industrial buildings and to present private business operators (ESCOs) with investment package proposals, creating advantageous economies of scale and promoting Energy Efficiency Contracts.

% of the Climate City Contract target in terms of emission reduction (574,893 tonnes of CO2) is linked to this group of measures in the area of civil and industrial buildings.

## Mobility and transport

The city transport sector, which accounts for 24% of final energy usage, is a key part of the decarbonization strategy. In order to reduce mobility-related emissions, action will be taken with a variety of integrated measures that will change the way people travel around the city.

Without a doubt the most important project is the city-wide tram network system - SMART, which will see the construction of two new lines and the connection with modal interchange systems on the outskirts of the city to help reduce the number of entries in the city. While very important, this project must necessarily be part of a broader strategy. The other measures aimed at improving mobility in Padova envisaged in the CCC are:

the gradual replacement of diesel buses in local public transport with new electric vehicles powered by renewable sources,
the promotion of cycling through the full completion of Padova's Bicipolitana and the widespread installation of bike racks and bike boxes,
the implementation of mobility management policies through local companies and schools with mobility managers and the promotion of Mobility as a Service (MaaS),
the creation of a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and the introduction of an Ultra LEZ, to progressively limit the circulation of the most polluting vehicles,
electrification of the private vehicle fleet, facilitated by incentives and the installation of charging points in cities.

% of the Climate City Contract target in terms of emission reduction (172,489 tonnes of CO2) is linked to this group of measures in the area of sustainable mobility and transport.

## Energy systems

The progressive installation of roof-mounted photovoltaic panels and the activation of Renewable Energy Communities should ensure an increase in the share of electricity needs met by locally produced renewables.

Legambiente's Renewable Municipalities study shows that in 2023 Padova was the city with the most photovoltaic installations per capita in Italy (around 15 MW installed in total). This extremely positive trend is expected to continue according to a linear trend, taking advantage of the available roof space on both civil and industrial buildings. The proliferation of the plants, with particular reference to the city centre, should be facilitated by easing legal and regulatory restrictions, protecting the landscape and the historical and cultural heritage of the City of Padova.

% of the Climate City Contract target in terms of emission reduction (98,952 tonnes of CO2) is linked to this group of measures in the area of energy systems.

With respect to the strategic priorities described above, the timetable includes several intermediate targets to be reached in the years indicated and to be closely monitored to ensure that the implementation of the CCC is not delayed. In order to verify the general progress of the city's decarbonisation process, Padova Council has also undertaken to produce and annual emissions report, while a detailed monitoring of the actions is planned every two years, both with regard to actions of the City and those of stakeholders.

In order to effectively implement the CCC, some supra-communal stakeholders are very important to involve, including: the regional government, central ministries, the GSE, energy distributors. These actors can contribute in different ways: from a legislative point of view, by removing some regulatory barriers to the decarbonisation process, with targeted funding, by sharing data or by adapting the area to the ongoing ecological transition. In part these collaborations are already in place, for the others it is Padova's intention to strengthen them in the future.
COMUNE di PADOVA

O

At the local level, among the most relevant stakeholders in terms of impact and possible future collaborations is certainly the University of Padova, with which a collaboration protocol was signed for the Padova 2030 pathway, especially for the wide-ranging expertise it can make available for the decarbonisation of Padova.

Other key stakeholders are the banks, three for now, which can provide the city with various instruments for decarbonisation, as well as their expertise in innovative finance.

Other key stakeholders are those pertaining to the industrial sector, which represents a significant constituency in Padova. These actors have a very high potential for innovation and can be drivers of change for the city.

Lastly, the whole world of associations, which are able to reach the population of Padova and its various souls, is of vital importance for the involvement of the public.

# 4 Process and principles

# Process and principles

Following the process initiated in 2023 with the Living Lab in Padova, six topical tables with local stakeholders will be organised (or confirmed if they already exist) in order to pursue the actions of the CCC in a continuous and synergistic manner. These working groups cover: renewable energy communities (RECs), housing, industry, Innovation Hub, sustainable mobility and food policies. The parts related to financing and communications will be discussed in all Living Lab tables, as both are necessary to ensure that the ideas and projects that emerge are implemented and well communicated.

Each year Padova Council will take stock of the territory's emissions, while every two years all actions by the municipality and stakeholders will be monitored.

The CCC is also intended as a living document, a strategy that can be modified and implemented in future years. If there are new actions to be added, either by existing or new stakeholders, it will be possible to do so, just as it will be possible to adjust current strategies should circumstances so require. In short, the implementation of the CCC will require continuous observation and updating, coordinated by Padova Council, but carried out in cooperation with the whole area.

# 6 Sample contract with signatures

# AGREEMENT TO DRAFT THE CLIMATE CITY CONTRACT OF THE CITY OF PADOVA AND ACHIEVE CLIMATE NEUTRALITY BY 2030

## WHEREAS:

the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has repeatedly sounded the alarm on the irreversible effects of climate change, calling on states to take urgent decisions;
in 2015, the new Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy initiative was launched in which signatory cities commit to actively support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and agree to adopt an integrated approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation;
in December 2019, the European Council endorsed the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 and EU leaders took note of the Commission's communication on the Green Deal;
in December 2020, the European Commission launched the European Climate Pact, an initiative calling on individuals, communities and organisations to participate in climate action and build a greener Europe;
in December 2020, the European Council endorsed a binding EU target of a net internal reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and called on the Council and Parliament to take this new target into account in the proposed European climate law;
in May 2021, the ambassadors to the EU approved the final compromise text for the European climate law, which was agreed between the Council and Parliament negotiators in April 2021;
in September 2021, the European Commission announced the launch of the Mission '100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities' to select 100 frontrunner cities that intend to be climate neutral by 2030;
in April 2023, the Council formally adopted five pieces of legislation from the 'Fit for 55%' package that will enable the EU to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in key sectors of the economy, while ensuring that the most vulnerable citizens and micro-businesses, as well as sectors exposed to the risk of carbon leakage, receive effective support in the climate transition;

## BEARING IN MIND THAT

on 14/06/2021, with City Council Resolution no. 2021/0064, the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (secap) was approved, a document of a strategic nature that outlines the set of policies and actions that the Administration intends to implement in the coming years, with a time horizon of 2030, with the aim of drastically reducing climate-changing emissions in the territory, in line with the reduction targets set at international, European and national level:
the SECAP includes 116 actions for territorial mitigation and adaptation to climate change;
on 19 January 2022, the Municipality of Padova, in the person of the Mayor, expressed its interest in participating in the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission initiative;
on 29 April 2022, the European Commission announced the list of 100 cities in Europe that will test innovative solutions and decarbonisation strategies to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, and the Municipality of Padova is among them;
COMUNE di PADOVA

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

C

the strategy of the SECAP will be reworked and strengthened in the so-called Climate City Contract, a strategic document in which to indicate the actions planned to achieve climate neutrality that the cities of the Mission are invited to elaborate by the European Commission;

## CONSIDERED THAT:

the activation of partnerships between the public and private sectors is a fundamental lever for promoting the sustainable development of the territory and achieving the ambitious goal of climate neutrality by 2030;
the partnership will take concrete form through the signing of a Climate Agreement, in which each of the parties involved will commit to implementing actions and policies to reduce energy consumption and climate-changing emissions and will identify areas for mutual collaboration, to the benefit of local communities and the territory;
the Agreement will be included in the Climate City Contract, a document of a strategic nature and shared with local stakeholders, which will outline Padova's strategy in achieving climate neutrality by 2030;

## ALL OF THE ABOVE:

The Municipality of Padova, with registered office in Via del Municipio 1, 35122 Padova, Tax Code 00644060287, legally represented by the Mayor pro tempore Sergio Giordani;

# DEFINIZIONE AZIONI
Varisco Srl (Part of Atlas Copco Group - FAM Code ITH)

|  Definizione dell'azione | Nome dell'azione | Science Based Targets - Riduzione CO2 KPI  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Tipologia | Mitigazione  |
|   |  Ambito d'intervento | Altro (specificare nel campo descrizione)  |
|   |  Descrizione | L'azione si inserisce all'interno del Progetto di adesione del Gruppo Atlas Copco ai Science Based Target.
Per ogni dettaglio si rimanda al Portale SBT (https://sciencebasedtargets.org/).
Il Gruppo ha definito dei targets da raggiungere entro la scadenza del 2030 per ogni Ambito (definitit Scope 1-Scope 2-Scope 3) associati misurabili KPI:
Tonnellate di CO2 emesse in ambito 1 & 2 (Energia e veicoli); Riduzione del 46% entro il 2030 (calcolo su base 2019)
Tonnellate di CO2 emesse in ambito 3 (trapsorti e viaggi aerei); Riduzione del 28% entro il 2030 (calcolo su base 2019)
Altro KPI significativo per l'ambito Scope 3 relativo ai prodotti all'interno del loro ciclo di vita è il seguente:
% di Nuovi progetti di sviluppo prodotti con riduzione della quantità di CO2 nel ciclo di vita inferiore alla gamma precedente; 100% entro il 2030 (calcolo su base 2019).
Il focus sui primi due KPI è il seguente:
Riduzione della CO2 emessa dalle utilities a servitù dello stabilimento e dai prodotti utilizzati e consumati nel processo produttivo, pertanto l'ambito delle azioni è incentrato sulla riduzione dei consumi di Gas Naturale, Energia Elettrica, Carburanti e Trasporti. L'azione oltre ad essere mirata sull'ottimizzazione dei consumi in se (è stata effettuata un analisi energetica per definire i punti di miglioramento) prevende anche l'installazione di un impianto fotovoltaico di 265 kWp pari ad una copertura di circa il 70% del consumo con conseguente emissione di CO2 (per la parte residua verrà utilizzata energia elettrica coperta da GO come da Direttiva 2009/28/CE), l'installazione di una nuova impianto di riscaldamento (prevista una riduzione del consumo del 25%) l'introduzione del carburante HVO in sostituzione del Diesel (prevista una riduzione del 80% di emissione di CO2, sensibilizzazione nei confronti della catena di fornitura ad utilizzare carburanti alternativi (HVO per trasporti via gomma o SAF per trasporti via aerea) o mezzi elettrici ma solo se alimentati da energia rinnovabile. Tale requisito per i trasportatori diverrà nel prossimo futuro requisito vincolante per la qualifica degli stessi ma ad oggi non sono previste scadenze temporali.
In merito al terzo KPI relativo ai prodotti le nuova gamme prevedono oltre a miglioramento dell'efficienza con riduzione dei consumi e di CO2 prodotta nel ciclo di vita, l'introduzione di macchine compatibili con l'HVO e di macchine fully electric. Ad oggi non sono definiti target di riduzione ma solo la quantità di prodotti nuovi con riduzione di CO2 comparata sulla gamma  |

|   |  Descrizione | L'Università di Padova, nell'ambito delle sue attività istituzionali di Terza Missione, organizza centinaia di eventi all'anno tra cui seminari, conferenze, incontri, rassegne e spettacoli promossi sia dall'Amministrazione centrale che dai 32 Dipartimenti e 15 Centri. Nel 2022, anno dell'Ottocentenario, solo il palinsesto Universa, costituito da manifestazioni quali il festival Risvegli all'Orto Botanico, le iniziative di "Science for all" dedicate alla divulgazione scientifica e altri eventi istituzionali quali le Nobel lectures, ha registrato oltre 200.000 presenze. Diverse sono state le iniziative messe in campo negli anni per ridurre l'impatto ambientale degli eventi di Ateneo, soprattutto a livello di Amministrazione centrale, in linea con gli impegni definiti nella Carta degli Impegni di sostenibilità 2018-2022. Tra questi: - la drastica riduzione dei prodotti a stampa (programmi di sala, locandine, flyer), prediligendo segnaletica riutilizzabile e, laddove necessario stampare, utilizzando carte certificate FSC o ottenute dagli scarti di lavorazioni alimentari o altre; - l'attenta scelta dei gadget, laddove previsti, prediligendo merchandising prodotto responsabilmente e non marchiandolo con l'anno di riferimento in modo da poterlo riproporre in altre occasioni; - l'eliminazione della plastica monouso, utilizzando bottigliette e bicchieri di vetro, carta o materiali biodegradabili. Con la Carta degli Impegni di sostenibilità 2023-2027 ci si è posti l'obiettivo di mettere a sistema queste e altre buone pratiche attraverso l'adozione e implementazione di un modello certificabile per l'organizzazione degli eventi in linea con le policy di sostenibilità. Nel 2023 è stata condotta quindi un'analisi di fattibilità con l'obiettivo di valutare la conformità delle attuali pratiche adottate nell'organizzazione di eventi alle linee guida contenute nella norma ISO 21121:2012 "Event sustainability management systems" e le pratiche da integrare per allinearsi allo standard. Oggetto dell'analisi è stata l'Inaugurazione dell'anno accademico, l'evento che per complessità, rilevanza, numero di processi e persone coinvolte rappresenta il caso studio più completo e costituirà il caso "pilota" dal quale verrà avviato il processo di certificazione. L'Ateneo quindi procederà dapprima con il conseguimento della certificazione sul singolo evento dell'Inaugurazione dell'anno accademico per poi elaborare un modello applicabile da tutte le strutture e uffici di Ateneo per l'organizzazione di eventi, dal più semplice al più complesso. Questa esperienza sarà inoltre condivisa nell'ambito del Protocollo d'Intesa tra la Regione Veneto, ARPAV e Unioncamere Veneto, siglato nel 2019. Nel 2024 il Tavolo Tecnico ha scelto quale tema da approfondire la sostenibilità degli eventi. E' prevista entro il 2024 la redazione di un documento guida con il contributo di tutti i partner che sarà a disposizione di enti e realtà del territorio.  |
|   |  Data di inizio e fine attività | Le attività di studio e indagine preliminari sono state svolte nel periodo compreso fra agosto e ottobre 2023; lo sviluppo del sistema di gestione degli eventi sostenibili con applicazione all'evento pilota (inaugurazione dell'anno accademico) avverrà entro il 2024. Il modello gestionale verrà poi adottato per tutti gli eventi futuri dell'Ateneo, sulla base delle linee guida redatte con l'obiettivo di fornire un supporto per l'adozione delle pratiche di sostenibilità nell'organizzazione degli eventi anche da parte delle strutture decentrate.  |
|  Implementazione | Ufficio responsabile dell'implementazione | L'azione verrà adottata dagli uffici dell'Area Comunicazione e Marketing con il supporto del CESQA - Centro Studi Qualità Ambiente del Dipartimento di Ingegneria Civile, Edile e Ambientale dell'Università di Padova.  |

| Ambito d'intervento | Altro (dettagliare nel campo descrizione) |
| Descrizione | Il progetto STAGEGO si propone di rafforzare lo sviluppo economico sostenibile dei soggetti teatrali dell'area interessata attraverso l'efficientamento di pratiche di stoccaggio e gestione dei magazzini del patrimonio tessile di due importanti player dell'ambito spettacolo: il Teatro Stabile del Veneto - Teatro Nazionale e il Teatro Nazionale Sloveno di Nova Gorica. I due partner possiedono infatti un grande patrimonio tessile, che conta complessivamente di circa 16500 pezzi, la cui gestione non è organizzata al meglio. I costumi non sono ben catalogati, non esiste un criterio condiviso nella loro archiviazione, non c'è una gestione generale della loro manutenzione e complessivamente manca una reale consapevolezza di ciò che è veramente in possesso dei teatri.
Per questo motivo, TSV ed SNGNG con il progetto STAGEGO intendono creare un magazzino digitale condiviso, che li porti a individuare una metodologia di archiviazione e catalogazione che risponda alle loro esigenze produttive e che, soprattutto, permetta loro di condividere il patrimonio tessile a seconda delle necessità, applicando il principio di economia circolare. |

| Descrizione | Il network European Theatre si sta impegnando attivamente a diventare una rete di teatri a emissioni zero entro il 2030, come stabilito nel Codice d'Azione per la Sostenibilità di ETC.
Un passo significativo in questo percorso verso la sostenibilità è la creazione dell'ETC Theatre Green Book, una collaborazione tra ETC, Renew Culture e la rinomata iniziativa "Theatre Green Book". L'ETC Theatre Green Book è una nuova versione dello strumento per guidare i teatri, passo dopo passo, verso emissioni nette zero – nelle loro produzioni, edifici e operazioni. I teatri membri del network sono direttamente coinvolti.
Dal 2025, con l'ingresso nel network, il TSV si auspica di diventare uno dei teatri in cui applicare le linee guida pubblicate. Sarebbe utile, con il Comune di Padova, immaginare un edificio più green, come da linee guida pubblicate qui: https://theatregreenbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GREEN-BOOK-2_00_beta.pdf, rendere le produzioni più sostenibili: https://theatregreenbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/THEATRE-GREEN-BOOK-ONE_beta1.pdf e i processi: https://theatregreenbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GREEN-BOOK-3_01_Beta.pdf |

|   |  Tipologia | Mitigazione  |
|   |  Ambito d'intervento | Altro (specificare nel campo descrizione)  |
|   |  Descrizione | Il generatore di Vapore veniva gestito con set point di lavoro costante. In questo modo, veniva constantemente prodotta una certa quantità di vapore, utilizzata poi nei processi di stabilimento. Tuttavia, accadeva che non sempre tutto questo vapore/energia era utilizzata subito, e quindi capitava che questo vapore, in attesa di essere consumato, tendesse a raffreddarsi, ed avesse necessità di essere nuovamente riscaldato. Grazie all'utilizzo della tecnologia, ed in particolare modo dell'automazione e delle reti di telecomunicazioni, adesso è possibile conoscere anche a qualche km di distanza, in che stato si tova un determinato processo, e quindi se e quando avrà bisogno di vapore/energia. Sfruttando questa informazione, si regola il funzionamento del generatore di vapore, che produce il vapore solo quando è necessario, perché c'è un processo che lo richiede, e nella quantità corretta, senza eccessi. In questo modo si ottimizza l'intero processo e la stessa rete di distribuzione vapore di stabilimento.  |

| Descrizione | Con questa iniziativa ASCOM PADOVA vuole premiare i comportamenti ambientalmente virtuosi grazie all'assegnazione di un marchio, che verrà rilasciato all'impresa o all'associazione che avrà raggiunto una soglia minima di punteggio.
Per effettuare questo tipo di valutazione Confcommercio si è affidata alla Scuola Universitaria Superiore Sant'Anna di Pisa che attribuirà il marchio Imprendigreen secondo tre diversi livelli di eccellenza (tre, quattro e cinque stelle) in relazione alla diversa intensità dell'impegno ambientale di ogni azienda.
All'Ascom, proprio per favorire l'acquisizione del marchio da parte delle imprese, è stato istituito uno specifico "Sportello Imprendigreen".
L'obiettivo di questa iniziativa è quello di sensibilizzare le nostre imprese ed i loro clienti e premiare l'impegno ambientale del terziario di mercato, favorendo occasioni di crescita e di sviluppo, rendendo le stesse imprese protagoniste della transizione ecologica, che rappresenta un'opportunità e una sfida da vincere prima di tutto partendo dal territorio. |
