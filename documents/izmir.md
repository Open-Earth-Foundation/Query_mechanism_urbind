# Summary

Cities play a crucial role in achieving climate neutrality. The most important reasons for this are that cities are the regions with the highest population and electricity consumption, and that strong networks that will channelize them towards climate targets are also located in cities.

The European Green Deal's goals of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030 and becoming the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 will be impossible to achieve without cities spearheading joint efforts. Therefore, following the radical and innovative path offered by the EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission for cities offers an important opportunity to achieve these goals.

Izmir is aware of how critical it is to achieve the goals set in the European Green Deal and be a part of the solution in this period when the effects of climate change are increasingly becoming more severe.

Following the path offered by the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission means creating a city alliance in the fight against climate change without leaving anyone behind. Therefore, as a first step, Izmir focused on creating a fair, inclusive governance model by calling on the quintuple helix framework of the ecosystem (public, private sector, civil society, media) to be a part of the city alliance. It was met with great interest throughout the city in the awareness meetings held. Thanks to the existing capacity in Izmir's ecosystem, Global Climate Community (GCC) Izmir was established with great ambition.

We are aware that achieving the climate neutrality target in 2030 is a challenging goal due to reasons such as Izmir being the country's 3rd largest metropolitan city and an important industrial center. The city's desire and potential to work on climate change encourages Izmir to overcome this challenge.

Therefore, as a first step The Climate City Contract Action Plan builds on the city's existing action plans and strategies. Apart from that as a strong effort has been made to communicate the three elements of the Climate City Contract with each other. The point reached during the preparation of the Climate City Contract excites us to find more creative, fair and inclusive solutions in the coming periods.

We wholeheartedly believe that Izmir will be a unique living laboratory in its climate neutrality goal with its current capacity, perspective and ambition against climate change.

# 2 Introduction

## Introduction

The city of İzmir, nestled on the Aegean coast of Türkiye, is poised to embark on an ambitious journey towards climate neutrality and smart city transformation. As a pioneer city in the environmental protection and renewable energy, İzmir recognizes the urgent need to address the global climate crisis and embrace innovative technologies and sustainable practices for a more resilient and prosperous future.

The development of the Climate City Contract Action Plan marks a significant milestone in İzmir's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to the impacts of climate change, and fostering a smart and sustainable urban environment. This Action Plan outlines a comprehensive roadmap that sets clear objectives, strategies, and measures to bridge the gap between the current state and the envisioned climate-neutral and smart city future.

The local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed is defined by several key factors. First and foremost, İzmir acknowledges the alarming consequences of climate change, such as rising temperatures, changing weather patterns, and increased vulnerability to natural hazards. Recognizing the pressing need for action, the city has already taken steps to mitigate these challenges by introducing renewable energy initiatives, promoting energy efficiency, and adopting sustainable transportation systems.

However, despite these efforts, İzmir faces significant gaps in its transition to a climate-neutral and smart city. One of the foremost challenges lies in the limited integration of cutting-edge technologies and data-driven solutions into urban infrastructure and governance systems. There is a need to harness the potential of digital innovation, IoT (Internet of Things), and artificial intelligence to enhance energy efficiency, optimize resource management, and improve the quality of life for İzmir's residents.

Moreover, while existing policies and programs have made progress in reducing carbon emissions, the current strategies lack a holistic and coordinated approach. The Climate City Contract Action Plan aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive framework that aligns diverse stakeholders, streamlines policies, and mobilizes resources to maximize the impact of climate actions and accelerate the city's transformation towards sustainability.

In summary, the Climate City Contract Action Plan serves as a strategic guide for İzmir's journey towards climate neutrality and smart city development. By recognizing the local policy context and addressing the existing gaps, the Action Plan will pave the way for a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable İzmir, positioning the city as a shining example for other regions in Türkiye and the European Union at large.

# A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

The latest GHG Baseline Inventory for the city of Izmir has been prepared in the year of 2020 by the Izmir Metropolitan Municipality as part of its commitment to the Covenant of Mayor. The inventory has aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of GHG emissions of the city and the key source of evidence on Izmir's GHG emissions trends. In the end, it helped the city to monitor progress towards its emissions reduction targets.

The base year for the inventory has been set as 2018 by considering comprehensive and reliable data availability.

The baseline emission inventory for the territory of Izmir has been calculated using the prevalent activity-based methodology, widely adopted by cities. This approach comprehensively encompasses all greenhouse gas emissions stemming from energy consumption, both directly (via fuel combustion) and indirectly (via electricity usage).

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ,  $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ ,  $\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O}$  emissions have all been covered in the inventory due to Izmir's commitment to a holistic assessment. The assessment incorporates emissions from waste  $(\mathrm{CH}_{4})$ , wastewater  $(\mathrm{CH}_{4}, \mathrm{~N}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ , enteric fermentation  $(\mathrm{CH}_{4})$  within livestock, and the utilization of chemical fertilizers  $(\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O})$  in agricultural practices.

In the latest baseline inventory (conducted in 2020), the inventory boundary has been identified as the whole city of Izmir. It has mainly caused by the New Metropolitan Municipalities Law (6360), enacted in 2012 in Türkiye. The law expanded the administrative boundaries of metropolitan municipalities to the provincial boundaries. Thus, the jurisdiction of Izmir Metropolitan Municipality has been expended from central 19 districts to all 30 districts in 2014.

The sectors covered in the baseline inventory has included building, transport, waste and wastewater facilities, and agriculture (fertilizers) and livestock (enteric fermentation, manure management). Due to the complexity of calculations and data requirements, agricultural crops and residue related emissions have not been included in the inventory. The industrial GHG emissions have been calculated but not included in the baseline emission inventory of 2018.

In the inventory for the year 2018, IPCC has been preferred for emission factors of energy carriers.

IPCC, Tier-1 and Tier-2 methodology has been taken as basis for greenhouse gas calculations. Accordingly, it's been reported that the following formula have been used in the calculations according to the types of Scope-1, Scope-2 and Scope-3 greenhouse gas resources:

$$
E_{GHG} = M_{Fuel} \cdot EF
$$

where $E_{GHG}$ is the amount of greenhouse emissions, $M_{Fuel}$ is the fuel consumption and EF is the emissions factor.

It has been projected that Izmir's population will reach to 5.03 million ca in 2030 by considering annual population growth rate of $1.3\%$.

Table 1 and Figure 1 in section A-1.5 above are evaluated here.

GHG emissions including all energy carriers and emissions sources in the geographical and administrative boundaries of the city has been calculated as 25,062,569 tCO2e/y for 2018. The detailed breakdown can be seen in Table 1. Information has been disaggregated into sub-sectors in line with CoM guidelines. This analysis indicates that fuel consumption in buildings and industry accounted for the largest source of emissions, representing nearly $55.4\%$ of the total emissions (Table 1). This sector is dominated by industrial buildings with a share of $56.7\%$, residential properties following second which account for $25.9\%$ of emissions from buildings (or $31.4\%$ and $14.3\%$ of total emissions respectively). Transport is the second biggest emitter with a share of $23.1\%$. Waste and wastewater emissions account for around $2.8\%$ of the total, while agriculture and livestock represent roughly $8.2\%$ (excluding irrigation). Energy generation from fuel for own use account for $3.7\%$ of total emissions and irrigation account for $0.8\%$ of the total. When calculating industry emissions national statistics have been taken into account for fuel consumptions and electricity. For process emissions only fugitive emissions of clinker production is calculated since there was not information for calculating other process or fugitive emissions from other industrial sectors. Fuel consumption for energy generation is related with only electricity generation for own use (auto producers).

Izmir is the hub for the Aegean region, concentrating not only the industrial and commercial activities of the Province of Izmir but also naturally attracting neighbouring provinces such as Manisa, Uşak and Denizli. The long-term promotion of road transport by national policies and the neglect of rail in passenger as well as commercial transport has exploded automobile use both within the Izmir Province, among towns and prominently in and out of Izmir, but also to and from neighbouring Provinces mentioned above. In Figure 1, private car ownerships for instance has increased by $25\%$ during the past four years, much higher than population growth. According to Figure 1, the highest greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 were industry with $31.4\%$. Other most greenhouse gas emission sources are transportation with $23\%$, residential with $14.3\%$ and agriculture with $8.2\%$.

# A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers and opportunities – textual elements

With its multidimensional and multi-sectoral economic structure, İzmir has an important potential in terms of industry, agriculture, tourism, and service main sectors. The largest share in greenhouse gas emissions belongs to the industry sector with a ratio of 31.4%, followed by transportation with a rate of 23%, residences with a rate of 14.3% and agricultural activities with a rate of 8.2% (IMM SECAP, 2018)

# Systems and Systemic Barriers

**Energy System:** This encompasses the production, distribution, and consumption of energy within the city. Systemic barriers within the energy system could include a heavy reliance on fossil fuels, inadequate renewable energy infrastructure, and inefficient energy use in buildings and transportation. **Reliance on Fossil Fuels:** İzmir's energy mix is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, particularly coal and natural gas, for electricity generation and transportation, leading to high greenhouse gas emissions. **Inefficient Buildings:** Many buildings in İzmir lack energy-efficient designs and technologies, leading to excessive energy consumption for heating, cooling, and lighting.

**Limited Renewable Energy Integration:** Despite its potential for solar and wind energy, İzmir's renewable energy capacity remains underutilized due to regulatory and technical barriers. Subsidies for competing fuels.

The following items provide a prime example of the difficulties encountered:

Lack of legal framework for independent power.
Producers
Lack of enabling energy policy at EU level.
Transaction costs.

**Transportation System:** This involves the networks and modes of transportation that move people and goods around the city. Systemic barriers may include a lack of public transportation options, inefficient traffic management, and a high number of privately owned vehicles. **Lack of Sustainable Transportation:** Insufficient public transportation options, limited cycling infrastructure, and high reliance on personal vehicles contribute to traffic congestion and emissions.
METROPOLITAN MUNICIPALITY

The following items provide a prime example of the difficulties encountered:

Lack of enabling transport policy at EU level.
Spatial dispersion or uneven accessibility.
Psychosocial barriers to public transport use. (Risk of transmission of infections, exposure to crime and verbal offense)
Psychosocial barriers to automated transport systems. (Such as driverless shuttles)

Urban Planning and Infrastructure: This relates to the layout, design, and development of the city. Systemic barriers might include zoning regulations that encourage urban sprawl, insufficient green spaces, and a lack of integration between land use and transportation planning. Urban planning policies that promote sprawl can lead to increased energy consumption for transportation and contribute to fragmented communities.

Waste Management System: Inadequate waste separation (mixed waste collection scheme) and recycling infrastructure result in significant amounts of organic waste going to landfills, contributing to methane emissions. Izmir is also observed to be one of the provinces in Türkiye that produces the most waste, producing one fourth of all hazardous waste produced in the country by itself. Despite the recovery potential of the waste types produced, the waste recycling rate remains at the very low level of 10%.

The following items provide a prime example of the difficulties encountered:

Insufficient waste separation and quality of separated waste.
Difficult balancing between promoting recycling and protecting consumers against harmful chemical substances in recycled materials.
Inefficient energy recovery of waste.
Limited community engagement and support.

Economic and Financial Systems: These refer to the financial mechanisms and incentives that influence investment and economic activities within the city. Systemic barriers might include subsidies for fossil fuels, lack of funding for sustainable projects, and financial constraints on implementing climate-friendly initiatives. Financial instability problems experienced recently in our country create inflation increase, medium-long term fluctuation, currency imbalance and market problems. This may pose a risk of adversely affecting the decision-making mechanisms of investors.

Policy and Governance: This involves the regulatory framework, policies, and decision-making processes that guide the city's actions. Systemic barriers may include conflicting policies, lack of coordination among different government bodies, and insufficient enforcement mechanisms. Policy Inconsistencies: Existing policies may lack clear and consistent incentives for adopting renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices.

Regulation in Türkiye can be made in the short term, not the medium or long term. This situation may create the risk of not being able to foresee the future while making long-term project planning.

Renewable energy facility institutions may take a long time to obtain the required license. Registration requirements may need to be restructured in parallel with our target in order for Izmir to realize the climate transformation it needs. There might be a risk of needing new legislation in the field of renewable energy.

Social and Cultural Systems: These encompass the behaviours, attitudes, and values of the city's inhabitants. Systemic barriers might include resistance to change, lack of awareness or understanding of climate issues, and social inequalities that affect access to sustainable resources and services. Lack of Public Awareness: Limited understanding of climate change issues among residents can hinder the adoption of sustainable behaviours and initiatives. Also, the resulting poverty has changed people's priorities. Clean energy and environmental awareness carry the risk that basic needs will be left behind. For this reason, there may be a possibility that the Eco sociological transformation is not sufficiently embraced by the citizens of Izmir. Communities in a state of inequality, also linked to poverty, may be at risk of not being included in the climate change efforts.

# Systemic Opportunities:

Renewable Energy Potential: İzmir's abundant solar and wind resources provide significant opportunities for expanding renewable energy generation. İzmir province is very rich in terms of wind energy with its theoretical capacity of 11,815 MW, and if the capacity factor is taken as 30%, the total amount of energy to be produced with this potential will be 31 billion kWh/year. This value is greater than the total electricity consumption of the Aegean region (~21 billion kWh in 2005).

In İzmir conditions, electrical energy that will meet the electricity needs of a family of 4 in an area of 25 m² can be produced with PV systems. With the decrease in costs, PV roof systems will become widespread rapidly.

It has been calculated that there is an apparent usable geothermal potential of 330,000,000 Kcal/h within the provincial borders of İzmir. While it is possible to heat an average of 80,000 houses with this amount of energy made visible, almost one-tenth of this amount can be heated. The apparent geothermal potential will increase by at least 5 times as a result of the research studies and drillings to be carried out in the existing geothermal areas within the province of İzmir.

Integrated Public Transportation: Investing in an efficient and well-connected public transportation system can reduce congestion and emissions.

Energy-Efficient Buildings: Implementing energy-efficient building codes and promoting retrofitting can reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

Circular Economy Initiatives: Enhancing waste separation, recycling programs, and composting can divert organic waste from landfills and promote resource efficiency. In order to set an example of a national industrial symbiosis model, the Industrial Symbiosis Program is carried out in İzmir in cooperation with the İzmir Development Agency and UNDP. They started an important initiative in İzmir by creating a digital-based governance platform that will bring businesses together to create industrial symbiosis relationships in İzmir.

They started an important initiative in Izmir by creating a digital-based governance platform that will bring businesses together to create industrial symbiosis relationships in Izmir.

Urban Greening: Creating more green spaces, parks, and urban forests can enhance biodiversity, improve air quality, and provide carbon sequestration. In İzmir's Strategy for Living in Harmony with Nature, important initiatives and policies have been established for solutions compatible with nature, such as Living Parks, İzmir Heritage Routes, which bridge the gap between urban and rural areas and aim to protect biodiversity.

Smart City Solutions: Utilizing smart technologies for energy management, waste reduction, and urban planning can optimize resource use and emissions.

Community Engagement: Educating and engaging residents in climate action through awareness campaigns, workshops, and incentives can drive behaviour change.

Local Partnerships: Collaborating with local businesses, universities, and NGOs can foster innovation and support the implementation of sustainable projects.

Policy Alignment: Aligning local policies with national and EU-level climate goals can create a supportive regulatory environment for climate neutrality.

Green Jobs Creation: The transition to a climate-neutral city can stimulate economic growth by creating new job opportunities in renewable energy, green technologies, and sustainable services.

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

As one of the 112 Mission cities selected for the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, Izmir has established the Global Climate Community Izmir to coordinate the efforts carried out within the Mission.

This community aims to collectively overcome the challenges of transitioning Izmir towards a climate-neutral future and create the broadest network of national and international supporters.

We seek to progress with a participatory roadmap towards the net-zero target by bringing together action plans prepared under various sectors and initiatives.

Izmir's climate community aligns its activities with the European Commission's Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, in collaboration with the Mission Platform NetZeroCities.

Our initiative in Izmir strives to address citizen concerns while fostering innovation from various sectors and disciplines. Therefore, throughout the process, we uphold a transparent approach based on legitimate information.

To realize the targeted urban alliance, the governance model includes public, private sector and non-governmental organizations, chambers of profession and industry and commerce, media organizations and financial institutions.

Apart from executing the actions determined by the comprehensive and participatory roadmap; invites the city's citizens, artists, prominent figures, small/large private businesses, and other centres to expand the city alliance with the goal of a climate neutral city.

The selection of Izmir as one of the 60 CrAFt Cities has created an important opportunity for the climate neutral journey to progress, including artists, young people, and disadvantaged groups, without leaving anyone behind. It is aimed to spread the city alliance to a wider area with the activities and experiences to be carried out within the scope of CrAFt Cities.

There are 3 basic structures in the Global Climate Community Izmir governance model. These are the Steering Committee Coordination Office and Working Groups.

# Steering Committee

It is the most representative advisory and support body of Izmir's Mission Platform.

It is envisaged that Izmir's high-level administration and public institutions, chambers of industry and commerce, associations, unions, non-governmental organizations and private sector representatives will take part in the board.

The Steering Committee will represent the development and implementation of the Mission strategies in coordination with the EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Platform.

|   |  Develop Izmir bioeconomy strategy and action plan. | It has become mandatory to make a transition from a structure based on unsustainable fossil resources to a bio-based economic system aiming to produce innovative and reliable products through the use of biobased resources. Efforts should be spent on the provision of biomass supply for bio-based products and services, diversification of biomass resources, fostering their production and ensuring sustainable provision in the fields of agriculture and forestry. Izmir has the potential to take important steps particularly towards transition to sustainable and nature-based agricultural practices, blue bioeconomy and forest bioeconomy in mountain ecosystems.  |
|  Energy Systems | Undertake a public lighting replacement scheme for all poles owned / run by municipality by installing LEDs. | Street lighting accounts for 4% of IMM's CO2e emissions, equivalent to roughly 0.13% of total emissions for Izmir. When other street lighting* is added it is 0.8% of the total emissions. Studies indicate that replacing conventional bulbs with LEDs can reduce energy consumption for lighting by around 80% and lower operational costs, lower maintenance, longer lifetime of the system. The payback period usually is much less than other energy efficiency measures. There are other advantages of LED street lighting. The high quality of light is safer for vehicle drivers, cyclists, pedestrians. There are no toxic substances such as mercury, it is not hazardous as waste. More saving can be achieved by controlling illumination of certain areas (dimming lighting when unused) *Within the responsibility of district municipalities, Ministry of Transportation or Highways management  |
|   |  Encourage the fuel switch from coal to more renewable sources in residential areas | 2 % of total emissions and 22 % of fuel combustion emissions in residential buildings is from coal. Coal use has negative effects on public health as well as being the dirtiest fuel in all aspects. It is important to provide an environment for coal users to switch to cleaner resources. There is a process of urban transformation applied through the “Law No 6306 Transformation of Areas under Disaster Risk”. Some of the residential buildings using coal as a fuel are also located in the planned Transformation Areas. Although at present it is more common to switch from coal to the use of natural gas, in order to achieve deeper decarbonisation, it will be necessary to switch away from fossil fuels and facilitate use of low and zero carbon energy technologies.  |
|  Mobility & transport | Promote a step change in the uptake of privately /commercially owned low emission vehicles: | This action will help Izmir take advantage from being at the forefront of the transition to electrified mobility through measures to that support electric vehicle use including: • priority parking for electric vehicles; • the provision of new and smart electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure; • To promote and encourage commercial buildings to have EV charging stations, with business licences granted by IMM. • Install EV charging stations for all municipal buildings and municipal parking area • Introduction of an all-electric / hybrid car club pool  |

|   |   | which help monitor, control, optimize, and operate traffic in urban areas.The streamed live data into the Transportation Management Centers allow transport officials and citizens to receive real-time updates about the city's transport conditions and availability.In Izmir, traffic flow and density can be monitored by the online platform of Izmir Transportation Center (IZUM) since 2018. The most important benefit of the system is the use of road capacities at high efficiency, a safer vehicle and pedestrian traffic, shortening travel times, and reduced accumulation and waiting times at the intersections. Currently, Izmir citizens can download the free application "IZUM" to smart devices. A summary of the system can be found at the beginning of the section. Although the system is in operation since 2018 Izmir wants to place more devices and enhance the system continuously.  |
|   |  Eco driving training (driving more economically) for IMM employees (As per SEAP Action - in lieu of EV/hybrid vehicles) | The studies by transport experts indicates that there is a potential to decrease consumptions by eco driving trainings. ECOWILL project of EU conducted studies and found the positive effects of eco-driving as follows. • Average decrease in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 5-15% • Reduced noise (due to lower revs) • Positive effects on traffic safety: up to 40% fewer accidents • Lower maintenance costs (e.g., brakes, tyres) • Increase in comfort (fewer shifting gears, less braking, less stress) • Contributes to EU CO2 emission targets Training will be provided to drivers for the use of public transportation, vehicles with different driving experience and fuel consumption.  |
|  Municipal Fleet and Service Vehicles: Electric and Low carbon vehicles | This action can be split into two parts, renewal of IMM's bus fleet by purchasing e-buses and the procurement of low carbon service vehicles. a) E-Buses purchase: IMM will continue and expand its efforts to replace old municipal buses and expand its existing capacity with e-buses. This action builds upon the ESHOT Strategic Plan, which has an expectation of approximately 400 e-buses to be purchased by 2024. Currently, 20 e-buses have already been purchased from a local producer in 2017 at a cost of 400,000 EUR per bus, with a further 380 to be procured. After operating e-buses for 3 years, it has been observed by ESHOT that despite e-buses having a greater upfront cost of 250,000 EUR compared to diesel buses, they are 78% cheaper to fuel and 40% cheaper to maintain over the life cycle of the vehicle. Taking into consideration the renewal of older vehicles and projections for future capacity needed, ESHOT have planned the need to replace 871 buses in 2020-2025 and 530 buses between 2025 – 2030, totalling a need for 1,401 new buses to be purchased by 2030. As the first step of this renewal process, ESHOT will purchase 304 diesel buses in 2021. The remaining 1097 buses will be purchased as e-buses. b) Service Vehicle procurement: IMM currently tender the provision of service vehicles, which are predominantly made up of fossil-fuel based vehicles: petrol & diesel. According to IMM's Activity Report of 2018, IMM owns 120 passenger cars, 197 carry all trucks and cargo carrier vehicles, 9 land vehicles and 553 special purpose vehicles. In addition, IMM rented 235 vehicles (Passenger and van), 1.801 minibuses and buses, 12  |   |

IMM will also develop a PR strategy (e.g. press releases and guidance) to promote CE assessments as a best practice measure that should be adopted by private businesses.  |
|   |  Partner and / or cooperate with relevant institutions and organisations that can act jointly in line with Zero Waste Regulation to develop and invest in the necessary recycling infrastructures (bins, trucks, routes etc.). | This action would focus on investing in and developing the necessary smart waste collection infrastructure and assets that IMM requires to help advance the Izmir Integrated Solid Waste Management Plan 2018. The amount of solid waste per capita in Izmir has increased in recent years, rising from 390.55 kg per capita in 2008, 469.09 kg per capita in 2018 – a 20% increase. According to the (Izmir Province Integrated Waste Management Plan, the amount of waste per capita is expected to continue to rise in the next decade (p.99). In 2018, 4800 tons of waste was accepted per day in Harmandali Solid Waste Storage Area. The amount of urban solid waste is expected to be 5,413 tons in 2025. This action is therefore necessary to minimise the increase in waste, and associated GHG emissions. There should be a focus on both expanding capacities to ensure that 100% of areas within the province receive a weekly collection, whilst also upgrading to a smart waste management system. The first stage of this action would involve filling the current data gaps regarding the current number of waste collection trucks and the district through Izmir that would require more extensive collection coverage.  |
|   |  Development of a detailed analysis (number, type, size, age etc) and action plan for the development and low-emission management of dumpsites / landfills (both closed and operational). This could incorporate the development of mandatory energy recovery and landfill gas and anaerobic digestion. | When the necessary investments and preparations are completed, the emission of a large amount of methane into the atmosphere will be prevented.  |
|   |  Investigate potential to provide dedicated waste collection for restaurant / food industry traders in-line with management infrastructure and technology. | There are a number of actions identified during studies and workshops that support “Zero Waste Regulation” and the efforts to reduce waste. All these actions are collected under one action. It is important to take action to reduce waste production in many ways. In case of a deviation from projections and a higher increase would lead to new investments needs for waste management. By preventing waste increase these investment need can be eliminated as well as lower GHG emissions.

|  Green infrastructure & nature-based solutions | Support the implementation of low carbon farming techniques and climate-smart agriculture across the province. | Development of resources and training scheme for farmers to support the transition to more sustainable agriculture that is more resilient to climate change, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration rates. This would include the consideration of techniques that help address the "five pillars" of carbon farming. These are nutrient management, livestock management, soil and grassland management, renewable energy, ancient production basins.  |
|  Green Industry | Implement an environmental labelling scheme for companies within Izmir. | This action involves implementing a company-level environmental labelling scheme (and associated marketing strategy) to raise consumer awareness of sustainability issues and promote environmentally responsible production and purchasing decisions. The aim would be to encourage industrial businesses to participate in clean energy and green infrastructure efforts.  |
|  Built environment | Revise planning regulations and guidelines to ensure efficient water fittings in all new municipality buildings. | This action would involve collaboration with relevant bodies to review and update the appropriate planning regulation and guidelines to ensure that water efficient fixtures and fittings are considered in all new public buildings. This would involve considering the following water-consuming components: WC's, Urinals, taps (wash-hand basins and, where specified kitchen taps and water disposal unit), showers, baths, dishwashers and washing machines  |
|   |  Municipality to develop policy that commits to net zero in all new municipality buildings by 2030. | In order to adapt to climate change and its impacts, IMM will commit to net zero in all new municipality-controlled buildings and encourage other organisations, businesses and institutions to do the same.  |
|   |  Insulation of Tertiary Buildings | Electricity consumption accounts for more than 90% of the total energy consumption of the tertiary sector, and therefore represents a major source of emissions. Insulation and energy efficient lighting installations will help to reduce these emissions as well as offering co benefits such as lower costs for businesses and other tertiary organisations. Mechanical and HVAC systems need to be considered for the efficiency of the systems.  |
|   |  Energy Efficiency in Municipal Buildings | A Presidential Circular to achieve energy efficiency of 15% in all public buildings by 2023 have been published recently. The regulations also enforce to make energy audits and assignment of energy managers to buildings with a conditioned area of over 10.000 m2. Compared to the energy consumption of the buildings in the city, the municipal consumptions are relatively low with a 1.4% of all emissions. Taking measures for efficiency would have an environmental impact as well as financial for the Municipality. Financial savings would also help to finance other low carbon actions. When analysed more than 60% of the electricity emissions are from water pumps, wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment facilities. There are ongoing efforts to save energy by IZSU.  |

| --- | --- |
|  Strategic Plan Objectives: | Planned, Safe and Sound Settlement Areas Will be Developed or Regenerated.  |
|  Description | Establish a source of funding / subsidy for retrofitting existing privately-owned residential properties so that they become more energy efficient. Eligible retrofitting works could include, for instance, upgrading the building fabric (e.g., wall and roof insulation, windows, airtightness, etc.) or services (e.g., heating systems and water/sanitary fittings). This action will include the formation of associated administrative and oversight bodies as required to target and deliver any funding. It should be coordinated with Action B1. 11, which includes research and surveys aimed at assessing the existing energy performance of the building stock, in order to target areas currently exhibiting poor performance.  |
|  Rationale / Purpose | Planning regulations and building performance standards dictate the energy efficiency of buildings, which can help to reduce emissions (i.e., climate mitigation), as well as ensuring that buildings are better able to adapt to climate change. Given that buildings represent a key source of emissions in Izmir (roughly 42% as of 2018), and also have a significant impact on climate resilience (for instance, due to their impact on overheating, urban heat islands and flood risk), it is important to ensure that best practices are implemented wherever possible through strong policies and guidance. This has cross-cutting impacts on public health, quality of life and cost of living and would follow the identification of ‘high-risk buildings’ under Law No 6306.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | 1. Establish a working group to review local level policies.
Conduct a study on energy efficiency design and materials to use taking into consideration future climatic conditions changing climate conditions and flexibility and adaptability in future use.
Engage District Municipalities that are important partners as they are the authority to grant license to new buildings.
Develop new planning regulations and guidelines for more energy efficient areas.

|  Strategic Plan Objectives: | Planned, Safe and Sound Settlement Areas Will Be Developed or Regenerated  |
| --- | --- |
|  Description | Explore the options that are available to support retrofitting of existing privately-owned residential properties so that they become more sustainable. Retrofitting practices could include but are not limited to.

• upgrading the building fabric (e.g., wall and roof insulation, windows, airtightness, etc.)
• services (e.g., heating systems and water/sanitary fittings),
• green roofs
• Water efficiency, rainwater/greywater collection for reuse and rehabilitation.

Options to support retrofitting could include:
• Adjusting permitting requirements for buildings that meet high standards of energy and water efficiency (e.g., fast-tracking permits, allowing greater floor area, etc.)
• Developing public awareness campaigns and information schemes to promote uptake in residential retrofitting.

This action should be coordinated with Action 1 (on top), which includes research and surveys aimed at assessing the existing energy performance of the building stock, in order to target areas currently exhibiting poor performance.  |
|  Rationale | Due to the age of the building stock of Izmir (46% having been built prior to 1990 and therefore prior to the introduction of thermal standards) there is likely to be poor building performance across the City, although there is currently no reliable data about the existing building stock in regard to age, household composition, heating systems, energy performance, etc. The energy efficiency and quality of housing stock not only dictates the emissions and cost associated with space heating and cooling, but if poor, it can expose the residents to a higher level of risk to extreme temperatures due to its heightened sensitivity to overheating. Furthermore, opportunities for improving the efficiency of water fixtures and fittings will help to reduce water demands and help remove dated plumbing (often cited as a reason for residents not drinking from the potable water network with dependency on bottled water).

By retrofitting residential buildings, operational energy costs can be reduced, decreasing the resident’s vulnerability to overheating, improve water efficiency and quality to reduce water stress and help to reduce GHG emissions.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | 1. Undertake analysis of housing stock to identify those areas that are poorly performing, not set for urban transformation and where improvement would reduce energy poverty.
Create a suite of home energy retrofit options that target the most cost-effective carbon reduction and water efficiency opportunities.
Conduct Life Cycle analysis for green energy standards proposed to further investigate how buildings should be designed, constructed/retrofitted and operated.
Establish guidelines that address the definitions, technical standards, economic analysis, building envelope recommendations, and building mechanical and electrical systems.
Developing public awareness campaigns or incentive methods to contribute to household budgets, through tax reductions such as Energy Performance Regulation in Buildings (05.12.2008) on energy gains to be achieved and environmental protection  |
|  Type of action | Policy / Behavioral / Training  |
|  Field of action | Built environment  |
|  Systemic lever | Governance and Policy / Learning and Capabilities  |
|  Potential Emission Savings | The emissions savings depend on the nature of the incentive that is established. For context, if this was delivered for 50% of residential buildings in Izmir, achieving a 10% reduction in electricity demand and a 40% reduction in heat demand.  |

|  Rationale | As Izmir has grown, so has the number of private vehicles on the roads from 477,773 in 2008 to 765,657 in 2018. This has led to reduced air quality and congestion. This action will help reduce dependence on fossil fuel private vehicles by offering a range of local and longer distance, low carbon, mobility options. Damage and disruption to transport infrastructure is also a key factor in amplifying the impact of a climate related event, especially in densely populated cities such as Izmir. By diversifying and improving the transport infrastructure within the City it will create an overarching transport infrastructure that can provide more effective protection and support recovery.  |   |

|  Strategic Plan Objectives: | Access to Reliable, Sustainable and Affordable Energy by Everyone Will be Promoted  |
| --- | --- |
|  Description | Undertake an options study to understand the feasibility of deploying local renewable energy technologies and expanding the use of renewable electricity. This should be done across Izmir, but opportunities may exist in areas in the city that are close to high energy users (for example, heat networks near universities, hospitals or industrial zones and / or cooling networks for offices) and in informal settlement areas where there is limited access to grid electricity.  |
|  Rationale | This action is a first step to rolling out renewable electricity technologies across the province, which would improve the security and reliability of Izmir's energy supply and reduce the carbon intensity of electricity use.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | Appoint a project team to conduct the analysis (e.g., consultants and/or different IMM departments)
Project team to investigate feasibility of technologies such as wind, solar PV / solar hot water, heat pumps, batteries, district heating, micro-CHPs and fuel cells, identifying suitable pilot projects.

|  Strategic Plan Objectives: | Access to reliable, sustainable and affordable energy by everyone will be promoted  |
|  Description | Investments for 15 MW solar energy in buildings owned by municipalities and their subsidiaries by 2030.  |
|  Rationale / Purpose | Izmir already had plans to invest in solar energy with the motivation to be a good example for its citizens. Increasing energy prices is another motivation for IMM to save and use the excess resources to promote other types of low carbon technologies in the city, especially technologies related to its own operations. With the rapid increase in exchange rates, the prices have inflated significantly in the previous years. Within the IMM strategic plan (2020-2024) there are 10 solar energy plants planned until the end of 2024.
There are 4 different solar energy investments planned with a total of 0.2 MW capacity within the short term. We can easily assume that IMM will develop more projects after the year 2024. By increasing the municipality's renewable energy generation capacity, it diversifies the energy supply, reducing the exposure of the municipality buildings and key infrastructure to the risk of power shortages and blackouts as a result of a climate hazard.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | Most of the implementation steps mentioned below are in progress especially on the agenda of Directorate of Climate Change and Clean Energy Department.
Analysis of legislations and potential of buildings, lands, bus stops etc
Analysis of possible financing methods; revenue sharing, unlicensed energy production rights of municipalities, public and private collaboration  |

| --- | --- |
|  Description | Development of resources and training schemes for farmers to support the transition to more sustainable agriculture that is more resilient to climate change, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and increases carbon sequestration rates. This would include the consideration of techniques that help address the “five pillars” of carbon farming. These are:
Nutrient Management: which looks at ways to improve storage and application of fertilizers and manures, which would increase efficiency and decrease emissions.
Livestock Management: A focus on animal health and welfare to reduce fatalities and stimulate healthy gut activity, exploring different grass types and supplements.
Soil and Grassland Management: Looking at soil biology including micro-organisms and Earthworks. Avoiding soil disturbance as much as possible and adopted practices such as injection fertilizers, and extended leys.
Renewable Energy: opportunity to diversify and consider using solar power and other renewable energies to generate electricity and sell the surplus back to the grid.
Ancient Production Basins: Agricultural production basins where low-carbona and rain-based production takes place, biodiversity is rich, and production is mostly based on pure (ancestry) seed crops.  |
|  Rationale | In order to improve food security while also reducing food waste globally and to mitigate negative climate change impacts.
CO2e emissions from livestock are one of the highest emissions of the city. According to the 2018 baseline emissions inventory undertaken by Izmir’s SECAP, there are nearly 750 thousand livestock within the city of Izmir accounting for 90% of the CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation. 937 thousand sheep and goats account for 7% of the enteric fermentation.
The use of chemical fertilizers is 8% of the total agriculture related emissions (2.06 million tCO2e), which equates to 1.2% of all emissions within the province.  |

|   | The EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (consolidated version) requires all new buildings to be nearly zero-energy by the end of 2020. Considering that Türkiye is a candidate country, Izmir would be a template for the rest of the country. Note: There are 8 buildings planned within the 2020-2024 Strategic Plan of IMM. IMM is encouraged to adopt this target for all future buildings, including those in the 2020-2024 IMM Strategic Plan where feasible.  |   |

|   | be to identify opportunities to retain and reuse materials of buildings and develop a design and management strategy for ensuring that the building is easy to maintain, adapt and deconstruct in future. IMM should determine the content and scope of such studies, but key outputs are likely to include: • A pre-demolition audit (if applicable) highlights reuse opportunity. • An estimate of construction, demolition and excavation waste arising, with specific commitments (e.g., design strategies) for how these will be minimized and monitored. • Specific design measures aimed at facilitating deconstruction and reuse. IMM will also develop a PR strategy (e.g., press releases and guidance) to promote CE assessments as a best practice measure that should be adopted by private businesses.  |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Rationale | Building construction, retrofit and demolition creates significant volumes of waste and in addition results in significant emissions from the manufacturing and construction process. Undertaking CE assessments will help to identify opportunities for reusing and recycling building materials, reducing the volume of waste to landfill and the need for virgin materials with associated extraction and processing impacts. IMM has greatest control over their own building stock, and the IMM Strategic Plan identifies several new buildings and retrofit plan. With significant private sector development, particularly within the allocated ‘Urban Transformation Areas’, this action will also encourage the private sector to also undertake CE assessments.  |   |
|  Steps for Implementation | 1. IMM must define the scope and process for carrying out CE assessments. This will include defining standards and design evidence requirements for pre-demolition audits, the method for estimating and monitoring waste arising, and the level of detail required for any design for deconstruction strategy. 2. Based on the outputs of (1), develop and disseminate guidance on how to carry out a CE assessment, both internally within IMM and externally so that private companies can develop their own targets as appropriate. 3. Allocate the individual(s) or department(s) responsible for ensuring they are carried out on IMM projects, e.g., ensuring that design teams have engaged with contractors to identify CE measures and ensure these are written into specifications or contracts in collaboration with IMM project decision makers. 4. Publicize positive outcomes (e.g., waste reduction and cost savings) through press releases and social media to promote uptake by private businesses  |   |

| --- | --- |
|  Strategic Plan Objectives: | A Sustainable Urban Infrastructure Will Be Built to Contribute to the Urban Economy  |
|  Rationale / Purpose | Electricity consumption accounts for more than 90% of the total energy consumption of the tertiary sector, and therefore represents a major source of emissions. Insulation and energy efficient lighting installations will help to reduce these emissions, as well as offering co-benefits such as lower fuel costs for businesses and other tertiary organizations. Mechanical and HVAC systems need to be considered for the efficiency of the systems.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | 1. Develop a working group with sector representatives, NGOs, financial institutions. 2. Cooperate with relevant stakeholders. 3. Study on incentive alternatives within the jurisdiction of the local governments 4. Examine the awareness level of SMEs, owners of tertiary buildings. 5. Build a communication strategy to increase awareness of energy efficiency, highly efficient appliance uses and behavioral change of the business owners. Note: Tertiary buildings tend to have higher energy demands as well as higher energy prices when compared with the residential or industrial sectors. This means that energy efficiency measures in tertiary buildings may have a shorter payback period which may help to promote uptake of these measures.  |
|  Field of action | Built environment  |
|  Systemic lever | Governance and Policy  |
|  Potential Emission Reductions | Due to the difficulty in determining the number and size It is not easy to make assumptions about the number or size of the tertiary buildings pool, several assumptions based on as in separate residential units. The assumptions are made considering the total energy consumption of the sector. It is assumed that 40% reduction in all fuel and 35% reduction in electricity consumption. 1.066.962 tCO2e reductions in 2030 378.126 tCO2e reductions in 2030 by awareness campaigns. Additionally, 5,431,447.5 tCO2e is addressed for this Action Plan related to energy saving, building retrofit for industrial buildings including insulation, district heating & cooling and lighting.  |

|  Strategic Plan Objectives: | A Sustainable Urban Infrastructure Will Be Built to Contribute to the Urban Economy  |
|  Rationale / Purpose | A Presidential Circular to achieve energy efficiency of 15% in all public buildings by 2023 have been published recently. The regulations also enforce to make energy audits and assignment of energy managers to buildings with a conditioned area of over 10.000 m². Compared to the energy consumption of the buildings in the city, the municipal consumptions are relatively low with a 1.4% of all emissions. Taking measures for efficiency would have an environmental impact as well as financial for the Municipality. Financial savings would also help to finance other low carbon actions. When analysed more than 60% of the electricity emissions are from water pumps, wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment facilities. There are ongoing efforts to save energy by IZSU. Still IMM has more than 150 buildings/facilities for different purposes of use and with different sizes. When the facilities of affiliates are included, the number is much higher.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | 1. Create an interdisciplinary project team and establish rules for investment decisions. 2. Prepare feasibility studies for energy efficiency measures prioritizing buildings/facilities with high consumptions. 3. Search for financing options for different actions (ESCOs or similar financing mechanisms can also be considered as an option) 4. Conduct pilot projects  |

| --- | --- |
|  Rationale / Purpose | The total fuel consumption in residential buildings account for 60% of the emissions in the building sector. Any change will have an important impact on the CO2e emissions of the city. Due to geographical and climate conditions of Izmir, cooling requirements of buildings are as significant as heating requirements. Thermal insulation will reduce cooling consumption as well as heating need. Natural gas is the most common heating source for the city and is used within almost half of households. The remainder of households still predominantly use either fuel-oil, coal, LPG or electricity for heating.  |

|   | In Izmir, traffic flow and density can be monitored by the online platform of Izmir Transportation Center (IZUM) from 2018. The most important benefit of the system is the use of road capacities at high efficiency, a safer vehicle and pedestrian traffic, shortening travel times, and reduced accumulation and waiting times at the intersections. Currently, Izmir citizens can download the free application "IZUM" to smart devices. A summary of the system can be found at the beginning of the section. Although the system is in operation since 2018 Izmir wants to place more devices and enhance the system continuously.  |

|  Rationale / Purpose | The studies by transport experts indicate that there is a potential to decrease consumption by eco driving training. The ECOWILL project of the EU conducted studies and found the positive effects of eco-driving as follows.
Average decrease in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 5-15%
Reduced noise (due to lower revs)
Positive effects on traffic safety: up to 40% fewer accidents
Lower maintenance costs (e.g., brakes, tires)
Increase in comfort (fewer shifting gears, less braking, less stress)
Contributes to EU CO2 emission targets.
Training will be provided to drivers for the use of public transportation, vehicles with different driving experience and fuel consumption.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | Intelligent Energy Europe Program of EU indicates 5-10% less fuel consumption of participants of Eco driving courses.
Study with experts to compile updated “Eco-driving tips.”
Determine different levels and lengths of education schemes (long versions for new drivers, shorter for experienced)
Set quality standards for the trainings.

|  Strategic Plan Objectives | A Sustainable Transport System Will Be Created with a Harmonious Interaction Between Different Modes of Transport, Offering Different Options
Access to Reliable, Sustainable and Affordable Energy by Everyone Will be Promoted  |
| --- | --- |
|  Description | This action can be split into two parts, renewal of IMM's bus fleet by purchasing e-buses and the procurement of low carbon service vehicles.

a. E-Buses purchase:
IMM will continue and expand its efforts to replace old municipal buses and expand its existing capacity with e-buses. This action builds upon the ESHOT Strategic Plan, which has an expectation of approximately 400 e-buses to be purchased by 2024. Currently, 20 e-buses have already been purchased from a local producer in 2017 at a cost of 400,000 EUR per bus, with a further 380 to be procured. After operating e-buses for 3 years, it has been observed by ESHOT that despite e-buses having a greater upfront cost of 250,000 EUR compared to diesel buses, they are 78% cheaper to fuel and 40% cheaper to maintain over the life cycle of the vehicle.

Taking into consideration the renewal of older vehicles and projections for future capacity needed, ESHOT have planned the need to replace 871 buses in 2020-2025 and 530 buses between 2025 – 2030, totalling a need for 1,401 new buses to be purchased by 2030. As the first step of this renewal process, ESHOT will purchase 304 diesel buses in 2021. The remaining 1097 buses will be purchased as e-buses.

b. Service Vehicle procurement:
IMM currently tenders the provision of service vehicles, which are predominantly made up of fossil-fuel based vehicles: petrol & diesel. According to IMM's Activity Report of 2018, IMM owns 120 passenger cars, 197 carryall trucks and cargo carrier vehicles, 9 land vehicles and 553 special purpose vehicles. In addition, IMM rented 235 vehicles (Passenger and van), 1.801 minibuses and buses, 12 construction vehicles and 12 water tankers. This action aims to revise IMM's current procurement policy to encourage the provision of electric or low-carbon alternative vehicle types.  |
|  5. Quantitative targets: Training of at least 100 driving instructors and educating 40,000 learner and novice drivers starting with public transportation drivers.
Conducting at least 4000 Eco driving trainings per year till 2030.

) Promote a Step Change in the Uptake of Privately and Municipality Owned Low Emission Vehicles

|  Rationale | 53% of public transport is delivered by buses. Most of these are diesel fuelled, with relatively high operating costs, risks of oil price volatility and environmental concerns. The EU has set ambitious targets to reduce the number of fossil fuel vehicles should be reduced by 50% by 2030, and by 2050 all fossil fuel vehicles should be eliminated. The city has already purchased 20 electric buses. However, most of IMM’s fleet is old, inefficient and the comfort for passengers can be improved. A comprehensive upgrade program will be a key driver of modal shift, resulting in improved air quality, reduced noise levels and improved comfort.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Steps for Implementation | **E-Bus purchase:**
Establish annual targets for fleet replacement.
Engage with funders to determine finance options.
Identify new sites for charging buses and service vehicles, taking into consideration the space requirements, charging rates and grid capacity. This could include dedicated charging sites for many buses or en-route charging.
Prepare feasibility studies for PV for clean energy production to reduce emissions further.

|  Description | This action will help Izmir take advantage from being at the forefront of the transition to electrified mobility through measures to that support electric vehicle use including:
• priority parking for electric vehicles.
• the provision of new and smart electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure.
• To promote and encourage commercial buildings to have EV charging stations, with business licenses granted by IMM
• Install EV charging stations for all municipal buildings and municipal parking areas.
• Introduction of an all-electric / hybrid car club pool  |
|  Rationale | Emissions from fossil fuel degrade Izmir's air quality, which is significantly poorer in the city center, and contribute to climate change. EV have several advantages, including lower emissions, noise and vibration levels. The environmental impact of fossil fuel vehicles is leading to stricter EU emissions standards leading to several major automotive producers have announcing they will stop working on diesel engines and concentrate on hybrid and electrical vehicle engines in the first half of the next decade. A local brand of e-vehicle is under development. Mass production will start in the next 3-5 years. Furthermore, EVs typically have lower the operating costs of the municipal fleet over time, with generally lower maintenance costs, and EVs will not be dependent on the volatile prices of oil.

Promoting hybrid and electric vehicles in the city is also one of the actions planned in Izmir Transportation Master Plan (2019). Supporting the uptake of EVs will help improve Izmir's environment and benefit from being at the forefront of the transition.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | **Priority parking and EV charging infrastructure:**
Undertake mapping of dedicated parking areas and street parking
Develop provision standards for EV charging sites (including catchment / distribution density, charging capacity (speed), type of charging connections.
Identify spaces within municipal buildings, municipal parking areas and streets which have beneficial positioning / access that can be reserved for EVs.
Re-paint parking spaces and add install new signage.
Work with GDZ Electricity for a feasibility study to evaluate grid capacity for installation of charging infrastructure.
Monitor and enforce correct use of parking spaces.
Work with EV charging operators to fund, install and operate charge points. These could be connected to other municipal infrastructure such as lighting columns.
Work with private parking operators to encourage their support of priority parking for EVs and installation of charging infrastructure.
Develop policies for EV parking and charging within new development.
Stakeholder engagement consultations and public awareness campaigns for the use of EV's and Road Safety.
To promote and encourage commercial buildings to have EV charging stations through business licenses granted by IMM.

**Introduce EV / Hybrid vehicle car club:**
In conjunction with identifying EV priority parking, identify locations for positioning EVs to be used as part of a shared pool 'car club'. These could be specific locations on residential streets, or within development areas.
Set up carpool club sharing company or working with existing car club operators to provide EVs.

|  Description | Undertake mapping and associated baseline analysis to understand the number, distribution and fuel consumption of public sector and industrial buildings that currently use fossil fuel-based heating and understand the feasibility and potential benefits of connecting these to the geothermal heat network. Heat networks operate most efficiently when there is a high anchor load and therefore it is expected that the focus will initially be on large public sector or industrial buildings (or zones).  |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Rationale | Heat generation can result in high carbon emissions. Connecting high heat users to the existing geothermal heat network and/or delivering new heat network(s) could result in the provision of more efficient, lower carbon heat. As with other forms of decentralized energy systems, it also offers benefits in terms of resilience and security of energy supply. At present there is very limited data available regarding the prevalence of different fuels and heating systems in Izmir, due in part to the number of informal settlements. In order to realize the potential benefits of heat networks, it is first necessary to undertake feasibility work to understand the scale and spatial distribution of opportunities along with their potential benefits.  |   |
|  Steps for Implementation | 1. Create a project team from different departments and establish rules for investment decisions. 2. Undertake area-wide fuel consumption and heating demand analysis of existing buildings (in particular, large public sector or industrial buildings) to identify heat network opportunity areas followed by more detailed feasibility work for opportunities with the greatest potential in terms of energy / CO2 savings, cost effectiveness and deliverability. 3. Analysis of the geothermal network for capacity, sizing, and investment needs 4. IMM and stakeholders to agree on capital project opportunities that can be taken forward following results of the feasibility studies. Although it is out of the scope of this report to identify opportunity areas, we note that some of the existing buildings in the geothermal region include: Dokuz Eylül University Hospital Campus, Izmir Economics University, Balçova Municipality Sports Facilities, Narlidere Municipality  |   |

| --- | --- |
|  Strategic Plan Objectives: | Access to Reliable, Sustainable and Affordable Energy by Everyone Will be Promoted  |
|  Rationale / Purpose | 2 % of total emissions and 22 % of fuel combustion emissions in residential buildings is from coal. Coal use has negative effects on public health as well as being the dirtiest fuel in all aspects. It is important to provide an environment for coal users to switch to cleaner resources. There is a process of urban transformation applied through the “Law No 6306 Transformation of Areas under Disaster Risk”. Some of the residential buildings using coal as a fuel are also located in the planned Transformation Areas. Although at present it is more common to switch from coal to the use of natural gas, in order to achieve deeper decarbonization, it will be necessary to switch away from fossil fuels and facilitate use of low and zero carbon energy technologies.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | 1. Determination of coal-consuming residential areas and consumptions e.g., through surveys and GIS mapping 2. Determination of the conversion potential from coal to geothermal and/or electricity from renewable sources 3. Analyse expansion of natural gas infrastructure if other renewable sources are not available or feasible for the citizens. 4. Increase awareness among citizens using coal about the benefits of other energy sources including externalities.  |
|  Field of action | Energy systems  |
|  Systemic lever | Learning and Capabilities  |
|  Potential Emission Reductions | The emission reduction is calculated assuming 50% of coal consuming households switch to natural gas in order to be conservative on the calculations. The exact household number which is using coal is not known. However, the average heating demand is calculated as ~5,700 kWh/household. Based on this, it is calculated that over 210 thousand households are consuming coal for heating. 83,331 tCO2e reductions by 2030.  |

|   | energy consumption for lighting by around 80% and lower operational costs, lower maintenance, longer lifetime of the system. The payback period usually is much less than other energy efficiency measures.
There are other advantages of LED street lighting. The high quality of light is safer for vehicle drivers, cyclists, pedestrians.
There are no toxic substances such as mercury, it is not hazardous as waste.
More savings can be achieved by controlling illumination of certain areas (dimming lighting when unused)

|  Strategic Plan Objectives: | Access to Reliable, Sustainable and Affordable Energy by Everyone Will be Promoted  |
|  Description | This action involves implementing a company-level environmental labelling scheme (and associated marketing strategy) to raise consumer awareness of sustainability issues and promote environmentally responsible production and purchasing decisions. The aim would be to encourage industrial businesses to participate in clean energy and green infrastructure efforts.  |
|  Rationale | ‘Green’ labelling schemes include, for example, organic certification and fair-trade products, sustainable timber, or energy efficiency ratings for appliances. The aim is to help customers understand the environmental and social sustainability impacts of their decision-making and by extension promote responsible purchases. Some research suggests that green labelling schemes can directly increase the value of a product, which offers potential economic benefits to participating organizations, along with sustainability benefits.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | 1. Form a project team to assess opportunities to deploy labelling schemes, considering topics such as appropriate sectors, market trends and relevant legislation.
Once a suitable initiative is identified, develop a marketing campaign to (a) encourage businesses to participate in these efforts and (b) raise consumer awareness.  |

| --- | --- |
|  Strategic Plan Objectives: | Access to Reliable, Sustainable and Affordable Energy by Everyone Will be Promoted  |
|  Rationale / Purpose | Total electricity consumption related emissions are 30% of the total emissions. This consumption consists of residential, tertiary buildings, public lighting. It is absolutely essential to get the private sector on board to be able to reach the desired emission reduction targets.

After the latest legislative changes regarding grid connection fees, feed-in-tariff incentives introduced by the government have become ineffective. Although the procedures are eased step by step with legislation changes the incentives and feed-in-tariffs are no longer considered as incentives.

There are still some advantages implementing solar energy systems under the form of energy cooperatives which can easily be led by local government and NGOs.

When we look at the best practices of renewable energy penetration national incentives have been actively in the early stages then became a free market after certain thresholds. It is important to get central management on board for the uptake of renewables by citizens.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | 1. Create a project team from different departments to assess key renewable energy opportunities / locations within Izmir.
Study best practices of incentives, financial schemes from around the world
Prepare guidelines that will help citizens and business owners with the legislation and procedures.

|  Description: | Covers all kinds of industries and economic sectors producing, managing and distributing biological resources (e.g., Agriculture, Food, Forestry, Fishery and other bio-based industries).  |
|  Rationale | It has become mandatory to make a transition from a structure based on unsustainable fossil resources to a bio-based economic system aiming to produce innovative and reliable products using bio- based resources. Efforts should be spent on the provision of biomass supply for bio-based products and services, diversification of biomass resources, fostering their production and ensuring sustainable provision in the fields of agriculture and forestry. Izmir has the potential to take important steps particularly towards transition to sustainable and nature-based agricultural practices, blue bioeconomy, and forest bioeconomy in mountain ecosystems.  |
|  Steps for Implementation | 1. A meeting should be organized with the relevant public institutions, private sector institutions, universities, chambers, cooperatives, and associations in order to identify the areas of Izmir offering a bioeconomy potential, which will constitute the basis for the strategic plan of IMM.
IMM should appoint individual(s) or department(s) in charge who will ensure the conduct of the relevant strategy on the part of the administration.
The relevant bioeconomy strategy and action plan should be prepared, and services should be procured on the issue.
Strategy should be created, and the results obtained should be ensured to be shared widely through the strategy website, press releases and social media.
The action plan should be created via a dialogue conference in order to determine the internal officers of IMM and the relevant external institutions who are in charge of the implementation processes.
The structure founded at IMM for monitoring the relevant strategy and action plan (Item 2) should be authorized to perform the monitoring activities and be ensured to be competent in the relevant job.  |

|  Potential Emission Savings | The specific reduction associated with this action has not been calculated at this time, however emissions can be reduced as:
• Waste separation, minimization, reuse and recycling reduce GHG emissions by conserving raw materials and fossil fuel use during the products’ life cycle.
• Waste offers a significant source of renewable energy. Incineration and other thermal processes for waste-to-energy, landfill gas recovery and utilization, and use of anaerobic digester biogas can play important roles in reducing fossil fuel consumption and GHG emission.
• Increasing the material recovery rate and compost production reduces GHG emissions that are currently associated with their disposal in landfill.  |   |

|  Rationale / Purpose | This action would focus on investing in and developing the necessary smart waste collection infrastructure and assets that IMM requires to help advance the Izmir Integrated Solid Waste Management Plan 2018. It would be developed in-line with actions B-2.2.26 and B-2.2.29.

The amount of solid waste per capita in Izmir has increased in recent years, rising from 390.55 kg per capita in 2008, 469.09 kg per capita in 2018 – a 20% increase. According to the (Izmir Province Integrated Waste Management Plan, the amount of waste per capita is expected to continue to rise in the next decade (p.99).

In 2018, 4800 tons of waste was accepted per day in Harmandalı Solid Waste Storage Area. The amount of urban solid waste is expected to be 5,413 tons in 2025. This action is therefore necessary to minimize the increase in waste, and associated GHG emissions.

There should be a focus on both expanding capacities to ensure that 100% of areas within the province receive a weekly collection, whilst also upgrading to a smart waste management system. The first stage of this action would involve filling the current data gaps regarding the current number of waste collection trucks and the district through Izmir that would require more extensive collection coverage.

Developed in-line with the timeframes for the construction of disposal and recycling facilities, outlined in the Izmir Integrated Solid Waste Management Plan 2018  |

|  Steps for Implementation | Harmandal: Solid Waste Landfill Facility has already been rehabilitated and electricity generation has started at the end of 2019. The energy generation capacity is 15 MW and can be extended up to 45MW. The landfill area uses the energy generated within the site. Harmandal SWLF is operated by a private company under the control of our Municipality under Public Procurement Law No. 2886.

• It should be investigated if the Harmandal model is applicable to Bergama due to lower capacity there.
• Alternative investment models need to be investigated for Bergama landfill.
• Conduct studies on the 2 landfills to see the potential of rehabilitation.
• Since IMM now has necessary experience, the 5 open landfills will be turned into regulated landfills.  |

|  Potential Barriers | Lack of financial resources
Inapplicability due to low capacities of landfills other than Harmandal
Landfill gas decreases over time, eventually becoming a non-viable source of energy.
In line with the Waste Hierarchy, and in line with Circular Economy principles, waste should be significantly minimized (if not eliminated) over time, making it a sub-optimal energy source in the medium to long term  |

|  Strategic Plan Objectives: | Institutional Capacity and Functioning Will Be Made More Effective, Economic and Efficient  |
|  Description | In order to reduce the amount of non-recyclable waste and GHG emissions, Municipality will commit to banning the use of single-use plastics within their buildings and operations, while encouraging other organizations, businesses and institutions to do the same.  |
|  Rationale | According to the United Nations Environment Program report “Single-Use Plastics - A Roadmap for Sustainability”, the impacts of single-use plastics include:
• Impacts on wildlife from direct ingestion/entanglement or from ingestion of microplastics following plastic degradation.
• Blockage of watercourses and sewage systems.
• Visual impacts and dissemination from litter.
• Economic costs of beach and sea clean-up and economic impacts on fisheries, tourism and shipping industries.
• Plastic production and disposal generate GHG emissions, and the majority of plastics are not recycled.

IMM has direct control over municipal buildings. Banning the use of single-use plastics is a simple step to reduce Izmir’s total amount of non-recyclable waste and GHG emissions  |
|  Steps for Implementation | Municipality to commit to banning the use of single-use plastics:
Stakeholder mapping and confirmation of policy scope.
Inventory of single-use plastics
Identify potential alternatives and any essential/non-substitutable items.  |

|  Rationale / Purpose | There are several actions identified during studies and workshops that support “Zero Waste Regulation” and the efforts to reduce waste. All these actions are collected under one action.

It is important to take action to reduce waste production in many ways. In case of a deviation from projections and a higher increase would lead to new investments needs for waste management. By preventing waste increase these investment need can be eliminated as well as lower GHG emissions.

Undertaking awareness raising campaign’s and provide guidance / instruction on how citizens can embark on home or community composting (the recycling of organic wastes such as food and kitchen waste from households, restaurants, caterers), or other means of recyclable waste This will help to reach the objective of sustainable waste management and effective recycling with a view of encouraging and informing behaviour change.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

After the residual emissions are determined in the baseline greenhouse gas inventory, offsetting strategies for mitigation, removal and preserving processes will be drafted. The steps of this process are planned below:

A) Calculate Residual Emissions: Before you can offset emissions, you need to accurately calculate the number of residual emissions you want to offset. This involves measuring or estimating the emissions that remain after implementing all feasible emissions reduction measures.

B) Prioritize Reductions: First and foremost, focus on reducing emissions at the source as much as possible. Residual emissions should only be considered after all reasonable efforts to minimize emissions have been exhausted. This involves implementing energy efficiency measures, switching to renewable energy sources, improving operational processes, and more.

C) Identification of the areas where removal and preservation projects will be carried out: green and blue infrastructure improvements will become the main focus. The blue infrastructure will consist of stabilisation projects for the improvement of rivers, lakes, peatlands, wetlands and biodiversity conservation. Urban agriculture, mangrove, rain gardens, etc. will be evaluated in terms of green infrastructure.

D) Purchase Carbon Offsets: These can include reforestation projects, renewable energy projects, methane capture from landfills or agriculture, and more. Ensure that the offsets you purchase are independently verified and certified according to recognized standards like the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), VERRA or Gold Standard. In the near future, carbon emission trading legislation will be introduced in the domestic market in Türkiye. It will be possible to sell carbon credits while buying them.

E) Transparency and Reporting: Establish a system to transparently record our offsetting activities and emission reductions.

F) Ensuring Stakeholder Engagement: Involve employees, citizens and other key stakeholders in offsetting and emission reduction efforts.

G) Monitoring: Ensuring that emissions and the effectiveness of offsetting strategies are regularly measured.

# C-1.2: Description of organisation and governance interventions

Izmir is a city with strong capacity and experience in joint production processes in the fight against climate change. The coming together of all institutions and networks serving the climate neutral journey in Izmir at GCC Izmir creates an important opportunity to coordinate this strong capacity. The organizations in the GCC Izmir Steering Committee consist of representatives who have played an active role in the fight against climate change. It is aimed to coordinate all experiences regarding climate change in Izmir under the umbrella of GCC Izmir.

GCC Izmir aims to be a flexible model to make the participatory process sustainable while moving towards climate neutrality. It is shaped according to current needs within the framework of the principled attitude determined by the society regarding sustainability. In this context, it is possible to add new institutions and stakeholders and to implement the necessary changes in the governance structure over time.

GCC Izmir has 6 principles under 2 main headings: process design and output design.

Three process design principles ensure procedural quality:

Inclusiveness to bring together different actors and multiple types of knowledge on an equal basis
Openness to adopting, integrating and sharing knowledge
Legitimacy to ensure that the process contains legitimate and reliable information and is trusted by participants and wider urban actors.

Three output design principles indicate what types of results should be produced due to co-production:

Actionable information for policy and planning ensures that co-produced knowledge is immediately relevant and translated into policy and planning
Usable knowledge and empowerment ensure that co-produced knowledge outcomes are valuable to and adopted by many actors
Expanding institutions to provide synergy enables co-produced knowledge to be linked to multiple goals, strategies and agendas within the city. This helps create synergies across sectors.

Establishing trust, evaluating feedback and producing evidence-based information play an important role in the sustainability of society. It uses digital solutions to achieve this goal. GCC Izmir website is designed as the main communication tool of the community. As the Website becomes more dynamic over time, it is aimed to include online democratic participation tools for citizens and partners. At the same time, it is aimed to build trust and increase the courage to come together in line with common goals by transparently sharing the processes and outputs of the projects carried out within the scope of GCC Izmir.

Feedback mechanisms and learning processes play an important role in building trust. A transparent and participatory process with evidence-based information must be followed to enable meaningful learning and evaluation. The reflexive monitoring approach is an important point to support the learning and evaluation process at GCC Izmir. This approach for the transformative monitoring framework/dynamic learning agenda will be followed in 5 steps:

Planning reflective monitoring as an integral part of GCC Izmir from the beginning
Ensuring that all actors involved in the co-production are involved in the process.
A Secretary who can be coached for the role of reflexive monitor in the Working Groups is determined. The primary responsibility of the secretary is to guide the reflexive monitoring process. This is a challenging role as it requires certain skills, including the ability to balance. Drill into the big picture to facilitate meetings and sessions, synthesize large amounts of information, and ask important specific questions from those involved.
Evaluating the practices in the co-production journey using a timeline. This is done by regularly correlating the information obtained from the mirror tracking process with the delivery process.

Critical milestones are identified, relevant learning questions are formulated and tracked. Actions are determined in a way that reflects the work involved in GCC Izmir's climate neutral solutions.

Sticking to the method and taking the time to learn and adapt the practice.

Organizing surveys on all developments in the working groups regarding GCC Izmir's Climate Neutral solutions and sharing the lessons learned as a result of the surveys will be another step that facilitates the building of trust.

At the same time, it is planned that the working groups will meet every 2 weeks to determine, revise action plans and develop projects suitable for these actions.

The Steering Committee is planned to meet every 4 months to support the legitimacy of the prepared developments, their evaluation and dissemination to wider audiences. Determined meeting periods can be kept flexible according to current needs.

# C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

## THE CITTASLOW METROPOLIS IZMIR

İzmir, as the first Cittaslow Metropolis candidate city in the world since 2021, aims to adopt this philosophy on a larger scale. The project's objectives include ensuring a quality and attractive life through technology, promoting sustainable development that respects regional values, ensuring income justice, and preserving natural, cultural, and historical importance.

The Cittaslow Neighbourhood Program within this initiative focuses on achieving a social transformation aligned with the philosophy of slowness. Key features of this program include ensuring equal and fair access to basic needs, designing environments for all ages, promoting safe walking and biking paths, and optimising public spaces based on general needs. In the broader context, the Cittaslow Metropolis İzmir project aligns with climate neutrality goals by advocating for a slowed-down, sustainable approach to urban living, which can lead to reduced carbon emissions and a more environmentally friendly urban planning approach.

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

## Innovative Aspects:

Cittaslow Neighbourhood Program: A transformative approach promoting a slower-paced daily life, ensuring equal access to basic needs, and optimizing public spaces for community benefits.

Engagement Mechanisms: The initiative fosters community engagement through the 'Social Dialogue Team', which develops mechanisms to ensure residents' access to essential services and promotes their overall well-being. Integration of Global Urban Priorities: The project aligns global urban challenges with the Cittaslow philosophy, ensuring that urban solutions are both innovative and rooted in the core principles of the Cittaslow movement.

The Cittaslow Metropolis İzmir initiative is designed to transform the urban environment, benefiting both direct and indirect stakeholders. The direct beneficiaries are the residents of İzmir, who will experience improved quality of life by adopting the Cittaslow principles. This includes access to safe walking and biking paths, public spaces tailored to general needs, enhanced social interaction, support for local businesses, and preservation of local identity, culture, history, traditions, and nature. Indirectly, the project also benefits the broader community by fostering a culture of participation-oriented activities, promoting local employment opportunities, and encouraging volunteering and solidarity. In essence, the Cittaslow Metropolis İzmir initiative aims to create a harmonious urban environment that prioritizes the well-being of its inhabitants and the preservation of its cultural and natural heritage.

## Lessons to be Learned:

Collaborative Approach: The project underscores the importance of collaboration with international and local stakeholders, including civil society representatives, professional chambers, experts, and academics. Such a collective approach ensures a holistic understanding of urban challenges and the development of practical solutions. Data-Driven Decision Making: The project's partnership with the EKOKENT Research and Application Center of İzmir University of Economics emphasizes the importance of scientific methods and data-driven insights in urban planning.

## Planned Benefits:

Enhanced Urban Environment: The project aims to improve the quality of life by slowing down urban processes, ensuring access to essential goods and services, and optimizing public spaces for community benefits.

Addressing Environmental Concerns: The project seeks to tackle challenges like unhealthy nutrition, poverty, and air pollution by taking precautions to protect living spaces and nature. This inherently supports the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental co-benefits.

Strengthening Community Spirit: The project emphasizes the physical and mental health of society, maintaining community spirit and renewable energy use.

The Cittaslow Metropolis Izmir project provides a roadmap for cities to achieve a harmonious balance between urban development and environmental sustainability, focusing on community well-being and climate action.

# EMERGENCY SOLUTION TEAM

Emergency Solution Team institutionalized under the umbrella of the municipality; It created a business model that will work integrated with other units of the municipality in order to quickly solve the city's problems and to implement the work to be done systematically and quickly.

According to this model, Field researchers knock on all doors in the

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

neighbourhoods designated as the Emergency Solution Teamwork area, learn the expectations of each household regarding municipal services and analyse the problems. After this process, the report prepared for the neighbourhood was submitted to Izmir Metropolitan Municipality.

It is forwarded to the Presidency and Coordination Office. Then, the units go out into the field and identify the problems stated by the neighbourhood residents. In the final stage, a meeting is held with the units related to the decisions made and task distribution in the area under investigation and the foundations of the manufacturing process are laid.

The Emergency Solution team, which has been working in 6 districts since its establishment, has met with 20,408 households in 40 neighbourhoods to date.

The resolved issues cover almost all the services that a Metropolitan Municipality should provide from a social democratic perspective. The Emergency Solution Team, which serves all the needs of the people of Izmir, from road works to parks, from social assistance to sports fields, from disinfection to cleaning, from traffic regulations to demolition of abandoned buildings, from infrastructure works to landscaping, undertakes an important task to distribute the prosperity in Izmir equally to all neighbourhoods.

Functioning of the Emergency Solution Team; It is grouped under four main headings: "Strategy", "Discovery", "Planning" and "Execution".

The Emergency Solutions Office's key initiatives supporting the climate neutrality goal are shared below:

Using plants that require minimum water in the parks. For example, the plants used in Buca Fırat Living Park and Karabağlar Şehit Yahya Eflöglu Fruit Park are plants that require little irrigation. Plants such as quince, fig, mulberry, olive, almond tree or thyme and wild strawberry were preferred. In addition, solar lighting systems were installed in the parks.
Neighbourhood Gardens: Neighbourhood gardens have been created in the slums in the metropolis, within all the reinforced concrete structures. Agricultural production is carried out and residents of the neighbourhood are given training on agriculture, production and soil.
"A garden area was created in Kadifekale, the Emergency Solution Team working area, in order to increase agricultural activities in the city center and contribute to the family economy. Activities are organized with the participation of neighbourhood residents in this area, which strengthens the feelings of solidarity, neighbourhoods and success together and emphasizes the importance of agriculture. Neighbourhood Garden was a successful project. Mayor Tunç Soyer decided to expand the project throughout Izmir. Garden areas were also created in Buca Mustafa Kemal and Fırat Neighbourhoods. Field preparation studies were carried out in Bornova and Karabağlar districts. Efforts are being made to expand the establishment of gardens to every neighbourhood in the metropolis."
Public Transportation: Bus lines were added to neighbourhoods where there were no bus lines or arrangements were made on the routes. In this way, people can reach the places they want to go by choosing public transportation rather than using their personal vehicles.
Investments in Social or Sports Activities: Neighbourhood residents are directed to an active life. Within the borders of the neighbourhood, Sports facilities, walking paths are being built and free sports training is provided. Citizens who access social activities within the neighbourhood can spend time in touch with nature. With the influence of the recreation areas built, activities and places to spend time are increasing within the borders of the neighbourhood.

All work to be done within the scope of the Emergency Solution Team is determined with a participation-oriented approach. Investments are made to meet the needs of citizens with public

resources. Everyone decides on the investment to be made in their own neighbourhood. Thus, a participatory, democratic and accountable model is created. The usability of investments made in line with needs also increases to the same extent.

## GREEN TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM

According to the World Energy Outlook 2021 report, 770 million people still cannot access electricity and suffer from energy poverty. The Minister of Energy and Natural Resources announced that 3,365,784 electricity subscribers and 710,364 natural gas subscribers were processed due to the fact that they could not pay their debts in the 9-month period from January 2019 to September.

An energy efficiency program aiming existing residences and small workplaces with broad participation has not been executed in Türkiye yet.

An energy efficiency program is recommended for residential and Micro/Small businesses.

Within the scope of the proposed program, an energy efficiency technical help desk can be established, financing of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments can be facilitated, and energy poverty can be reduced.

The Green Transformation Program was planned to develop energy efficiency applications for Households / Residences (Package-1), Small Business (Package-2) and low-Income families (Package-3)

IZENERJI will work within an operational profit margin and use all its profits for disadvantage groups (Package-3).

Expected outcomes of the program are shared below:

Increase in Energy Efficiency with less energy consumption
Challenging Economic Crisis with Reduced Invoices
Reducing Greenhouse Gases with struggle with climate change
Social Impact with awareness and opportunity rise

## YOUTH SUSTAINABILITY AMBASSADORS PROGRAM

The Youth Sustainability Ambassadors Program is an initiative that aims to mobilize young people to train the human resources that the business world needs in the field of sustainability after the EU Green Deal and to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also called Agenda 2030. It aims to provide university graduate and postgraduate students with experience by participating in project-based applications in line with the SDGs, and to offer new career opportunities to create trained human resources for the sustainability departments of public and private sector organizations.

![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)

Our Youth Sustainability Ambassadors will produce projects that provide solutions to local problems from the perspective of the UN Global Goals. They will gain field experience through the internship opportunity offered to them and will begin to see sustainability as a new career field. Thanks to the training and internship program, young people who are provided with project-based internship opportunities in the sustainability offices of the private sector and local governments will have a new career opportunity as 'Sustainability Ambassador'.

# 1 Introduction

Transforming our cities into smart and climate neutral cities has become a more vital goal as we experience the increasing effects of climate change.

The most important reason for this is that most of the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions take place in cities in the world.

Another reason is that cities have access to more capital and know-how and have a much higher capacity of citizen participation and civil society that can create new ideas and concepts to find out innovative solutions to the climate change.

Therefore, cities must show their greatest ambitions to achieve their climate adaptation, mitigation plans, and net-zero targets to become climate-resilient cities.

As the people of Izmir, we know that while our living areas and future in danger, it is not an option but a necessity to change the current understanding and policies.

EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission offers cities a valuable opportunity to provide innovative and radical solutions to their climate neutrality goals. Cities with the willingness and ambition to work towards the climate neutral target have vital support to evaluate their current policies and plans, identify gaps in achieving the target and eliminate these gaps, ensure participation, reach a common network and technical operational and financial solutions.

The 3 elements of the Climate City Contract, which will be prepared by Mission Cities, consisting of the Action Plan, Investment Plan and Commitments, form a strong basis for following the cities' achievement of this goal.

Izmir continues its current work and perspective on climate change, hoping to lead the way in making the necessary changes in Türkiye and shed light on this vital global problem.

Izmir's current policies and practices towards climate change and its perspective encouraged it to take the next steps towards its climate neutrality goal and being aware of the innovative path offered by EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, Izmir decided to become one of the Mission Cities.

To briefly introduce Izmir and its perspective on climate action; Izmir is one of the historical cultural centres in the world where different cultures, lifestyles and beliefs have lived together for thousands of years. It is one of the most important historical and cultural port cities in the World, at Mediterranean. It is also one of the rare cities that can host many different sectors such as industry, tourism, trade and agriculture. In addition, due to being a historical port city, it has become an important export and industrial center.

Izmir is called the "Renewable Energy Capital" of Türkiye.

It is underlined that Izmir, which is the production base of wind turbine components in Türkiye, Izmir has the potential to be the leading city where wind turbine components are produced and exported from there. Izmir becomes prominent as the city that produces the most electricity from wind energy in Türkiye. Izmir is also the leading city in the production of wind power plant components. Izmir meets about 17 percent of the electricity produced from wind energy in Türkiye, employs over 7,500 people in the sector and provides an annual export of 500 million dollars, has all kinds of opportunities to become a global production center.
