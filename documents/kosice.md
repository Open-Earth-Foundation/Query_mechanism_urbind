# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CCC Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

In 2022, Košice was selected by the European Commission as one of 100 climate-neutral and smart cities. This membership represents another step in the city's so far short journey towards climate neutrality. The support from NetZeroCities, for which we are grateful, and the preparation of the Climate City Contract mean many opportunities for the city, which we are trying to translate into concrete actions.

During the preparation of the Climate City Contract, we identified many barriers that we sought interventions and partners to overcome. The preparation of the action plan started with informal and individual interviews with departments in the city office. It continued with briefings and discussions with local partners who see the issue as socially relevant. Efforts to involve government institutions in the process have not met with the response the City expected. However, at the local level, with each successive discussion, an ecosystem of partners began to form, out of which emerged clear support and a strong mandate for the City to build climate neutrality. This support is perceived by the City as a desired change that has committed the City to expanding its collaboration and current ecosystem of partners so that each is an advocate for building a climate neutral City to its other partners, customers, and residents.

The portfolio of interlinked interventions proposed in this action plan builds on the city's existing emissions data, with an emphasis on the sectors that are the largest GHG emitters (buildings, transport), existing collaborations, upcoming and new projects and activities that are needed to provide a pathway that will lead the city to the desired change.

In developing the pathway, the recommendations of the mission have been accepted within the scope of the city's current capacities and taking into account the readiness for such work. In order to work across the city and with all target groups, including vulnerable groups, all sectors, academic, private and third sector, were involved in the development of the action plan.

To accelerate the climate transformation, four main priorities have been defined (1. Energy efficiency and the transition to renewable energy, 2. sustainable mobility, 3. Sustainable urban development and 4. Progress through dialogue and cooperation), which will be implemented through 14 key activities. To strengthen the transition, changes in governance, working with citizens to raise awareness on climate change and delivering solutions through social innovation will be implemented simultaneously.

An important part of the effort to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions has been to see what it can do for us beyond these headline targets. For this reason, all of the proposed activities were also discussed in terms of additional benefits that go far beyond energy savings and emissions reductions - co-benefits that will promote energy independence for residents, financial savings, higher asset valuations, cleaner air, better quality public space, better health, and more, resulting in a better quality of life for residents in our city.

The design of the action plan has been influenced by the existence of many barriers (lack of dates, finance, time, competences, structural but also behavioural), which we perceive as present and which we believe will also be removed in the near future through the Climate City Contract, allowing us to meet all the objectives of the mission.

We see the emissions reduction target, which we are able to achieve under current conditions, as one of the milestones on the path to climate neutrality. We feel that participation in this EU Mission and the implementation of the Climate City Contract will create space for improvements beyond the current action plan. And it is this fact that will create a better starting point for any future update of the Action Plan and support for the city's ambition to achieve climate neutrality.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

Košice is the metropolis of Eastern Slovakia and with 229 040 inhabitants (2021), the second most populous city in Slovakia. With proximity to neighbouring countries (20 km to Hungary, 80 km to Poland, 90 km to Ukraine) the city is a natural regional social and cultural centre, as well as a centre for industry, business, and education (seats of three universities). The city plays a role in the East-West transport link, forming a connection between Eastern and Central Europe. The topography of the city is diverse. Its shape is formed by the Hornád river valley that it occupies. The hilly north is surrounded by massive city-owned municipal forests, while the south opens towards low-lying flatlands.

The development and growth of the city was steady for centuries, but since the early 1960s the city grew rapidly, from less than 100 000 inhabitants up to almost a quarter of a million in the late 1980s. A massive metallurgic plant (current US Steel) was built beyond the southern border of the city, and it was the main driving force behind the growth of the city, which was the fastest-growing city in the former Czechoslovakia. The present shape and form of the city is a result of urban planning from the second half of the 20th century - the old medieval town surrounded by a mixture of old and new industrial areas, massive collective housing estate areas and former villages, which were overgrown by the expanding central city and an infrastructure heavily favoring individual car transport.

The city started a new process of transformation in the early 2000s - from a heavy industry-dependent town into a more diverse and cleaner metropolis with a mix of services, culture and education supplementing the remaining heavy industry. The systematic decrease of workforce in heavy industries is substituted by a corresponding systematic increase of workforce in IT (10.000 employees), culture and creative and soft industries. This change in the local mindset was rewarded by achieving the prestigious title of European Capital of Culture in 2013 and becoming a member of Unesco Creative City of Media Arts in 2017. The innovation potential of Košice is also significant due to the presence of a strong academic and research environment, as well as the entrepreneurial background of international companies.

Another great opportunity for the city is the arrival of large investments, which create new job opportunities and emphasize sustainable development. One of the largest investments in Košice and its surroundings is the Volvo car company, which is building its factory on the southern border of the city of Košice. Given that Volvo Car Košice will be 100% climate neutral from day one and will produce fully electric vehicles, we see this as a significant potential to support the city's transformation towards climate neutrality not only in the field of industry, but as an inspiration for other companies and the residents themselves.

The city has been facing a decline in population over the last decade, which is caused not only by a lack of job opportunities, but also by strong suburbanization. The daily population is estimated at 300 thousand inhabitants. This creates strong pressure to address mobility.

In addition to the decline in population, the city's problems are vulnerable groups of residents. On the one hand, it is the increasing number of elderly residents (aging population), on the other hand, it is the large group of marginalized residents in the city. In addition to the localities where such people are concentrated, there are also 12 illegal settlements in the territory of the city, where 184 families, i.e., 988 persons, including 550 children under the age of 15, were living at the end of 2020. The City of Košice, in cooperation with the third sector, actively addresses the issue of people in need. It was the first in Slovakia to develop the successful "Housing first" concept and is currently participating in the European Homeless Census. To ensure a just transition, the city, together with all interested partners, will have to look for solutions that will bring the socio-economic benefits of the green transition to all its inhabitants and enable access to energy for all groups of the population.

Košice has acknowledged the importance of transformation to an environmentally sustainable city; thus, has proactively started to work on areas of development. Košice participates in international initiatives as Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy (2019), Green City Accord (2021) and Basque Declaration (2020) and projects as European Commission's Urban Innovative Actions (UIA) - Košice 2.0 project (2020), URBACT IV Programme - Cities for Sustainability Governance (2023, Interreg Danube Region Programme – HARMONMISSIONS, Harmonisation of Missions in the Danube region (2024) and CLIMAAX (2024). Through these projects, it not only addresses the change of governance of the city in favour of sustainable development, but also works with other sectors and residents to find solutions to climate change. It also seeks solutions for specific situations of concern to its inhabitants, such as the possible slide into energy poverty. It is precisely the answers to prevent this threat that the city, together with the third sector, will be looking for in the implementation of the Building Power project (2024), supported by the Pilot Cities Programme.

In addition, the city has developed initial plans to reduce CO2 emissions. Over the last 8 years, the city has started to see the need for a climate transformation more intensively and existing policies such as the Sustainable Mobility Plan (2015, update 2022) have been updated. Subsequently, the first GHG inventory (Baseline Emissions Inventory, 2018) and climate strategies such as the City's Climate Change Adaptation Plan (2022), the Climate and Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SECAP, 2022), the City's updated Master Plan 2022-2027 and others have been developed. Together with the forthcoming new spatial plan, these documents not only assess the current situation, but also define the city's steps towards its further transformation. At the same time, the city is also starting to work more intensively with its citizens through various campaigns such as the Earth Day, the European Mobility Week, the Car Free Day, etc. The city's efforts are supported by various initiatives from the academic, private, and civic sectors, which are not only directly involved in the city's activities but are also implementing their own projects to help citizens better understand the impact of climate change.

At the same time, it supports the decarbonisation of large enterprises, such as US Steel Košice, which is one of the largest air polluters in Europe, but also one of the largest employers in the city. The city, from the point of view of its competences and opportunities (spatial plan, membership of many boards), is actively addressing the needs of these companies in their decarbonisation process. Another major project that has come back to life after 30 years and is strongly advocated from the city level is the introduction of geothermal energy into the central heating system of Košice, which supplies 75% of the households in Košice with heat.

Several interesting projects related to the production and use of hydrogen are planned in Košice, e.g. a factory for the production of green hydrogen should be established, which will use waste, U.S. Steel Košice steelworks are planning to produce hydrogen with a new technology that includes electrolysis of water and steam reforming of methane, or the deployment of hydrogen buses for regional and suburban transport is being considered.

As can be seen, the city is working hard to tackle climate change. The city has the ambition to move towards climate neutrality, while trying to take advantage of all the opportunities available to the city and its partners. As the city's journey towards climate neutrality is still very short, we see an opportunity to acquire the necessary resources (knowledge, finance) by being part of the EU mission 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, of which the city is a member since 2022. Even if we are not currently able to meet the desired objectives of the mission and achieve climate neutrality, there is a strong internal motivation in the actions of the city and other actors to deal with the many obstacles that stand in the way of achieving climate neutrality.

The participation in Cities Mission has opened the door to new support and collaborations to accelerate the transformation of the city. However, working towards climate neutrality is a long path that requires implementation of a series of transformative actions that require not only the involvement and cooperation of residents and key partners in the city, but also sufficient time for preparation, implementation, and extensive financial resources. Such an example is the large-scale geothermal energy project for the city's central heating, which is starting these days and its complete completion will be far beyond 2030.

The presented Climate Treaty of the City of Košice represents a tool that has connected the existing strategies and plans of the city, leverage and, together with the efforts of other partners of the city, represents a joint and more intensive effort to transform the city in the climate field. The preparation and implementation of the Climate City contract is a great challenge for the city and the partners who have entered this process with us precisely because they are aware of the need to jointly find solutions in this urgent social issue. Together, we have the opportunity to overcome barriers more effectively and make better use of opportunities on the way to climate neutrality, thus building a success story that can be an example not only for Slovak cities, but also an inspiration for cities beyond our borders.

## Work Process

The preparation of the Climate City Contract was managed by the city's strategic development department. As this department covers the preparation and monitoring of the city's key climate policies, the preparation of the Climate City Contract began by leveraging existing experience and partnerships that expanded as the Action Plan took shape.

Our great ambition was to involve the state in the process, where we proposed defining and enforcing specific policies to promote climate neutrality at the city level and identifying and launching effective support mechanisms. However, this effort remained without much response.

In November 2023, a workshop was organized with advisors from NetZeroCities, where the work process and the creation of the transition team were discussed.

A Core Team is made up of representatives of the strategic development department. The Core Team intensified its work towards the end of 2023. Work on the Climate City Contract began with an assessment of the existing policies and goals that the city has committed to so far. After a thorough analysis, the preparation of a participatory process began, the aim of which was to identify actions for the upcoming Action Plan. The participatory process for preparation of the Climate City Contract was carried out through individual Interviews and group discussions at several levels.

First, these were interviews and discussions with relevant departments in the city and businesses and organizations that are established by the city. Not only organizations that operate directly in the sectors were invited to the discussion, but also organizations that work with private sector, residents at the urban or community level, whether through various cultural or educational events. This was followed by a process in search of solutions with stakeholders through individual discussions as well as Urbact's local climate group workshops, which identified further potential partnerships and actions. We see the Climate City Contract as a continuous process that is also open to other stakeholders operating in the city.

Together, we have developed an action plan that reflects on relevant emissions domains, fields of action and explored all systematic levers in the context of our current data and capabilities and setting the stage for better future iterations.

The ecosystem that has been created consists of 13 signatory partners and other partners based on existing collaborations that have been formalised through memoranda of cooperation, etc. However, discussions have been held with dozens of other partners who, although they have not legitimised their support at the moment, are partners with whom we will continue to work closely. Based on the partners' agreement, the whole ecosystem will be further managed from the city level (by the Core Team) and relevant information and opportunities will be regularly shared among the actors according to their affiliation to each priority. In order to further develop this ecosystem, meetings of all signatories will be organized at least  $1 \times$  quarterly. All further interactions between partners will be done on an individual basis.

Table 1 shows the remaining emissions that represent the City's target values for the year 2030 (2040) by sectors. They are compiled from data currently available to the city. Any missing data will be subject to completion in the next iteration.

# 1 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

## 1.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

### GhG Emissions Baseline inventory

The first more comprehensive data in the field of emissions were processed by the City of Košice for the year 2018 in the form of the "Basic Emission Inventory". The data focused mainly on key sectors such as buildings, transport, energy production and partly waste. Another emission inventory was processed for the year 2020 for the purpose of the SECAP document. Again, the buildings, energy generation, transport and waste sectors were addressed without a breakdown by individual SCOPE. Data from the IPPU and AFOLU sectors from the city level were not addressed, therefore one of the first actions for future iterations of the Climate City Contract will be to complete the full data analysis. The unavailability of data and working with it presents a major barrier that the city must overcome. Since both data analyses for the City were done by outside contractors who were unwilling to share primary data and know-how with the City, we struggled with differing interpretations when processing the data into the Climate City Contract, which may result in minor deviations from the data presented. An area that has not been addressed at all from the level is residual emissions. As well as missing sectors and SCOPEs, data for residual emissions will be surveyed in the next iteration of the Climate City Contract.

City of Košice has reported the GHG emission inventory in MyCovenant Tracker. Last report was based on the year 2020 (This year was set as an ongoing monitoring year in SECAP processing). Due to the possibility of distortion of the data collected for the year 2020 as a covid year, 2018 was chosen as the accounting year for the base line for the City Climate Contract.

Due to the unavailability of all data, some data is used from the outputs of the Business as Usual (BAU) 2030 economic model. https://netzerocities.app/group-capabilitybuildingprogrammebuildingastrongeconomiccase

Emission inventories and other assessments will be carried out within the geographical boundaries of the City of Košice.

The emission inventory in 2018 (Table 2, 3, 4) shows that most energy is consumed, and most emissions are produced in the buildings sector. The second sector is the transport sector. Even though the city is surrounded by forests and has a large area of agricultural land, these sectors have not been addressed in terms of emissions production and sinks. In the case of industry, the largest number of emissions from the production of industrial products is generated by companies that are part of the ETS scheme and have therefore been omitted from the emissions inventory. As it was assumed that other industry in the city produces a very small share of emissions from industry, these emissions were not surveyed. Both sectors (IPPU, AFOLU) will be surveyed in the next reassessment.

As the above data on energy consumption and emissions show, buildings are the largest emitters in the city. Therefore, the main priority of the city will be to address the reduction of energy consumption in buildings and to switch energy production to RES production. The second largest emitter, and therefore a priority, is to address transport, in the context of reducing the need for car transport and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels in transport.

The inputs for the economic model for the baseline (Table 6.) were used from available strategies (SUMP), national and European level estimates and internal documents.

Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

## A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies

Although strategies are adopted at national, regional or local level that aim to adapt the territory to climate change and reduce emissions, most strategies do not have specific targets for the amount of CO2 reduced, which is why we have chosen not to take them into account when setting the emission gap. However, they can support the creation of tools that can support the implementation of solutions at the local level.

At the national level, several policies and strategies and laws are approved that have an impact on tackling climate change. The Act on Climate Change and Low-Carbon Transformation of Slovakia has not yet been adopted. The most relevant document at the national level is The Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) for the Slovak Republic 2021-2030. Slovakia's Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) is scheduled for revision to align with the 'REPowerEU' and 'Fit for 55' packages. However, the European Commission reproached it for not being ambitious enough and returned it to the Slovak Republic for refinement. Slovakia missed the June 30, 2024, submission deadline to the European Commission (EC) and had not begun the required public consultations by July 2024. Its resubmission is planned for autumn 2024. For this reason, it was not taken into account when defining the emission gap.

A number of strategies are adopted at regional level to promote adaptation to climate change and reduce adverse climate change activities. However, they are mostly adopted without specific targets for the amount of greenhouse gases reduced. These are the Regional PUM, the Hydrogen Strategy, the Adaptation Strategy and the Low-Carbon Strategy of Organizations in the Founding Competence of the Košice Region, which has a determined % of reductions, but monitors different reference years for different sectors. In order to avoid misinterpretation, the objectives of this Low-Carbon Strategy will not be considered when defining the emissions gap.

At the local level, several documents have been adopted that support the reduction of greenhouse gases in the city. However, only the SECAP document, adopted in 2022, has a specific goal, which declares the city's interest in reducing CO2 production by 40% by 2030 compared to 2005, where the interim monitoring year is 2020. To avoid any misunderstandings in interpretation (as the baseline for the Climate City Contract is 2018), we will not consider this commitment when determining the emissions gap. However, the measures from SECAP are adapted into the draft Action Plan the Climate City Contract.

A list of relevant policies, strategies and regulations is given in Table 7.

Table 8 (below) / Table A-2.1 is carried over projection from the BaU 2030 economic model. For information, it is supplemented with data from the Basic Emission Inventory (BEI) of the city from 2018.

The table calculates the emission gap by sector. The electricity consumption of the transport and lighting sectors is shown in the "Electricity" sector. The data in the "Others" sector is only addressed in the BAU (2030) projection. The city does not currently have data in the IPPU and AFOLU sectors. Both sectors will be addressed in the next iteration.

Similarly, for residual emissions, the city has not yet addressed this data. All these missing data will be addressed in the next iteration. The residual emissions data in Table 8 are from the BaU 2030 projection.

Since the SECAP document sets targets against 2005-2030, where the interim monitoring year is 2020 and for the purposes of the Climate City Contract the baseline year considered is 2018, we have decided not to consider the SECAP targets for the time being to avoid making a mistake. The same will be done for other strategies.

To ensure accuracy and completeness, any missing data will be detected in the next iteration.

# 1.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

# A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

Based on the outputs from the implemented mappings, in order to achieve climate neutrality of the City of Košice, it is essential to intensify efforts, especially in the field of energy systems, with an emphasis on the use of renewable energy sources and the reduction of energy consumption, and on building sustainable urban development of the city based on ecological and attractive transport and the adoption of a circular way of life in various spheres. No less important for the inhabitants of the city is the public space, which should be designed to serve all residents and support their quality of life. The most important systems that have been considered for the relevant areas include the technological/infrastructural system, the institutional/regulatory system, organizational systems, behavioral systems, social system and the financial system.

The ecosystem of stakeholders in the city were laid by the European Capital of Culture project in 2013, which started the transformation of the city from the point of view of the perception of culture and its place in the lives of residents and the economic development of the city. The initiated initiatives were followed by other large projects that brought new perspectives and ways to work with actors and residents, connect topics, correctly identify needs, barriers and propose solutions for a good life in the city. These were mainly the Košice 2.0 project implemented within the UIA, or the currently implemented CSG – Cities for Sustainable Development (Urbact IV) project, which brought together actors in the city looking for solutions to increase the climate resilience of the city from the academic environment, local government, the private sector and the non-profit sector (such as the Urbact local group).

In the preparation of the City Climate Contract, the knowledge gained from all interactions that took place in the city was put to good use, whether in strategic planning (creation of strategic documents and plans), finding solutions to specific problems (workshops, living labs, design sprints on topics related to solving climate change), discussions on opportunities that led to formalized cooperation (signing of memoranda and cooperation agreements).

Many discussions were carried out internally and specific changes in the management of some sectors (mobility, energy) had already been implemented at the time of the preparation of the CCC. In the process of preparing the CCC, a basic team was formed in the city, which established close cooperation with the relevant departments in the city and municipal enterprises.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

Reflecting on our starting points, barriers, and opportunities, we have defined 4 strategic priorities to be fulfilled in order to intensify our transition to climate neutrality:

Energy efficiency and the transition to renewable energy (Energy system &amp; Built environment)
The first priority of the city is to ensure the availability of energy to all its inhabitants with the maximum possible use of local resources and the management of energy in an efficient way in all sectors.

Sustainable mobility (Mobility &amp; Transport)
The support of mobility will focus mainly on increasing the greening of all transport, increasing the attractiveness and efficiency of public transport and non-motorized transport.

Sustainable urban development (Green infrastructure, Natured based solutions; Waste &amp; Circular economy)
The priority of sustainable urban development focuses on creating a quality environment for residents and adopting a circular way of life in everyday life, management, but also production processes. By focusing on saving natural resources and creating an opportunity to "give goods a second chance".

Progress through dialogue and cooperation (Cross sector)
The fourth key priority for change in the city, which also overlaps with other priorities, is active cooperation and constructive dialogue between stakeholders such as citizens, entrepreneurs, research and educational institutions, the private sector to highlight the need to address climate change across all sectors, areas, levels and levers.

All proposed activities not only have the potential to significantly reduce the production of greenhouse gases in the city of Košice, but also create opportunities for all residents, including vulnerable ones, whether it is the availability of clean energy, mobility or green areas in the city, in the form of services, new job opportunities or a quality environment that will lead to a improved quality of life of residents in our city.

# 2.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

Our portfolio consists of 14 main activities, which are further divided into sub-activities. These are planned activities or activities that will be further expanded based on good experience.

Within Slovakia it is planned to establish county energy centres including the city of Košice (Capacities for Regions project, 23 centres will be built), whose aim will be to mobilise professional potential towards energy self-sufficiency of the regions, respect for the limits of the natural environment and the needs of vulnerable social groups, and towards carbon neutrality.

Community energy
Despite the fact that Slovakia has adopted legislation that allows the creation of energy communities and communities producing energy from renewable sources, its application is difficult from the point of view of the functioning of the communities. It is therefore important to address both the legislation and to promote community energy independence, climate neutrality and community prosperity by supporting the development and implementation of decentralised renewable energy systems. Communities using RES can be established in residential locations, on public and private buildings and areas. One of the projects that are being implemented in this area is the DECA project.

Energy poverty tools
Design and testing of energy assistance tools, to help identify groups of city residents at risk of energy poverty. Implemented through the Building Power project from the Pilot Cities programme.  |

|   | **3.3 Buildings renovations**
Our goal is to increase the renovation rate from 1.5% to 3% for all types of buildings, through medium and deep renovation.  |
|   | **Municipal buildings**
The city owns 200 buildings of various nature - school buildings, administrative, cultural (including historical buildings) sports and buildings for the provision of social and health services. Most buildings are classified in lower energy classes. The need for funds of €60 million was estimated (in 2022) for the renovation of building envelopes, roofs by insulation, replacement of windows, heat generation equipment and regulation of heating systems. Priority is given to school buildings, which account for more than half of all buildings and which, due to insufficient funds, focus on small-scale maintenance and renovations. The city is intensively looking for funds, especially from external sources, for the preparation and renovation of its buildings. According to SECAP, the CO2 saving potential from the municipality building is 928 tCO2 per year.  |
|   | **Tertiary building sector**
There are 3 universities in Košice. Košice universities are planning significant investments in the comprehensive modernization of buildings and dormitories of public and state universities. For example, P.J. Šafárik University plans to carry out 20 modernizations by 2030, including the modernization of the greenhouse in the Botanical Garden. The estimated cost is €43.7 million. Tertiary building sector, especially state and regional institution searching for external sources. The university is actively involved in solving green topics also through the "Race to Zero – Green University" program
According to SECAP, the CO2 saving potential from the tertiary building sector is 928 tCO2 per year.  |

Bus electrification
Public transport in Košice is provided by bus and tram transport. Percentage of transport public transport performance measured in vehicle-kilometres in an environmentally friendly traction on the overall transport performance of public transport
Company in 2022 was at the level of 25%.
For the needs of civil protection, it is necessary to keep 52 diesel buses in the fleet. There are currently 23 electric buses in the fleet. For the electrification of bus transport, 109 buses (diesel and CNG) need to be replaced. By 2026, the replacement of diesel buses is planned at the level of 25%. By 2026, it is planned to replace diesel buses at the level of 25%, including the necessary charging infrastructure. €30 million has been allocated from EU funds for this purchase. At the current price of €975,000 for 1 electric bus, the electrification of the fleet will require financing of more than €80 million, which the city does not currently have available. To ensure the operation of electric buses, it is necessary to build a charging infrastructure and a new depot for electric buses, the construction cost of which is estimated at €16.2 million.

Modernization of tram infrastructure
Tram transport is an important component of public transport in the city of Košice, as it can be considered as an emission-free environmentally friendly type of transport. Fleet status as infrastructure is unsatisfactory for many sections and its improvement would be significant. It has contributed to more efficient transport in the city. The age of the vehicles exceeds 30 years and is technologically obsolete, as well as a large part of the line infrastructure. Total length of the tram public transport network operated is 33.7 km. There are currently 53 tram stops on this network. In 2016-2018, half of the length of tram lines was modernised. The modernization of the remaining tram tracks is ready for the project. The estimated cost of the modernization is €235 million. These funds are not available.
At the same time, the modernization and purchase of new trams in the estimated amount of €15 million, which the city has available from EU funds, is being prepared. An extensive reconstruction of the tram depot, which is financed from EU funds, is currently underway.  |

For the effective management of public transport, several projects and measures are being prepared from the city level as a smart traffic management - concept of preference of public transport vehicles through intersections, a concept of interfacing with dispatching centers, equipping buses with intersection detection equipment, gradual implementation of preference at intersections. Further, an important part will be the optimization of the line line (a new transport service plan needs to be prepared), the collection of data on passenger movement and the modernization of central traffic dispatching of public transport.

An important element of effective public transport management is integration with suburban transport, which should be in operation from 2026. The aim of the integration is to offer residents from the surrounding area commuting to Košice on a daily basis an alternative for sustainable transport. This integration should result in more connections, better continuity, cheaper travel on coordination of several carriers and better information for passengers.

All of the above measures (with the exception of the electrification of buses) should make public passenger transport more attractive and reduce the need for motorized passenger transport  |

The support of public and non-motorized transport is one of the key priorities of the SUMP of the city of Košice.
The City of Košice is aware of the importance of supporting non-motorized transport and its integration with other modes of transport. It is already involved in various campaigns to support cycling (e.g., the national campaign "Bike to Work"), monitors and evaluates the movement of cyclists. To support bicycle transport and its integration with public transport, the public transport company provides bicycle transport in the city, but also on selected lines to recreational locations. The support will be directed to creating a positive image of public and non-motorised transport.  |
|   |   |  7.2 Comprehensive network of cycling roads in the city the aim of the activity is to create a comprehensive network of cycling paths, including parkin places and other equipment, ensure connection with the outskirts of the city and, connection to recreational cycling. The city of Košice is currently preparing the construction of 25 km of bicycle roads. For larger-scale investments, the city mainly uses EU resources.  |

The SUMP defines the introduction of the following measures for traffic calming: Traffic calming in the form of zones 30 (establishment on service roads especially in residential areas, establishment of school zones, especially at kindergartens and primary schools), traffic calming in the form of residential zones (in the city centre and in areas with a residential function) and establishing of charging zone or zero/low emissions zone. In 2023, a zone with a maximum speed limit of 30 kilometres per hour (km/h) has already been established on 27 streets in Košice. The introduction of other zones will be carried out based on the requirements of residents and city districts. The calculations were not implemented. This will be the subject of further iterations.

Traffic calming by rerouting
The city bypasses under construction (total length 14,2 km) will help divert transit traffic from the city in the east-west direction. The road connection is being built in accordance with the Strategic Plan for the Development of Infrastructure of the Slovak Republic until 2030 – Masterplan – Transport Strategy of the Slovak Republic. Currently is building the southeastern part of the city bypass, which should be completed in 2025. At the same time, the construction of the southwestern part of the bypass is being prepared. According to the SUMP, the southeastern part of the city bypass will divert 10% of traffic from the city after completion.  |

## B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Calculations of residual emissions from the city level were not carried out. For the purposes of the City Climate Contracts, 20% is considered, which is the maximum value according to the instructions of the Info Kit. These data are presented only in Table 8/ A.2-1 Emission Gap.. Residual emissions calculations will be addressed in subsequent iterations.

Generally, the potential for residual emissions can be identified in the vast forest areas that surround the city, the ever-expanding green spaces in the city and the planting of trees, and the Hornád River, which forms the backbone of the city.

### Urban Forests

Urban forests are key in terms of residual emissions for the City of Košice. These forests, which are among the largest urban forest assets in Central Europe, cover an area of 19 432 hectares. Their importance lies in several key areas, namely carbon capture and biodiversity protection, and a source of drinking water. For the preservation of urban forests, artificial regeneration and education of protective forests and forests for special purposes is continuous.

### Green Spaces &amp; Planting trees

In addition to building large parks that will form a "ring" around the city, the city is continuously working with green areas in the city, which are created mainly by the reclamation of unused areas or paved areas. Since 2019, a total of more than 3500 trees have been planted in our city. Several hundred trees are planted annually.

### River Hornád

The Hornád River represents the backbone of the city of Košice. It flows from north to south. Originally a rugged river with side branches and islets, it gave way to the developing city. A significant remnant of the original meander of the Hornád River (with its own history) is the Mill Race (Mlynský náhon), where mills were built from the 14th century, which later burned down. At present, the Mill Race represents a poorly evaluated and only limited area accessible to the public. The city of Košice, together with non-profit organizations, has prepared a project of deep revitalisation of the watercourse "Mlynský náhon" and its surrounding. Resources of €13 million are needed for its implementation.

# 3 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

# 3.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

# C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

The fourth key priority for change in the city "Progress through dialogue and cooperation" (Cross sector). It is crucial not only for expanding the ecosystem, but for working with all sectors and residents. So that the desired change is achieved at all levels.

Solving the climate agenda in the city very much removes isolated solutions and helps to bring procedures that require deeper cooperation at the level of individual departments and municipal enterprises.

The main bearer of the climate agenda (the core team) in the city is the Strategic Development Department, which incorporates several key units for solving climate change. These are the Strategic Development Unit, the EU Project Implementation Unit, the Mobility Strategy Unit and the Data Policy and Analysis Unit. Other close cooperation is with the Department of the Chief Architect, the Department of Construction, Transport and Environment, the Department of Education and the Department of Social Affairs. Since 1.7.2024 (with the support of the project from the Pilot Cities - Building Power Program), the energy department has been operating in the city.

The city uses several tools to communicate with stakeholders (on a horizontal level) and strengthen the local ecosystem. First of all, it is the municipal organization Business Košice, whose task is to work with the private sector. At the same time, the existing ad-hoc cooperation within the CSG - Cities for Sustainable Governance (Network Action Planning, Urbact IV) project began to create a Local Urbact Group with a focus on climate transformation, which will form the basis of the stakeholder ecosystem composed of representatives of the academic sector, the private sector, civil society and residents. Cooperation and often communication at the vertical level remain problematic, which is mainly influenced by fragmented responsibilities divided between the state, the region and the city. In terms of layout, the city of Košice has a two-level self-government with 22 city districts, where isolated solutions are also often implemented. We want to overcome all these barriers by strengthening the ecosystem and working with actors to address climate change.

As part of the Harmonmissions project (2024-2026, Danube region programme), in which the city of Košice is also involved, a new governance structure is implemented, based on the cooperation of a group of adaptation and mitigation advisors and the Steering Committee, whose task is to look for ways to implement both missions more effectively and make recommendations to their regional and national governments. We also plan to use this project to strengthen cooperation at the vertical level in the field of solving climate change.

Greater involvement of residents in the development of the city is implemented through various projects such as UrbCitizenPower: Empower citizens for agency as driver for change in cities, where residents will be involved in planning in the field of green infrastructure.

In this work, we will also use the experience we have gained in solving joint projects within the framework of integrated territorial investments (ITI) or implementation of a project as Košice 2.0 implemented within UIA.

# C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

Social innovation plays a crucial role in addressing climate change in urban areas. The city plans to address these through community-led activities, a greater collaborative effort a targeted solutions to residents who are already or may fall into energy poverty. In addition, it will seek to make use of existing infrastructure, such as Science park - Steel park to bring the topics of climate change closer to her.

# Community-led activities

The main obstacle we need to overcome on the way to climate neutrality is behavioural change. It is planned to get closer to the city's inhabitants and effectively communicate the topic of climate change through tools that were created during the ECoC 2013. "Exchangers / Vymenny" (unused heat exchange stations), which were created in the city's housing estates during the ECoC, have become an integral part of the life of local communities. We plan to use this space, where communities meet at joint events, in community gardens, or during informal discussions about life in their locality, to raise awareness of the fight against climate change. Currently, about 5000 events are held annually in 7 such "Exchangers" in the 5 largest housing estates in Košice, which create a unique opportunity to get closer to the city's residents. The exchanger administrator (K-13 Košice Cultural Centers), who is our partner in the Climate City Contract, will direct part of the program to topics about climate change, which will be presented through art, creative industries, or volunteer activities.
KOSICE

#

# Collaborative Efforts

Effort to collaborate between social innovators, businesses, and governments is another important part on the road to climate neutrality.. These collaborations will focus on increasing resilience and seizing opportunities in the fight against climate change, especially through the city and already established organizations such as Creative Industry, K-13 Košice Cultural Centers and other organizations, such as Business Košice, whose task is to build networks across the entire ecosystem in the city. The result should be various programs, such as the Winter Sidewalk Maintenance Program of the city "Adopt Your Sidewalk", which is implemented by the city in cooperation with residents.

# Energy poverty

Energy poverty is a particular concern in Kosice's region of Eastern Slovakia, that is one of the 20 poorest in the EU, with a GDP that is  $51\%$  of the EU average. Together with the Central Slovakia region, Eastern Slovakia is identified by the European Commission as being at medium risk of migration, brain and talent drain of younger residents (15 to 39-year-olds). And residents are aging rapidly: three Kosice districts rank in the top eight nationally for expected increase in the percentage of residents of retirement age by 2030 (Slovak Academy of Science, 2023). The city and region also have the highest ethnic and linguistic heterogeneity in the country and are experiencing an increasing economic disparity vs. the rest of the country. These factors contribute to a relatively high rate of energy poverty in the city and region, relative to other EU countries. The partner ETP Slovakia, together with Municipality and other civil organisation will develop a set of tools to help residents in vulnerable groups to mitigate the effects of energy crisis and reduce energy poverty risk (Project Building Power, Pilot city programme). These tools will address the needs of specific vulnerable groups living in Kosice. And so it will make it possible to prevent a situation that would prevent them from accessing energy.

# 4 Outlook and next steps

# Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

We see this initial proposal for an urban climate agreement as the beginning of a process by which we initiated the beginning of a certain change. We consider this document to be a living document that will be updated in 2 years interval. To improve the quality of the Action Plan and the defined pathways for achieving climate neutrality, the following steps will be implemented by the city and its partners:

Improvement and expansion of the economic model and provision of relevant inputs: For the needs of the correct use of the economic model, it is necessary to provide all relevant data for all sectors and scopes, residual emission including. At the same time, it is necessary to adopt methodologies for assessing CO2 emission reductions for all implemented and prepared activities.
Expand the ecosystem of partners for the implementation of activities that are not detailed in the plan. In an effort to respond to the need for input into the economic model, some activities were designed on a general level with goals defined on the basis of qualified estimates of experts, but without securing specific stakeholders (for example, in the case of electrification of freight transport). At the same time, financial planning will need to be resolved.
Strengthening the defined pathways and expanding the ecosystem of partners: Furthermore, it is necessary to expand activities to strengthen planned pathways in all sectors, areas and systems, e.g. how to deal with the modernization of historic buildings in buildings, to deal with air transport and the IPPU and AFOLU sectors, etc.
Financial planning: Intensively seek together with our partners the financing of the activities defined in the action plan to secure their implementation. Most of the activities implemented at the level of the city and our partners

are financed from EU funds in the 2021-2027 programming period, which are not insufficient to cover the defined activities. Securing the necessary funding will be crucial for this and future Action Plan as well.

# 1 Introduction

In 2022, Košice was selected from 377 European cities to be part of the Mission EU 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities. The city has been honoured to be part of an ambitious initiative that makes the selected cities experimental hubs for innovation with the aim of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 and thus becoming an example for other European cities.

The implementation plan for this Mission envisages that each of the 100 + 12 selected cities will develop a Climate City Contract that does not represent a legalistic commitment but sends a clear political signal to the citizens and actors operating in the city, in the region, the state and EU. In developing the Climate City Contract, each city will draw on its own reality and, through a process of co-creation and in close collaboration with the whole of civil society and citizens, will develop a strategy that will not only create the conditions for its own transformation, but will serve as an inspiration for other European cities to become climate neutral by 2050.

In this way, this document meets the requirements of the European Cities Mission. It has been developed by the city with the participation of other public and private stakeholders, some of whom have joined the initiative as signatories, and sets out plans to achieve climate neutrality throughout the defined framework, although refinements and additions will be needed in some places. Its ambition is to deliver solutions for all its citizens, including vulnerable groups. To make the contribution to climate neutrality as effective as possible, this Climate City Contract will be expanded and updated.

The document is divided into 3 parts: one concerning the City's commitment and strategic priorities, which are presented in this section, the Climate Action Plan (CAP, Annex 1), which defines the pathway for achieving the objectives, and the Climate Investment Plan (CIP, Annex 2).

# The city of Košice and its journey

The city of Košice has undergone several transformations in its history. After the completion of the steel giant (now US Steel) in the 1980s, Košice became one of the fastest growing cities in the former Czechoslovakia. By the beginning of the new millennium, Košice began to transform from a city dependent on heavy industry to a more diverse and cleaner metropolis with a mix of services, culture and education to complement the remaining heavy industry. The systematic decline of the heavy industry workforce has been replaced by a corresponding systematic increase in the IT (10,000 employees), culture and creative and soft industries workforces. The title of European Capital of Culture, which the city became in 2013, has strengthened the development of these sectors and brought a new culture of cooperation between sectors and a more intensive cooperation with the third sector and especially with the citizens to the city.

The transformation of the city from heavy industry to clean industry already at the beginning of the new millennium seemed to foreshadow the path Košice should follow. As the city intensively seeks opportunities to build its climate resilience and neutrality, joining the EU's Mission 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 represents a key milestone on this journey. It is the preparation of the Climate City Contract that allows to link past experiences with new plans and bring together actors who have not actively cooperated until now.

Košice recognises the importance of transforming into an environmentally sustainable city and with the arrival of the current leadership (2018) has started to actively work on relevant areas of development. The City of Košice made its first climate commitment to reduce its emissions by 40% in 2019, which it has sought to not only meet but also increase with each subsequent activity. The steps that the City of Košice has taken towards building a climate friendly city are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Evolution of initiatives carried out by the City of Košice

In addition, the city began to engage in major development projects to increase the quality of life in the city, civic engagement in cultural, social and economic activities and improving the city's services.

One such project that further developed the ideas of ECoC 2013 was the Košice 2.0 project implemented within Urban Innovative Actions (UIA). This project used innovative approaches to connect city administration, entrepreneurs and residents on current social issues, including addressing the climate crisis. Other projects are currently being implemented and in the pipeline that seek answers to effectively address the impacts of climate change in the city, including a number of infrastructure projects in the areas of energy efficiency of buildings and facilities, public passenger transport, non-motorised transport, green and blue infrastructure.

The city has been a strong advocate of supporting large decarbonisation projects, both public sector and private sector. One of these projects is the use of geothermal energy from the nearby Ďurkov area, which could be used as a source of energy for the central heating supply (2021, Memorandum of Cooperation on the use of the energy potential of geothermal boreholes in the Ďurkov area with the Ministry of Economy and SPP infrastructure). It also expressed support for planned decarbonisation projects to one of the largest steels (and greenhouse gas)

producers in Europe, U.S. Steel Košice (2022, Memorandum of Understanding on planned support for decarbonisation projects). The city also supports the arrival of strategic investors in the city who are responsible for climate change, such as the Swedish car company Volvo, which is building a climate-neutral plant near Košice. This can have a significant positive impact on changing the behaviour of the city's inhabitants.

The city of Košice is currently preparing a new spatial plan after 50 years. This presents a key opportunity for defining climate-friendly measures in the form of various land use regulations, sustainable transport and energy solutions, and planning rules for transformation and new development areas, for example, the preparation of a new and the first carbon-neutral urban district "New Urban Centre Hornád" (2055) has started.

However, the pursuit of climate neutrality is a long journey that requires the implementation of a series of transformative measures that can only be realised with the involvement and close collaboration of citizens and key industry, academic and government actors. For the city, this presents another major challenge in which it must learn how to work with an ever-expanding ecosystem of partners.

The city's involvement in the EU Mission has brought new opportunities for the city to collaborate, gain knowledge and exchange experiences, and also directly support innovation in the city. The preparation of the City Climate Contract has created an official space for the direct involvement of other actors in addressing climate change, their interconnection and the opportunity to act within one large ecosystem, which is the city itself.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Achieving climate neutrality in a city that is home to one of the largest emitters in Europe is a very big challenge. For this reason, the city of Košice did not set a specific goal for achieving climate neutrality in the city's Mission Expression of Interest. It was important for the city to start this process of change and to look for all other opportunities to accelerate this change. Even at the cost of not fulfilling pre-defined frameworks and conditions. All the achievements that are made on an ongoing basis are important for the city because they are milestones on the way to the bigger goal, which in our case is climate neutrality.

The key sectors that the city has to deal with in terms of emissions are buildings and transport. But it does not neglect other relevant sectors such as waste, AFOLU or IPPU, which are important for a balanced and sustainable development of the city.

Figure 2: Projected $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$ emission reductions in kilotons by sectors (BaU 2030)

It is estimated that these four sectors together can reduce 68% of total emissions. Based on the economic case developed for the city under this Contract, the actions planned in the city, primarily targeting these four sectors, would result in an annual reduction of 611 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030+. This is our intermediate milestone that we have the ambition to move towards climate neutrality during the implementation of the Climate City Contract. Figure 2 shows projected $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$ emission reduction in kilotons by sectors (according to the BAU 2030 economic model).

The commitments and objectives of the Climate City Contract are addressed for the area of the city bounded by its administrative boundaries.

Fulfilling the primary objective of this Mission will also bring a number of other co-benefits to the city that will benefit the city's residents, such as increased independence from fuel imports, savings in energy costs, new jobs, promotion of biodiversity in the city, as well as better and safer public spaces, better air quality, which will have a positive impact on the health of the residents, and a better quality of life for the residents in the city.

The city has decided to exclude Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector from the scope of its climate neutrality target. This decision was taken due to the fact that even though the Košice's main large scale industrial facility (U. S. Steel Košice, s.r.o) together with some of the smaller plants are located within the city's boundary, they are registered under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), and are therefore exempt from the Mission. Additionally, due to the very small number of daily flights to and from Košice's airport, also air transport will be excluded from the scope. This is because these flights make an imperceptible contribution to the city's emissions so the efforts for this source's measurement and management could be better utilized somewhere else. Despite this fact, the City will continue to work with large polluters and inspire other industries (including air transport) to actively support the City to meet its climate and energy goals.

# 3 Strategic priorities

Participation in the Mission EU 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities is another milestone for the City of Košice, which will accelerate its transformation into a green city, ensure that the city's ambitions on its path to climate neutrality are fulfilled, and inspire other cities in the region.

Reflecting on our starting points, barriers and opportunities, we have defined 4 strategic priorities to be fulfilled in order to intensify our transition to climate neutrality:

# 1. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND THE TRANSITION TO RENEWABLE ENERGY

Up to 82% of the city's greenhouse gas emissions are generated by energy production and consumption in city buildings. More sustainable energy production and consumption is therefore crucial for the city, which we can achieve in particular through improving the energy efficiency of buildings and switching to renewable energy sources. Košice sees a great opportunity to replace fossil fuels for heating with renewable sources, using the energy potential of geothermal resources from the nearby Ďurkov area. At the same time, given the large number of vulnerable groups, it is important for the city to ensure that energy is available to all its inhabitants.

# 2. SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY

Transport within the city produces 9% of greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts in the transportation sector will continue through further encouragement towards environmental friendliness, traffic calming in the city, active and alternative modes of mobility such as cycling, walking, public transport and shared mobility. All these measures will also lead
KOŠICE

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

to ensuring accessible and safe mobility for all residents, including vulnerable groups. This should also have a positive impact on improving air quality and human health.

## 3. SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT

Košice aims to develop into a city that uses urban greenery to support urban ecosystems, open and quality public spaces for citizens, and integrates nature-based climate change adaptation solutions into the city. At the same time, the planned expansion and improvement of green spaces will play a key role in creating a social, creative and active environment in which citizens can thrive.

Reducing the consumption of goods and materials is another key priority for the sustainable development of the city. Therefore, the city will focus on promoting the adoption of a circular way of life, which is expected to reduce waste production and increase recycling rates, not only in terms of material use, but also in terms of improving the living conditions of vulnerable groups of the population.

## 4. PROGRESS THROUGH DIALOGUE AND COOPERATION

The fourth key priority for bringing about change in the city is active cooperation and constructive dialogue between stakeholders such as citizens, entrepreneurs, research and educational institutions, the private sector, etc. This is not only to achieve synergistic effects of the activities of the different actors, but also to be self-aware of what each individual in our city can do and achieve for this transformation. This is what the city wants to achieve through active communication, the promotion of community activities and the creation of various opportunities for the discovery and self-realisation of its inhabitants.

All of these activities will generate changes that together will bring about a huge reduction in the production of greenhouse gases in the city of Košice. In order to translate these priorities into reality, an ecosystem of actors has begun to be built, in which each actor will make an individual effort to implement activities that will contribute to accelerating the city's transformation towards climate neutrality. At the same time, crucially, they ensure a just transition for all groups of the population, including vulnerable groups such as low-income groups, the elderly and children.

## 4 Process and principles

The main driver of the climate agenda (core team) in the city, and also the vehicle for implementing the City's Climate Contract, is the Strategic Development Department, which includes several key departments for addressing climate change. These are the Strategic Development Unit, the EU Project Implementation Unit, the Mobility Strategy Unit and the Policy and Data Analysis Unit. Further close cooperation will be necessary with the Department of the Chief Architect, the Department of Construction, Transport and Environment, the Department of Education and the Department of Social Affairs. Since 1 July 2024 (with the support of the Pilot Cities - Energy for Buildings programme), the Energy Department has been operating in the city.

The city will use several tools to communicate with stakeholders (at horizontal level) and strengthen the local ecosystem. First of all, there is the city's Business Košice organisation (established in 2023), whose role is to work with the private sector. Through this organisation, a network of partners will be built, with an emphasis on promoting climate-neutral solutions, including raising resources to support the market uptake of emerging solutions. At the same time, within the framework of the existing ad-hoc cooperation within the CSG - Cities for Sustainable Governance (Networked Action Planning, Urbact IV. project, a Local Urbact Group with a focus on climate transformation has started to form the basis of an ecosystem of stakeholders composed of representatives from the academic sector, private sector, civil society and citizens.
KOŠICE

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

When identifying partners, it built on already existing cooperation and reached out to other partners whose activities could contribute to intensifying the path towards climate neutrality.

The challenge for us remains to improve communication and cooperation at the vertical level (state - region - city - urban districts). This is mainly influenced by divergent opinions, the change of which requires showing concrete implemented actions, which the city hope to achieve in the implementation of the prepared Climate Action Plan.

For effective and beneficial implementation of the Climate City Contract the City of Košice and its partners will be guided by the following principles:

Openness to new approaches - Willingness to search, support and apply new approaches to address the defined priorities more effectively.
Co-creation - Involving a wide range of partners in the search for effective solutions.
Inclusive partnerships - Applying collaborative efforts that bring together diverse stakeholders to achieve common goal.
Transparency and Accountability - Ensuring that all parties involved in the fulfilment of the objectives of this mission approach the implementation of planned activities responsibly and that the results of everyone's work are communicated in a transparent manner.
Leaving no one behind - ensuring that all citizens, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized, benefit from these efforts.
Monitoring and mutual learning - Regular monitoring and evaluation of the Climate City Contract implementation and mutual learning through shared experiences and knowledge exchange.

The implementation of the Climate City Contract will be monitored and evaluated by the City of Košice in cooperation with the actors involved. The City of Košice will be directly responsible for monitoring. The implementation of the objectives and the measurement of progress will be carried out at two-yearly intervals. In the process of preparing the Climate City Contract, a number of gaps have been identified that the city needs to address if it is to successfully implement the Contract and demonstrate its progress. We consider the implementation of this contract to be a continuous process and an open-ended process that will confront the city with the realities of a constantly evolving city and that will bring the city to the desired goal of climate neutrality.
