# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

In 2022, the City of Liepājas decided to apply and was also selected as one of the EU's "100 climate neutrals and smart cities by 2030", thus setting more ambitious targets - achieving climate neutrality, i.e. reducing CO₂ equivalent emissions (further – CO₂ emissions) by 80% compared to 2006. In line with joining the initiative of the EU mission "100 climate neutrals and smart cities by 2030", in 2023 the municipality of Liepājas updated its SECAP with concrete and targeted actions. The city of Liepājas has identified five key priorities: Energy efficiency, Digitalization, Renewable energy resources, Adaptation to climate change and education of society.

In order to achieve 80% CO₂ emissions reductions, key sectors were identified where this reduction can be achieved, how and to what extent:

Local government infrastructure: energy efficient and environmentally friendly (share of the total CO₂ emission reductions – 6%):
Continuous maintenance of the energy management system;
Use of renewable energy resources in heating of local government buildings;
Green renewable electricity in municipal infrastructure;
Environmental friendly mobility and services;
E-services.

Centralised energy production: green energy for all (share of the total CO₂ emission reductions – 29%):
Transition to 100% RES;
Attracting new thermal energy consumers to Liepājas DH.

Transport and mobility: accessible and sustainable mobility for all (share of the total CO₂ emission reductions – 60%):
Calming and optimisation of transport flows;
Accessibility and poularisation of environmentally friendly public transport;
Promoting electromobility and micromobility.

Industry and services: "green" urban industry (share of the total CO₂ emission reductions – 5%):
"Energy efficiency in the first place" principle;
Transition to renewable energy sources in industry and services sector.

Housing: renovated and accessible housing for all:
Renewal of apartment buildings;
Educating the public;
Transition of private houses to RES.

Adaptation to climate change: climate resilient city of Liepaja:
Adaptation to climate change;
CO₂ capture measures and nature-based solutions.

In order to achieve climate neutrality, the following horizontal aspects will be taken into account and integrated throughout the planning and implementation process:

Enhanced cooperation with all stakeholders, including industry, service providers, non-governmental organisations, citizens and others.
Principles such as "energy efficiency in the first place", "green procurement", "innovative financial instruments" will be integrated throughout the policy planning and implementation chain not only in the municipality, but also more broadly, such as industrial companies, etc.
The benefits and disadvantages of future policies and measures will be assessed from environmental, social, economic, financial and other aspects.

All planning, implementation and monitoring processes will ensure a cross-sectoral approach.

In addition to the CO₂ reduction targets, Liepāja sets quantitative and qualitative targets also in energy and adaptation to climate change sectors, as well as for the reduction of energy poverty by 2030.

In order to achieve the goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2030, the involvement of all groups of society will be more intensive than it has been up to now. In each of the sectors included in the plan, there are certain CO₂ reduction targets for which the Management and Monitoring Group will be responsible for the overall achievement, and for the sub-sectors, the local government commissions or groups responsible:

Transport infrastructure commission;
Plant monitoring commission; Environment commission and Public health commission;
Energy efficiency group with 3 sub-groups;
Tourism commission;
The environmental communication group;
Waste management advisory working group;
CCC group;
Public procurement commission.

It is important not only to improve and strengthen the organisational structure of the municipality in order to achieve the objectives, but to involve all stakeholders. The involvement of each of the parties involved will require targeted measures. The organisations mentioned above will be responsible for their implementation.

The funding needed to implement the measures included in SECAP2030 can be derived from a variety of funding sources: short-term and medium-term local government budget measures; private funds for long-term projects related to building renovation; EU structural funds for the rest of the RES and other long-term energy efficiency measures, and sustainable transport solutions, national co-financing, as well as other financial instruments such as EUCF. The financial envelope for now is EUR 229,23 million.

Future plans planned for the city of Liepāja:

Approve the renewed SECAP2030 and sign the Climate City agreement.
Establishing an organisational structure for the implementation and monitoring of the plan in accordance with the organisational framework described in the plan.
Prepare a specific timetable for the implementation of action for 2023-2025, including the responsible persons and the necessary resources.
Provide an organisational framework for the implementation and monitoring of the plan.
The introduction and involvement of all groups of society in the implementation of priority measures, including the monitoring of activities.
Evaluate and supplement the plan with a calculation for energy consumption and emissions from Liepāja City waste management.
Review the plan at least every two years (next in 2025) and to evaluate both the progress and achievements of the implementation of the measures and to review the measures needed to achieve the objectives and to plan additional measures.

# 1 Introduction

The introduction should outline the local policy context in which the Action Plan is being developed and describe the gap it is addressing in broad terms.

## Introduction - textual element

In Latvia, the development of a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP or Action plan) is not mandatory for municipalities, but the Energy Efficiency Law states that municipalities have the right to develop and adopt an energy plan as a separate document or as part of the municipality's spatial development programme, which includes certain energy efficiency targets and measures.

On 15 November 2012, the City of Liepāja joined the Covenant of Mayors initiative. This was the first political commitment of a municipality to implement and follow climate and energy policies at local level. It was a key driver for the municipality to develop and implement initially the Sustainable Energy Action Plan 2020 (SEAP2020) and now the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2030 (SECAP2030). When the City of Liepāja initially joined the initiative, it committed to achieving at least a 20% reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2020. By 2022, the city had already reduced its CO₂ emissions by 45% compared to 2006, the baseline year. Since joining the Covenant of Mayors, awareness of climate and energy objectives has increased significantly at all levels.

In 2022, the City of Liepāja decided to apply and was selected as one of the 100 European Climate Neutral Cities ("Net Zero Cities"), thus setting much more ambitious targets - to reduce CO₂ emissions by 80% by 2030. In line with the 100 European Climate Neutral Cities initiative, Liepāja Municipality is updating its SECAP in 2023 with more specific and targeted actions. However, it is important to acknowledge that the successful attainment of these goals for the City of Liepāja depends on navigating and mitigating a multitude of external factors, some of which may be beyond the direct control of the city.

# 2 Work Process

This section should list the working steps carried out, for example along the NZC Climate Transition Map, or related steps planned as well as outline timeline and milestones for future iterations for the continuous development of the Action Plan.

## Work Process - combination of textual and visual elements

In 2008, the European Commission launched the Covenant of Mayors initiative to endorse and support the efforts of local authorities in implementing sustainable energy policies. The Covenant of Mayors is currently the only movement that brings together local and regional actors to achieve the EU's objectives.

The City of Liepāja made a significant step towards addressing climate and energy issues by joining the Covenant of Mayors initiative on November 15, 2012. This commitment served as a catalyst for the municipality to develop and execute the Sustainable Energy Action Plan 2020 (SEAP2020), and subsequently, the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2030 (SECAP2030). The City of Liepāja pledged to achieve a minimum 20% reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2020. Remarkably, by 2022, the city had already surpassed this target, successfully reducing its CO₂ emissions by 45% compared to the baseline year of 2006. The impact of joining the Covenant of Mayors has been substantial, fostering heightened awareness of climate and energy objectives at all levels. This progress led to the City of Liepāja setting even more ambitious goals, now committing to attain climate neutrality by 2030, as of the year 2023.

Liepāja emerged as one of the pioneering municipalities in Latvia by implementing a certified energy management system in 2018. This system was designed to systematically curtail energy consumption in municipal infrastructure. The implementation of this system yielded substantial results, delivering energy savings of up to 5% in its initial years. Moreover, it stands out as a cost-effective measure that serves as an exemplary model for other municipalities to follow.

Since 2014, the local district heating company, "Liepājas enerģija," has undertaken various fuel switch projects, transitioning from natural gas to biomass. As a result of these initiatives, approximately 80% of the city's heat production in 2022 derived from sustainable wood chips. This commendable shift has led to 85% reduction in CO₂ emissions from the domestic energy sector, when compared to the year 2006.

Liepāja is at the forefront of Latvian municipalities that have made significant strides in renovating a substantial portion of their apartment buildings. By 2023, nearly 200 out of 600 apartment buildings connected to the Liepāja district heating system have been renovated. These renovations have yielded remarkable outcomes, with heat consumption decreasing by over 50%.

Recognising the importance of public transport, Liepāja has made noteworthy investments in expanding its tram lines by 1.7 kilometers. This development offers residents and visitors an environmentally friendly mode of transportation. Additionally, this measure has facilitated the replacement of fossil fuel-powered buses.

To illustrate the City of Liepāja's trajectory towards climate neutrality and its key objectives, actions, and outcomes, refer to Figure 1, which provides a comprehensive roadmap.

Figure 1: Liepāja's roadmap to climate neutrality

On 19 March 2020, the City of Liepāja Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2020-2030 was approved. It set a target of stabilising the city's  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions at  $45\%$  level by 2030, compared to 2006. The updated SECAP included also a long-term vision to reduce  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions by  $80\%$  by 2050. Notably, climate adaptation measures were also integrated into the plan, recognizing the importance of addressing the impacts of climate change.

In 2022, Liepāja decided to apply and was selected as one of the 100 European Climate Neutral Cities ("Net Zero Cities"), setting much more ambitious targets - to reduce  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions by  $80\%$  by 2030, compared to 2006. In line with the 100 European Climate Neutral Cities initiative, city of Liepāja is currently in the process of updating its SECAP in 2023. This update will entail the formulation of more specific and targeted actions, ensuring a robust roadmap towards achieving these ambitious goals. The City of Liepāja has identified five key priorities that will guide its efforts towards climate neutrality. These priorities, summarized in Figure 2, serve as a strategic framework for implementing effective measures and fostering sustainable development in the city.

Figure 2: Liepāja's key priorities towards climate neutrality

During the development of the plan, public participation events were organised where participants actively discussed and expressed their views on Liepāja's goal to become one of the first 100 climate-neutral cities in Europe and how to achieve it. For example, hackathons, discussions with NGOs and ministries, organising Energy Efficiency Week, European Mobility Week, etc. The events discussed potential measures in the areas of transport, energy efficiency and climate change adaptation, among others. The ideas and recommendations from the events have been incorporated into the plan.

Considering the plan's focus on medium-term objectives, it is crucial to conduct regular reviews at least every two years. These reviews serve multiple purposes. Firstly, they enable an assessment of the progress made and achievements attained thus far. Secondly, they facilitate a thorough evaluation of the actions implemented to gauge their efficacy in meeting the set objectives. Lastly, the reviews provide an opportunity to plan additional actions that may be necessary to ensure the successful realization of the goals outlined in the plan. This iterative and adaptive approach ensures that the plan remains dynamic and responsive to the evolving needs and challenges of Liepāja's journey towards climate neutrality.

Future plans planned for the city of Liepāja:

Approve the renewed SECAP2030 and sign the Climate City agreement.
Establishing an organisational structure for the implementation and monitoring of the plan in accordance with the organisational framework described in the plan.
Prepare a specific timetable for the implementation of action for 2023-2025, including the responsible persons and the necessary resources.
Provide an organisational framework for the implementation and monitoring of the plan.
The introduction and involvement of all groups of society in the implementation of priority measures, including the monitoring of activities.
Evaluate and supplement the plan with a calculation for energy consumption and emissions from Liepāja City waste management.

The lack of a convincing and inclusive co-creation and co-implementation plan or strategy for now is a weakness in Liepāja's CCC. Liepāja still faces a potential threat due to insufficient focus on deeper citizen engagement. To address this, the city will continue to recognise citizens as distinct stakeholders, acknowledging their potential as powerful advocates and drivers of change. To mitigate this threat, a stronger emphasis on citizen involvement is crucial, fostering understanding and support for climate actions.

Introducing to the citizens the CCC's purpose, city vision, and what is at stake will make the commitment more robust. Emphasizing the role of the Mission and CCC is essential like it has been done with status Liepāja – European Capital of Culture 2027 which all citizens know about.

# 3 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

Part A “Current State of Climate Action” describes the point of departure of the city towards climate neutrality, including commitments and strategies of key local businesses, and informs the subsequent modules and the outlined pathways to accelerated climate action.

# 3.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Module A-1 “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory” should detail and describe the city’s latest GHG inventory to establish the emission baseline and to establish the emissions gap to 2030 climate neutrality according to the inventory specifications defined in the Cities Mission’s Info Kit for Cities and the process outlined in the Action Plan Guidance.

The City of Liepāja embarked on its sustainability journey by developing its first Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) in 2013, shortly after joining the Covenant of Mayors. In this process, detailed data on energy consumption and emissions since 2006 was collected, and 2006 was chosen as the base year for comparison. Subsequently, in 2020, Liepāja progressed to develop the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2030 (SECAP2030), again utilizing 2006 as the base year.

Upon joining the Net Zero Cities initiative, the Liepāja SECAP2030 underwent an update, with the year 2030 established as the target for achieving climate neutrality. Notably, the base year for comparison remained consistent with the previous plans, retaining 2006 as the reference point.

To achieve the climate neutrality goal, Liepāja aims to reduce its $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by a significant $80\%$ compared to the levels recorded in 2006. However, it is important to acknowledge that the successful attainment of these goals for the City of Liepāja depends on navigating and mitigating a multitude of external factors, some of which may be beyond the direct control of the city.

The emissions boundaries for Liepāja are confined to the city's territory, which spans 68 square kilometers. With a population of 67,088, Liepāja is positioned between the Baltic Sea to the west and Liepāja Lake to the east. Its northern and southern boundaries demarcate with the administrative region "Dienvidkurzemes novads." Understanding these geographical and demographic parameters is essential for effective emissions management and sustainable development strategies within the city.

A-1.2: Emission factors applied

The City of Liepāja employed the methodology outlined in the Covenant of Mayors' guidelines on "How to develop a Sustainable Energy Action Plan" to ascertain greenhouse gas emissions. To quantify emissions accurately, a measurement unit of tonnes of CO₂ was adopted, with calculations based on aggregated energy consumption data. Specifically, in the context of heat, emissions were determined by considering the fuel consumption required for heat production.

Emissions from "Liepājas energijja" boiler houses are calculated based on the amount of fuel consumed. IPCC as well as the national emission factors listed in the table below have been used in the calculations:

|  Amount of natural gas consumed, lowest heat of combustion for natural gas (9.35 MWh/1000 m³) |   |   | 0.202 tCO₂/MWh  |

The assessment of other Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions has been addressed in a separate planning document, such as the City of Liepāja's Air Quality Improvement Program, designed to evaluate the current air quality situation in Liepāja and propose air quality improvement measures for the period 2021-2025. The Action Program for the Improvement of Air Quality in Liepāja for 2021-2025 (hereinafter referred to as the Action Program) is developed with the aim of ensuring and enhancing air quality in the city. Measurements taken at air quality monitoring stations indicate that the most significant air quality issues, including air quality not meeting World Health Organisation standards, are observed in Latvian cities such as Riga, Liepāja, and Rēzekne.

The Liepāja Air Quality Improvement Action Program is aligned with Latvia's Air Pollution Reduction Action Plan for 2020-2030, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on April 16, 2020, with No. 197. The implementation of the planned measures will contribute to achieving the emission reduction goals set at the EU level for 2020, 2025, and 2030, promoting the attainment of air quality conducive to human health and ecosystem protection in Latvian cities. The execution of the measures outlined in the program will also contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate impact.

The Action Program involves an analysis of the current situation, emission trends, emission forecasts, modeling, and information on key pollution sources. The planned actions for 2021-2025 are based on the research results. The existing air quality situation in Liepāja was assessed using measurements taken from February to June 2021, covering both heating and non-heating seasons. Household, transportation, and industrial impacts were examined, compliance with regulatory requirements was determined, measurement data were analyzed, and air pollution modeling was conducted. While the current situation does not indicate exceedances of air quality standards, the program considers urban development and proposes measures for air quality improvement and monitoring in Liepāja to maintain air quality indicators at least at the current level.

The Action Program for Air Quality Improvement in Liepāja includes the following main sections:

Section "Nature and Assessment of Air Pollution" provides information on legal regulations in Latvia and the European Union (EU), air quality standards, and describes the levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollutant benz(a)pyrene, and heavy metal concentrations in Liepāja. The section also examines types of air pollution sources and stationary air pollution sources.

Section "Measurement Results" describes the results of air pollution measurements for pollutants covered during the development of this program, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollutant benz(a)pyrene, and heavy metal concentrations.

Section "Atmospheric Pollution Modeling" and Section "Results of Atmospheric Pollution Modeling" provide information on the results of air pollution modeling.

Section "Territorial Maps of Air Pollution" displays air pollution maps showing the concentration and spatial distribution of air pollution in Liepāja.

Section "Measures for Air Quality Improvement" describes selected measures for air quality improvement in Liepāja and evaluates the effectiveness of air quality measures, considering overall societal benefits and summarizing the results of public consultations.

The Liepāja City Municipality, recognising the seriousness of climate change, has focused on reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, extending beyond carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction. This is evident in the aforementioned Action Program. Future measures will include expanding emission reduction goals to encompass not only CO2 but also other GHGs. Life cycle assessments will be conducted to identify and qualify emissions from various activities and sectors. Collaboration with other city municipalities has commenced to jointly address climate change challenges and share experiences.

## A-1.6: Description and assessment of GHG baseline inventory

Figure A-1.5.1 shows the changes in the total energy consumption of the city of Liepāja since 2006. Since 2006, the city's energy consumption has decreased by 15%, reaching 863 538 MWh in 2022. In 2022, the largest share is accounted for by private transport (29%), heat consumption (24%) and natural gas consumption (22%).

Figure A-1.5.2 shows the energy consumption in Liepāja in 2022 by main groups.

Figure A-1.5.3 shows the total CO₂ emissions in Liepāja city from 2006 to 2022. Since 2006, CO₂ emissions have decreased by 45% and in 2022 they amounted to 137 940 tCO₂. The achieved reduction in CO₂ emissions is due to the implementation of fuel switch and energy efficiency measures in the district heating sector. As already mentioned above, Liepāja has also renovated most of its municipal buildings and carried out a number of other measures.

A-2.2: Description &amp; assessment of policies

## European Union and global politics:

In 2015, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which sets out 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 sub-goals to be achieved in order to reduce global poverty and make global development more sustainable (see Figure 1.1). The inclusion of these goals is also important for the future development of the City of Liepāja in the areas of energy and climate change adaptation.

## European Union and global politics: energy and climate mitigation

To achieve these goals, the European Union (EU) strategy "European Green Deal" was adopted on 11 December 2019, setting out the main orientations for EU climate and energy policy.

At EU level, energy policy for the period up to 2050 is set out in the EC declaration "Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050". For the period up to 2030, energy policy is set out in the EC declaration "Clean energy for all Europeans".

The European Climate Law sets a headline target for 2050 to achieve climate neutrality at EU level and increase the GHG reduction target for 2030. In addition, on 14 July 2021, the European Commission launched the "Fit for 55" package to align existing European climate policy with the new headline targets, as every legislative proposal and planned action needs to comply with the "green oath: do no harm", i.e. a commitment that no planned action will harm (but preferably - will contribute to) the Green Deal objectives.

The EU's energy efficiency targets are set out in Directive 2023/1791 of the European Parliament and the Council, which also specifies measures to be taken at the national level. The directive was developed in 2012 (initially numbered as 2012/27/EU) and revised in 2023. According to the new directive, member states collectively must ensure a reduction in final energy consumption of at least 11.7% by 2030 compared to 2020.

The revised directive further strengthens the exemplary role of the public sector in improving energy efficiency practices. The directive sets an annual target of a 1.9% reduction in energy consumption for the entire public sector. Additionally, an annual 3% obligation for building renovations applies to all levels of government. In addition to its obligations, the public sector will play a leading role in the development of the energy efficiency services market. Priority will be given to energy efficiency projects in the public sector when entering into energy performance contracts whenever possible. When making procurement decisions, government authorities will continue to consider energy efficiency requirements, promoting systematic improvements.

Furthermore, countries are compelled to prioritise energy efficiency improvements for vulnerable consumers, households with low incomes, and individuals in social housing.

## European Union and global politics: adaptation to climate change

On 24 February 2021, the European Commission adopted the new European Union strategy for adapting to climate change. The strategy sets out how the EU can adapt to the unavoidable consequences of climate change and become resilient by 2050.

At municipal level, the development of the energy sector and the mitigation of climate impacts are promoted by the Covenant of Mayors initiative, which started in 2008 after the adoption of the EU climate and energy package. In 2014, the Mayors Adapt initiative was launched to promote and support municipal adaptation to climate change. In 2015, these two initiatives were merged into one initiative called the "Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy".

## National policy: energy and climate mitigation

The State's supreme national long-term development planning document, "Sustainable Development Strategy of Latvia until 2030", sets as a key objective in the energy sector to ensure energy independence by increasing energy self-sufficiency and integrating into EU energy networks.

The State's supreme national medium-term development planning document, the National Development Plan of Latvia for 2021-2027, sets out key priorities, including "Nature and Environment – A Green Deal".

Its main objectives are to move towards low-carbon, resource-efficient and climate-resilient development, as well as biodiversity conservation.

The Cabinet of Ministers approved the planning document "National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030" (NECP2030) by its Order No 46 of 4 February 2020. According to NECP2030: The long-term vision of the Plan is to contribute to the development of a sustainable economy in a sustainable, competitive and secure manner.

In 2023, the new Directive 2023/1791 on energy efficiency was revised and adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, establishing more ambitious goals for the reduction of energy consumption. Member states, including Latvia, are obligated to update their National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs), specifying indicative national contributions and trajectories towards achieving the set targets. The final version of the updated plan must be submitted by June 2024.

In line with Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy efficiency, a long-term strategy for the renovation of buildings was developed in 2017 and revised in 2020. The aim of the strategy is to mobilise investment in the renovation of both public and private stock of residential buildings and commercial premises.

On 28 May 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers reviewed and approved the information report of the Ministry of Economics "Long-Term Energy Strategy of Latvia 2030 -

Competitive Energy for the Society". The Strategy is designed to offer a new energy policy scenario that not only focuses on the development of the energy sector, but also views it in the context of climate policy - the EU's binding framework for reducing GHG emissions.

On 28 January 2020, the Cabinet of Ministers examined the informational report "Latvia's Strategy to achieve climate neutrality by 2050" elaborated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development, which is a long-term policy planning document to be implemented by horizontally integrating GHG and climate resilience targets in all sectors of the economy. The overarching objective of the Strategy is to achieve climate neutrality for Latvia in 2050.

Latvia's indicative target under Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy efficiency and the other requirements of the Directive have been incorporated into the Energy Efficiency Law, which entered into force on 29 March 2016. The Energy Efficiency Law will be revised in line with the European Parliament and Council Directive 2023/1791 on energy efficiency and the updated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) for 2030. Article 5 of the Law on Energy Efficiency in the State and Local Government Sector sets out the following rights and obligations that apply to the Liepāja City Municipality:

) State institutions, municipalities and other derived public persons shall have the right:

a. develop and adopt an energy efficiency plan as a stand-alone document or as part of the municipal spatial development programme, which includes defined energy efficiency targets and improvement measures;
b. implement an energy management system, either separately or as part of the implementation of its energy efficiency plan;
c. use energy efficiency services and energy efficiency service contracts to implement energy efficiency improvement measures.

) National municipalities implement and maintain a certified energy management system.

) A state authority, municipality or other derived public body that has implemented an energy management system shall inform the responsible authority annually of the energy savings resulting from the operation of the energy management system. The procedure for reporting energy savings achieved after the implementation of an energy management system by a public body, municipality or other public derivative entity shall be determined by the Cabinet of Ministers.

) When assessing projects which will be implemented in whole or in part through payments from the state budget, state guarantees, interest rate subsidies on loans or other financial assistance granted or provided from state or European Union budget funds and foreign financial assistance funds, public authorities, municipalities and other public derivative entities which have implemented an energy management system, the maximum number of points to be obtained

according to the quality assessment criteria shall be increased, following the procedure laid down in the regulatory act on granting the relevant funding.

The provisions of the Law on the Energy Performance of Buildings derive from Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy efficiency of buildings. The aim of this law is to promote the rational use of energy resources by improving the energy performance of buildings and by informing the public about the energy consumption of buildings.

Another important aspect to consider in the energy and climate fields is energy poverty. The Energy Law defines energy poverty as "the inability of a household user to maintain an adequate temperature in the home or to use or pay for services provided by energy utilities because of low energy efficiency or because the payment for these services is a high proportion of the household income". The National Energy and Climate Plan of Latvia sets a target of reducing energy poverty in Latvia below the EU average by 2030, i.e. to reach below 7.5% by 2030.

## National policy: adaptation to climate change

In the State's supreme national long-term development planning document, "Sustainable Development Strategy of Latvia until 2030", climate change is identified as one of the most important challenges related to global processes, affecting the economy and ecosystems, ecosystem services, natural and human capital. The Strategy highlights in particular coastal erosion and sand accumulation processes along the Baltic Sea coast in relation to climate change risks.

The National Development Plan of Latvia for 2021-2027 sets as one of its action objectives to mitigate the impacts of climate change by implementing climate change adaptation measures, achieving improvements in physical and infrastructure provision in the management of economic sectors, and sustainable management of rainwater, taking into account the latest scientific data and projections on achieving and strengthening climate resilience.

On 17 July 2019, Latvian National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change until 2030 was approved. The plan sets out potential climate adaptation actions for local governments, including:

) integrate climate change, mitigation and adaptation considerations into the preparation and updating of spatial development planning and sectoral policy documents at all levels;
) ensure that detailed actions and necessary adaptation measures are included in the development programmes of municipalities.

On 31 August 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the planning document "Environmental Policy Guidelines 2021-2027" (EPG2027) by Order No 583, with the main sub-objectives to ensure progress towards climate neutrality and to promote climate resilience and adaptation to climate change. The EPG2027 requires that by 2027 all municipalities should have developed and fully or partially implemented municipal climate change adaptation strategies.

## Regional framework

At the regional level, the supreme long-term development planning document is the Sustainable Development Strategy of Kurzeme Planning Region (KPR) 2030, which defines the KPR as a smart, creative, green, internationally competitive and attractive region on the Baltic Sea coast. One of the aspects highlighted in the development vision is "Ecologically based thinking and actions make Kurzeme an outpost of green economy in Latvia and the Baltic Sea Region". One of the long-term priorities of the Sustainable Development Strategy of KPR 2030 is the efficient use of resources.

## Liepāja City Municipality development planning documents

The vision of the Sustainable Development Strategy of the City of Liepāja and the South Kurzeme Region until 2035 is "Liepāja - an internationally recognised, green and smart port city on the Baltic Sea coast", while the strategic goal is "An achievable and smartly managed economically active environment in sustainable natural and human harmony on the Baltic Sea coast".

The Liepāja City and South Kurzeme Region Development Program 2022-2027 sets out the courses of action to achieve the long-term objectives and priorities.

In order to assess the current air quality situation in Liepāja and to plan measures to improve air quality, the Liepāja City Action Programme for Improving Air Quality 2021-2025 has been developed. According to the measurements carried out within the framework of the programme, the current situation does not

Residual emissions consist of those emissions which can't be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emission may amount to a maximum of 20 % as stated by the Mission Info Kit.
Baseline reduction target = Baseline emissions – residual emissions.
Emission reductions planned for in existing action planning and strategies should be quantified per sector.
Emissions gap = Baseline emission reduction target – Emissions reduction in existing strategies.

In 2020, on March 19, the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan for the city of Liepāja for the period 2020-2030 was approved. The plan established the goal to stabilize the city's CO2 emissions at a level 45% lower than in 2006 by the year 2030.

The challenge may arise from insufficient information regarding the expected emission reductions associated with the identified policies and regulations, coupled with a lack of standardised methodologies for quantifying such reductions.

While Table A-2.3 indicate reductions in existing strategies and a gap equal to the target, it's important to consider the comprehensive nature of this Action Plan. One important part is in section B-2.1 which provides detailed information on action portfolios, and within the Action Plan, there are explicit efforts outlined in other sections to change policies in order to reduce the emissions gap.

Moreover, it's crucial to recognise the collaborative role of the European Commission and NetZeroCities in facilitating communication with national governments regarding policy changes. In many instances, municipalities face limitations in implementing certain changes without the active involvement and support of the national government. European Commission, along with NetZeroCities, should play a pivotal role in advocating for environmentally friendly policies at higher levels of governance that leads to reduce emissions gap.

Infrastructure resilience
Integration of adaptation aspects into all aspects of urban planning
Prioritisation of nature-based solutions

In conclusion, the city of Liepāja has developed a comprehensive and focused strategy for climate mitigation and adaptation, targeting six key sectors. The plan encompasses a wide range of measures, from improving energy efficiency in municipal infrastructure to promoting sustainable transport solutions, embracing renewable energy sources, enhancing housing renovation, and adapting to climate change. Each sector is confronted with specific challenges that highlight the complexity of the city's transition. These challenges include issues such as 100% green electricity consumption, cost-effective vehicle replacement, changing commuting habits, and ensuring the resilience of infrastructure under extreme conditions. The plan not only addresses technical and operational aspects but also emphasises the need for behavioral changes, stakeholder involvement, and the consideration of socioeconomic factors. By delineating these challenges, Liepāja's Action Plan sets up approach for targeted interventions, fostering collaboration, innovation, and resilience in the face of climate change.

## A-3.3: Description or visualisation of participatory model for the city climate neutrality – textual and visual elements

In order to achieve the goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2030, the involvement of all groups of society will be more intensive than it has been up to now. In each of the sectors included in the plan, there are certain CO₂ reduction targets for which the Management and Monitoring Group will be responsible for the overall achievement, and for the sub-sectors, the local government commissions or groups responsible.

Until now, the Energy Task Force has been responsible for achieving the CO₂ emissions targets in Liepāja, but in view of the fact that the municipality will sign the Climate city agreement with more ambitious objectives, the organisational structure needs to be revised. The general organizational scheme is given in Figure A-3.3.1.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure A-3.3.1: Structure of the Action Plan Working Group

Table A-3.3.1 summarises the main roles and responsibilities of all the commissions and groups involved.

Most of the commissions and groups listed in Table A-3.3.1. have already been established, but their mandate should be extended and the task of implementing measures included in SECAP2030, which will allow the municipality of Liepāja to achieve the objective of climate neutrality. A number of groups will need to be re-established and their potential composition is listed below:

Management and Monitoring Group: City Council Chairman and his deputy(-ies), Executive Director, two Deputy Executive Directors, Liepājas Special Economic Zone Manager, Chairman of «Liepājas
Liepāja

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

enerģija» Ltd, Executive director's Advisor on IT and Smart Digital Solutions, project manager (climate change and energy efficiency);

Energy Efficiency Group: Deputy Executive Director for Property, Head of the Municipal Administration, Head of Development Administration, Head of Environment Division, Head of Construction Board;
Environmental Communication Group: Head of Education Management, Head of Public Relations and Marketing, Non-Governmental Organisations;
CCC Group: Project Manager (Climate Change and Energy Efficiency), Deputy Head of Development Management, Project Manager of the Development Administration Project Enforcement Division, Senior Environment Protection Officer, Head of IT Division IT Services Management.

These committees, integral to the municipal structure, fall under the oversight of the Liepāja Central administration. Recognising the pivotal role they play in implementing identified actions, a comprehensive set of guidelines will be outlined. This framework will meticulously define the authority, functions, and reporting mechanisms for each committee, elucidating their roles and responsibilities. Emphasizing transparency and accountability, this approach seeks to establish clear communication channels and collaborative processes between the committees and the Liepāja Central administration. By refining the delineation of authority and responsibilities, we aim to fortify the effective functioning of these committees within the municipal framework, ensuring their alignment with overarching policy goals.

Roles and responsibilities of groups and commissions also are described and connected to each activity in action portfolio.

It will be very important to develop feedback and cooperation with the CCC group in the organisational structure, which will be the responsible unit for assessing how CO₂ emissions are changing in Liepāja and how it moves towards climate neutrality. The existing and newly established groups are within the framework of Liepāja Central administration and fall under its responsibility.

It is important not only to improve and strengthen the organisational structure of the municipality in order to achieve the objectives, but to involve all stakeholders. The local government of Liepājas will not be able to achieve climate neutrality objectives without extensive involvement of all groups of society. Figure A-3.3.2 identifies the main stakeholders, taking into account their interest and influence in achieving climate neutrality objectives.

# Figure A-3.3.2: Mapping stakeholders to climate neutrality goals

Breakdown of the parties involved (Figure A-3.3.2):

The red-coloured schedule identifies those parties who decide and/or may influence decisions at political level, including the necessary changes to the regulatory framework.
The green colors include those local government organisations and departments responsible for one of the sectors included in the plan, such as « Liepājas energija» Ltd, which are responsible for the DH sector.
Prange highlights a variety of population groups and they are separately divided according to a variety of conditions, such as car owners, apartment and private house owners. Each of these groups plays an important role and each of them must also put forward certain measures.
Dark grey identifies industrial companies and service providers.
Blue - NGO and other organisations.

As regards the involvement of stakeholders, at least the following key challenges have been identified:

Involvement of stakeholders in public processes, including climate neutrality and the introduction of measures.
Low support at national level to introduce effective policies and measures at local level to achieve climate neutrality in some sectors.
Lack of funding to ensure investment in all planned measures to achieve climate neutrality.

The involvement of each of the parties involved will require targeted measures. The organisations mentioned in Figure A-3.3.1 will be responsible for their implementation. For the involvement of the Parties, the municipality will use these and other methods used by the other 100 NetZeroCities municipalities in Europe:

Targeted surveys to identify the needs of target groups and the necessary support and/or incentive mechanisms, such as the abandonment or replacement of vehicle owners to a more environmentally friendly vehicle.
Regular thematic discussions using, for example, a design thinking approach to involve target groups in the implementation of measures.
Information and support measures such as Energy Efficiency Week, European Mobility Week, etc.
Sharing good practice examples such as the introduction of nature-based solutions more broadly.

Alignment and coherence between the public engagement narrative and the public-led action plan

Similarly, there are plans to actively engage the community in improving and supplementing SECAP and CCC, as well as implementing various activities. Some of these measures include hackathons organised by the Education Administration on the development of smart urban environments, digitalisation, and other topics, surveys of residents on climate change and mobility, seminars on energy efficiency, and more. It should be noted that not only the municipality and its capital companies are involved in informing and engaging the public but also NGOs (including through funding competitions announced by the municipality), Liepāja University, LSEZ, and other companies. One of the main tasks in this part is to attract finances for public campaigns focusing on climate change, mobility, adaptation etc.

Furthermore, in the Latvian context, a notable cultural barrier exists, wherein individuals exhibit a marked resistance to change and a reluctance to actively participate in the development of pivotal documents. This cultural trait sharply contrasts with the societal norms prevalent in Western Europe, where a greater predisposition toward adaptability and open communication is observed. Also cultural trait about resistance to change, rooted in the historical context of Soviet occupation, presents a significant challenge. The resistance to changes and improvements is slowly fading away, and there's hope that situation with this tough barrier will keep getting better with each new generation.

# Just transition

An important aspect we're examining is how inclusive and accessible the development process of the Action Plan is for all members of the community. We aim to identify any efforts made to remove obstacles for the involvement of marginalised groups.
Liepāja

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Liepāja embraces the principle of "just transition" as a guiding force in its commitment to climate action. Recognising the importance of fairness and inclusivity, we strive to ensure that CCC activities are navigated in a socially equitable manner. While our commitment to "just transition" is firm, we acknowledge the need to elaborate on its practical implementation within the commitments document.

Liepāja Central administration is already involving marginalised communities in discussions for specifically tailored needs and it covers all topics not only climate change mitigation.

Here is some information about the ongoing programs and support opportunities offered by Liepāja municipality:

Liepāja municipality runs financial support competitions for various sectors. These competitions likely provide funding to initiatives or projects in different areas, contributing to the development and wellbeing of the community.
The mayor, along with other specialists, actively engages with citizens by visiting every local community. This direct interaction is a valuable approach to understanding the needs, concerns, and aspirations of the residents, fostering a sense of community involvement and collaboration.
For economically vulnerable residents in Liepāja, the municipality offers a range of support options, including:

One-time health care allowance annually.
70% reduction in property tax.
50% reduction in meal costs in preschool educational institutions.
100% reduction in meal costs in general education schools.
Municipal assistance in resolving housing issues.
State-provided legal aid.
Exemption from co-payment fees for students from low-income families in educational institutions implementing professional and interest-based education.
EU-funded food packages for those with incomes not exceeding 327 euros.

In order to promote citizen participation in the decision-making process, every interested party was invited to express their opinion on the draft binding regulations "On the income threshold for low-income households in the Liepāja City Municipality". The objective of the binding regulations "On the income threshold for low-income households in the Liepāja City Municipality" is to establish the income threshold for low-income households. These binding regulations are essential to enable more residents with low incomes to qualify for municipal social benefits.

These support measures cover a wide spectrum, addressing health, housing, education, and legal needs of the residents, particularly focusing on those facing financial challenges. They demonstrate the municipality's commitment to social welfare and inclusivity, creating a safety net for vulnerable populations.

In the context of citizen engagement, we are dedicated to be more accessible for the participation of marginalised groups in the development of the participation budget. We recognise that inclusivity is paramount to the success of our climate initiatives, and we aim to actively involve all segments of society, particularly those facing challenges.

Our commitment goes beyond acknowledgment, as we provide specific details on initiatives and strategies designed to foster inclusivity. We understand the importance of ensuring that everyone in our community has a meaningful role in shaping Liepāja's sustainable and climate-resilient future.

Moving forward, we are going to provide more explicit details on how the principle of "just transition" is practically implemented in our climate action initiatives. We will try to transparently report on the measures taken to lower barriers for marginalised groups and ensure their active participation in shaping the trajectory of our city's sustainable future.

## Demographic data
Liepāja

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

To enrich the depth and inclusivity of CCC, we recognise the significance of integrating demographic data. While the plan also acknowledges specific societal groups, we commit to refining our engagement strategy by harnessing the insights provided by demographic information.

Understanding the nuanced composition of our community is pivotal in tailoring our outreach efforts to address the distinct needs and challenges faced by various demographic segments. This data-driven approach serves several purposes.

This extends to customising our broader engagement strategies. Events, platforms, and outreach methods will be adapted to suit the unique characteristics and preferences of different demographic groups. In doing so, we aspire to create an environment that is not only accessible but also relatable for all community members.

Crucially, by incorporating demographic data, we commit to addressing participation barriers. This involves proactive measures based on identified demographic trends, ensuring that our engagement initiatives are not only diverse but also accessible to every citizen.

In our ongoing commitment to inclusivity, Liepāja Central administration Development department is already actively implementing regular updates to demographic data across various documents. This established practice is integral to our monitoring and evaluation process, providing an iterative approach to track changes over time and assess the effectiveness of our engagement strategies. In Figures A-3.3.3 till A-3.3.6 can be seen some of the demographic data in Liepāja.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways–textual and visual elements

The city of Liepāja aims to achieve climate neutral status by 2030, i.e. to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by $80\%$ compared to 2006. However, it is important to acknowledge that the successful attainment of these goals for the City of Liepāja depends on navigating and mitigating a multitude of external factors, some of which may be beyond the direct control of the city.

The City of Liepāja's vision and key actions to 2030 are summarised in Figure B-1.2.1. In order to achieve $80\%$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent emission reductions, the figure identifies the key sectors where these reductions can be achieved and to what extent, and lists the key measures. Around the center it can be seen how this target ($80\%$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent emission reductions) is divided by sectors (target = sectors summed $(100\%)$).

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

# Integration and horizontal aspects

To achieve climate neutrality, the following horizontal aspects will be taken into account and integrated throughout the planning and implementation process:
Liepāja

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Closer cooperation with all stakeholders, including industry, service providers, NGOs, citizens and others.
Principles such as "energy efficiency first", "green procurement", "innovative financial instruments" will be integrated throughout the policy planning and implementation chain, not only in the municipality, but also much more widely, e.g. in industry, etc.
The advantages and disadvantages of future policies and measures will be assessed from environmental, social, economic, financial and other perspectives.
A cross-sectoral approach will be ensured in all planning, implementation and monitoring processes.

Liepāja city values in its robust citizen engagement efforts, exemplified by the inclusive development of the Action Plan. Our commitment extends beyond this initiative, serving as a positive example for other municipalities. We have successfully incorporated citizen input into various decisions, rules, and regulations, showcasing a dedication to participatory governance and transparent decision-making. This experience positions Liepāja as a model for effective citizen engagement, contributing to the overall success of our municipality's initiatives.

In addition to CO₂ emission reduction targets, Liepāja sets quantitative and qualitative targets in the energy and climate change adaptation sectors, as well as for energy poverty reduction by 2030.

Energy poverty becomes an increasingly relevant issue every year. In Section 1 of the Energy Law, the following definition is provided: energy poverty - the inability of a household consumer to maintain an appropriate temperature in the dwelling or to use the services of energy suppliers provided services, or the settlement for them, may be affected by low energy efficiency or because the cost of these services constitutes a high proportion of household income. So far, at the municipal (and also national) level, the number of energy-poor households has not been specified; therefore, the baseline value is determined according to Sections 120 and 121 of the Energy Law, which, according to data from the Social Service of the Liepāja City Council, is 6.6% (national planning documents set a target level of 7.5%). However, it should be noted that the definition of energy poverty is broader and includes those residents who are not registered as needy or low-income and do not use municipal social assistance but still face difficulties in paying bills for the received energy or, for the purpose of savings, maintain the temperature in the dwelling significantly below the comfort level.

Objectives for reducing energy poverty: 1) Thoroughly assess and identify the groups of energy-poor residents in the city of Liepāja and specify their proportion; 2) Develop and implement tools to reduce energy poverty in the city of Liepāja; 3) Ensure that the level of energy poverty does not exceed the existing (6.6%) threshold in the city of Liepāja.

This issue becomes particularly significant when residents need to make a collective decision on the renovation of multi-apartment buildings. Often, during the building renovation process, the less affluent groups of residents are those who, due to financial reasons, are reluctant to support such projects, and as a result, they are not implemented, affecting not only themselves but also the well-being and energy payments of other residents. The goals for reducing energy poverty are summarized in Table 2.7.

Measures to mitigate and adapt to climate impacts in the city of Liepāja are focused on six main focus groups (see Figure B-1.2.2. and Figure B-1.2.3.):

In the municipal infrastructure, a set of measures is included that address issues related to the rational use of energy in municipal buildings, street lighting, and municipal transport.
In the housing sector, measures for housing renovation and broader energy efficiency are included.
In the transport and mobility section, planned measures will promote sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation usage and solutions in the municipal territory.
The DH energy production sector includes measures aimed at transitioning to RES and attracting new consumers.
In the manufacturing and services sector, measures are included to increase the energy efficiency of businesses and transition to RES.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

In the climate change adaptation field, measures are planned to enhance the municipality's resilience to climate change, including initiatives that promote nature-based solutions and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  sequestration.

# Priorities

We were the first municipality in Latvia to implement an energy management system

Among the state cities in Latvia, our city stands at the forefront in the renovation of public and multi-apartment housing

However, it's not just about being the first, it's about achieving substantial results because we believe in the impact it can make

We set the main project headlines as - ensure safe environment, care for people's health, and create comfortable living

Strategic priorities – promote the use of environmentally friendly means of mobility, energy efficiency first, digitalisation, RES usage, adaption to climate change and public education

# Milestones

We have developed a system with 111 indicators to check if we are reaching this milestone in year 2030 or not. "Figure 1: Liepāja's roadmap to climate neutrality" shows our way and milestones in this project. Every year we update our CCC and try to set milestones for each activity more precisely.

# Timeline

In "Figure B-1.2.2.: CO2 emission reductions and key actions of the SECAP focus groups" it can be seen the timeline and priorities of our activities. Figure B-1.2.2 summarises the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions of year 2022 and projected emissions of year 2030 for each sector and identifies the key actions to achieve reductions, while Figure B-1.2.3 also lists the first actions for each measure.

B-2.2: Individual action outlines

|  Action outline | Action name | Transition to 100% renewable energy in DH  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Long-term  |
|   |  Action description | "Liepājas enerģija" Ltd is a private equity company preparing a business plan until 2030. Taking into account that the share of natural gas boiler houses in the district heating system of Liepāja is still relatively high and that the demand for heat energy will decrease in the coming years as buildings will be increasingly insulated, it is necessary to develop a long-term concept for the district heating system, assessing various alternatives for the wider use of renewable energy sources in the district heating system, with the aim of producing 100% energy from RES in 2030. EU policy in the sustainable energy sector is strongly oriented towards reducing energy consumption and increasing the use of renewable energy sources, with funding also earmarked for these measures. Liepājas enerģija needs to anticipate the impact of existing and planned legislation and its future business model in order to be able to provide energy at a competitive price in the long term. It is necessary to develop energy efficiency measures and monitoring plan in order to adequately prepare for and implement the targets set by the EU Energy Efficiency Directive.  |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Action type | Long-term |
| Action description | In 2022, natural gas consumption accounted for 26% of the city's total CO₂ emissions. In the future, it is necessary to encourage these natural gas consumers to connect to DH.
In the future, along with energy efficiency projects that will contribute to the reduction of natural gas consumption, it is necessary to find solutions to attract new consumers to the DH. This measure should also be considered in the long-term concept of the district heating system.
However, it is not always economically viable to add new consumers to an existing heating system. In such cases, municipalities can use indicators to make an initial decision on further research. In practice, two indicators are used for the planning of district heating systems:
• heat load density (which should be at least 1.05 MW/km);
• heat density (target: 2,5 MWh/m).
The main objective of the measure is to promote and ensure cost-effective connection of new heat consumers to the existing heat supply networks in all settlements.
The aim of “Liepājas enerģija” customer service is to connect new objects every year, ensuring an annual heat sales of at least 200 GWh. The connection of new facilities shall at least compensate for the decrease in heat consumption of customers as a result of energy efficiency measures and possible climate change during the business plan period.
In addition, as part of this measure, “Liepājas enerģija” Ltd in cooperation with the Liepāja State City Administration is to develop an action plan to ensure the connection of customers to the DH who have been disconnected in recent years. This is particularly important to ensure that the existing heating system is not dismantled and that apartment owners do not install individual heating solutions that have not been approved by the Construction Board, which will affect the long-term safety of the building.
By 2030, natural gas consumption will be reduced by connecting 50% of households and utility users and 40% of service and industrial users to DH. |

|   |  Action description | Increasing the use of RES in heat generation is an effective way to reduce CO2 emissions in cities. Before installing RES equipment, the heat consumption of the building must be reduced as much as possible, increasing the energy efficiency of the building. The remaining uninsulated municipal and capital company buildings will be subject to energy efficiency improvement measures. Procurements should not only include an energy performance guarantee, but also a number of other preconditions for the successful implementation of the building renovation project and the management of the building after renovation, such as a single control system for all equipment. In addition, the ventilation systems (or lack thereof) and management of municipal institutions, in particular educational institutions, should be assessed. Both renovated and non-renovated buildings should be assessed and the results included in future renovation projects. In the future, when renovating municipal buildings, but in particular educational establishments, the municipality should foresee and include the construction and installation of ventilation systems in the technical design. Regardless of the renovation projects, the municipality should consider installing RES equipment or connecting to DH those buildings that are currently heated by individual natural gas boilers. By 2030, 50% of the municipality's an capital company buildings will have converted to RES for heat production or will be connected to CH.  |

|  Action outline | Action name | Green renewable electricity municipal infrastructure  |
|   |  Action type | Long-term  |
|   |  Action description | A high potential for reducing CO2 emissions is the production of electricity from RES, which would cover the electricity consumption of both municipal buildings and street lighting. The municipality should consider installing RES equipment or introducing a CO2 offsetting mechanism, e.g. by purchasing renewable electricity with zero CO2 emissions.
Often it is in municipal buildings, where offices are located, that energy consumption occurs during daylight hours, which is also when the solar energy potential is highest, allowing solar energy to be captured and used for self-consumption. There are a large number of municipal buildings in the city of Liepāja where the potential for deploying solar systems should be determined.
Solar energy projects can be implemented not only for municipal buildings, but also for street lighting and water management. In both sectors, energy efficiency measures should be taken first to minimise electricity consumption.
By 2030, all electricity consumed by municipal institutions and street lighting will be generated from RES.
Similarly, depending on the relevant Cabinet of Ministers regulations, a municipal energy community must be established, ensuring electricity supply for buildings, processes, lighting, transportation, etc. The operation of  |
|   |   |  the production of electricity is a key step in the development of a municipal energy system. The municipal energy community should be able to implement the energy efficiency measures in a real-time manner.  |

|   |  | In 2022, 30 municipal authorities owned vehicles. Their total fuel consumption was 81% diesel and 19% petrol, with emissions of 762 tCO2 in 2022. In order to reduce emissions from municipal transport, it is necessary to understand and change the daily commuting habits of municipal authorities and their employees. It is not only about understanding what means of transport employees currently use, but also what stops them from using a more environmentally friendly option, such as walking or cycling. This includes looking at the situation with bicycle parking outside municipal buildings. Once the situation is understood, improvements should be made, such as ensuring that every municipal building has a bicycle rack. Employees who live in close proximity and travel in the same direction should be encouraged or incentivised to carpool. By improving the e-services offered by the municipality and enabling employees to work remotely, the need for them to travel can be reduced. Moving towards climate neutrality requires increasing the share of environmentally friendly vehicles in the municipal fleet. The procurement of new vehicles and/or the assessment of the need and use of existing vehicles should further identify opportunities for the purchase of electric or other more environmentally friendly vehicles. By 2030, Liepāja City Municipality plans to provide the entire municipal fleet with electricity (if feasible). When procuring vehicles, consider options for shared use among administrative units and institutions. Innovations and technologies Continue to utilise and introduce other environmentally friendly and innovative services in areas such as waste collection, street and beach cleaning, watering of green spaces, etc. To test various innovative solutions in the city, it would be necessary to identify suitable locations and establish pilot areas. Therefore, one of the priorities should be the creation of such areas. In municipal operations, when purchasing new equipment, for example, landscaping and maintenance, explore the possibility of acquiring electrically powered and environmentally friendly equipment.  |

Given that the municipality is planning to introduce various measures to promote mobility and environmentally friendly travel, it is also important to inform both residents and visitors at the same time. The municipality can do this through information campaigns, which can be organised in cooperation with partners including Elektrum, electric car dealers, Latvian Railways, neighbouring municipalities, MEPRD, tourism organisations, local businesses, etc. Digital twin One of the smart city plans is to establish a real-time visualization of the city, allowing tracking of air quality, traffic flows, ongoing construction works, building energy efficiency levels, and other parameters. This would aid in forecasting urban development, making data-driven long-term decisions, saving finances and resources, and responding more promptly to issues. Any resident could monitor the current situation, fostering a responsible attitude towards the city's ongoing developments. Moving forward, decision-making and budgeting should also align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Green Deal objectives. Until now, criteria such as compliance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, impact on climate and the environment, public health, etc., have not been adequately considered in budgeting, decision-making, and the development of binding documents. Similarly, the carbon footprint left by various activities, such as infrastructure construction, maintenance services, or event organising, has not been sufficiently taken into account. |

|   |  Action description | In 2022, the manufacturing and services sector consumed 110 GWh of natural gas, which emitted 22 ktCO₂. This represents 16% of the city's total energy consumption and 19% of the city's total CO₂ emissions. This means that this sector is key to the city's climate sustainability.

Businesses need to assess their current level of energy efficiency and define measures to improve it. All companies included in the list of large companies or large electricity consumers are required by the Energy Efficiency Law to carry out an annual energy audit or to implement a certified energy management system or an environmental management system with an addendum. Such measures are desirable for any enterprise in the City of Liepāja with the potential to improve its energy efficiency.

By 2030, natural gas consumption in the manufacturing and service sectors will be reduced by 10% through energy efficiency measures.

Once energy consumption has been reduced as much as possible, consideration should be given to the possibility of connecting to DH or switching to RES.  |

The aim of the municipality is to provide convenient solutions for residents and visitors when transferring from car/van to train/bus and vice versa. Thus, within the framework of this measure, a mobility plan for Liepāja and the Dienvidkurzeme municipality will be developed, covering the following aspects:

• Analyse the existing situation, taking into account information on traffic and road conditions. This includes monitoring of traffic volumes.
• Determine the most efficient means of travel between the city and nearby settlements.
• Develop transport development alternatives, including:
o Access to, organisation, optimisation, modernisation and promotion of public transport;
o Development of micro-mobility infrastructure, (including mobility points);
o Electromobility;
o Improving traffic flow through traffic light efficiency solutions;
o Improving road quality;
o Develop a study on the use of parking spaces in Liepāja;
o Development of guidelines for traffic safety and calming solutions;
o Measures to promote teleworking and increase access to e-services;
o Information campaign on environmentally friendly mobility, including the development of an informative and interactive platform on different mobility options and appropriate routes;
o Enhancing city's mobile application with information on various mobility options and corresponding routes.
o Placing tourism navigation signs for motorists based on the "Tourism Information and Navigation Sign Placement Strategic Plan and Design"

The main objective of the event is to make environmentally friendly commuting a key priority for the development of the city's transport sector and urban planning.

Low emission zones

Low emission zones in the city can be introduced to improve air quality and reduce the negative impact on the environment and public health. Such zones help decrease emissions from transportation. The establishment of zones should be planned considering the current and projected levels of air pollution. To prepare for and create low emission zones, the following measures can be taken:

• Initially, drivers of certain vehicles could be informed in some way that entering with such a vehicle contributes to increased pollution and negatively affects human health.  |

|  Action description | According to the Local Government Law (amendments in force from 01.01.2023), one of the functions of a municipality is to organise public transport services. In order to reduce the use of private vehicles, the municipality must provide citizens with alternative mobility solutions, including high-quality and efficient public transport.
Liepāja has an extensive public transport system covering most of the city. Public transport plays an important role in the life of the city. Its increased use reduces air pollution, noise and environmental impact, as residents and visitors can use their private transport less. At the same time, the public transport system must meet the mobility requirements of society.
The mobility plan will be developed by identifying the commuting habits of the population. An in-depth assessment of the city's public transport services will also be carried out, assessing accessibility, efficiency and citizen satisfaction. This will be followed by improving the accessibility of public transport, improving the quality of the public transport service and modernising the rolling stock. As well as future projections of potential changes in the number of public transport users and the provision of existing infrastructure. A review and optimisation of the public transport route network in line with demand and urban development trends will be continued to carry out to reduce duplication of routes, public transport mileage and fleet.
Liepāja's main streets are already one-way, and several smart traffic lights have been installed. One of the measures would be to create a "green" wave in the city. This would include at least the following actions:
• A study on the mobility of people during the daily season.
• Adaptation of the existing traffic light system to the results of the study.  |   |

As the latest technologies allow the use of biomethane from waste production for transport, this option is relevant for Liepāja from a sustainability point of view. Other options would be to use compressed gas, hydrogen, hybrid or electric buses (battery).

In addition, the city should also plan for the extension of the tram network and provide a "green" corridor for trams, and further development of the single electronic settlement system.  |

|  Action outline | Action name | Development of micro-and-electrical mobility  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Short-term  |
|   |  Action description | One of the goals of the City of Liepāja is to provide its residents and visitors with convenient, fast and easy transport within the city at an attractive price. Thus, the development of electric bicycles is one of the medium-term development directions, which is also taking place in other European cities such as Tartu.

The main users of e-bikes would be students, residents of neighbourhoods and the city centre, commuters and visitors to the city.

• To successfully implement convenient, fast, and easy mobility, it would be necessary to implement at least the following activities: Limiting private traffic in the city centre;
• Speed reduction and experimental temporary closure of streets to traffic (or giving priority to pedestrians/cyclists);
• Identifying the needs of residents and visitors;
• Development of Park&Bike, including racks for all bicycles;
• introduction of bike-sharing services in the city;
• Linking with the public transport network and the possibility of a combined ticket;
• Developing cycling infrastructure (pavement quality, network);
• Service points in the city;
• Adapting the rules for the use of electric bicycles, electric scooters and electric cars to the needs of the city;
• solutions for secure bicycle storage in multi-apartment buildings or nearby.

In addition, the municipality sees the possibility of extending the electric bicycle system throughout the municipality, integrating it with public transport tickets.

Taking into account the development of electric transport, the development of convenient, well thought out and accessible electric charging stations at important sites in the city should be planned in cooperation with public authorities and other key stakeholders such as petrol station operators, shopping centres, etc. The possibility of technically linking charging stations to tram infrastructure should also be considered.  |

|   |  | In addition to this measure, cooperation should also be developed to take over or test the most successful solutions of Riga municipality in inter-city transportation efficiency. For the development of electricity charging infrastructure, the municipality of Liepājas State has developed a plan for the deployment of charging stations and organises auctions for the construction of charging stations. A map of electric car charging points is also available in the city's mobile app. Also, the use of various other innovative mobility solutions implemented by other cities and municipalities in Europe and elsewhere in the world should be further studied. By 2030, it is planned to reduce the use of private vehicles by 15 000 vehicles.  |

B-2.2: Individual action outlines

|  Action outline | Action name | Renovation of multi-apartment buildings  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Long-term  |
|   | Action description | In the city, a large number of residential buildings are apartment blocks that are deteriorating and reaching the end of their useful life and need to be renovated. Studies show that apartment buildings in Latvia are in need of comprehensive renovation. Based on the information provided by the Liepāja City Council, out of a total of about 600 apartment buildings to be renovated, 200 buildings will have been renovated by 2024.

In 2023, the pace of renovation of multi-apartment buildings has significantly decreased, including due to the interruption of the support program of the Ministry of Economy and the unattractive conditions. Although Liepāja has the largest proportion of renovated buildings compared to other national cities, its purpose does not end there. On the contrary, this process should be accelerated and promoted, which is why Liepāja is involved in the development of new national support mechanisms.

The municipality of Liepāja, in cooperation with building managers, energy efficiency service providers (ESKO), as well as financial institutions and other interested parties, discusses and offers solutions to the responsible ministry on how to jointly promote and achieve the renovation of apartment buildings and the reduction of energy consumption not only in the city, but throughout the country.

At the same time, the issue of how to provide residents with new, energy-efficient and comfortable housing, both as a low-rent option and for purchase, is being addressed.

A more in-depth analysis of the current situation of the city's apartment buildings is needed and the priority buildings that need to be renovated should be identified. Higher priority should be given to buildings with higher energy consumption and/or with a higher proportion of the population exposed to energy poverty.

Although there is a lot of information available on the internet and in local government, experience and research shows that people are more likely to trust and work with those from within their own communities or NGO. It is therefore important that the municipality has one such body/personnel or NGO to whom apartment owners can turn without having to call in outside consultants every time. The main issues that should be the responsibility of the body/personnel are:

• Information and advice on measures to reduce heat and electricity consumption in dwellings, and on the possibilities of receiving support for the use of RES technologies, in cooperation with proven experts and research institutions in Latvia.
• Information and advice on the renovation of multi-apartment buildings (including the establishment of associations, support for the preparation of  |

|   |  | documentation for project applications, support for the socially disadvantaged, etc.).
• Preparation and regular distribution of information material for residents, cooperation with building managers.
• Organisation of informational events.

While apartment buildings are the responsibility of the apartment owners, the municipality plays an important role in their renovation. The Liepāja City Municipality should consider opportunities to provide financial support, including:
• energy audits for multi-apartment dwellings
• technical inspection reports;
• construction projects.

In addition, the municipality should also look for instruments to motivate apartment owners not only with support instruments, but also with the obligation to clean up their homes (e.g. through binding regulations for buildings with consumption above 150 kWh/m² year). In addition, the municipality should also consider the impact of energy poverty and support for vulnerable groups.

buildings (35 buildings/year) are to be renovated by 2030.

In addition, the possibility of installing solar energy installations on the roofs of apartment buildings to generate electricity and heat should be considered, as well as support the preparation of a technical conclusion (also for only installation of solar panels).

Restoration of historical buildings
The municipality must continue to support the restoration of historical buildings  |

Awareness-raising events may include, for example, the organisation of an Energy Day and/or a Mobility Day in the municipality, as well as competitions and competitions for energy users. Events should be organised not only for adults, but also for schoolchildren and pre-school children. In order to more effectively involve citizens in the future, and not only those who are already interested in these topics, it is necessary to create a different approach to the event format. The municipality and other stakeholders should inform the public about the observance of circular economy principles in daily processes. Likewise, the local government should also try to comply with these principles and set an example of rational use of energy and resources, encourage residents of the neighborhood and tourists to get involved in solving environmental issues. The creation of the planned public participation budget and its connection with the goals of climate neutrality should also be taken into account.  |

In order to improve air quality as well as to ensure rational use of energy resources, the following actions should continue under this measure:
• The choice and adaptation of the specific solution in a centralised or decentralised manner;
• Use of the state support program to connect to DH or install RES mechanisms; The renovation of private houses;
• Advice and education.

## B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

Liepāja will achieve climate neutrality by 2030 by reducing CO₂ emissions by 80% compared to 2006 and sequestering the remaining 20% by implementing CO₂ sequestration measures. However, it is important to acknowledge that the successful attainment of these goals for the City of Liepāja depends on navigating and mitigating a multitude of external factors, some of which may be beyond the direct control of the city.

A study "Assessment, Projections and Proposals for the City of Liepāja Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions and Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) Sequestration" has been prepared for the City of Liepāja in 2023.

The study concluded that Liepāja's forests remain a source of CO₂ binding up to year 2050, including carbon accumulation in living and non-living woody biomass, while wood products are a minor source of emissions. CO₂ sequestration in Liepāja forests is expected to gradually decrease due to changes in the age structure of forests and an increase in the proportion of older stands. Currently, the City's forests can offset about 7% of cumulative GHG emissions, so additional measures will be introduced to achieve climate neutrality.

City's forests can provide small (on average 1.4 tonnes CO₂ eq ha-1 yr over 7-15 years) but significant GHG emission reductions by promoting climate change mitigation measures outside the city.

The most promising mitigation measures, which are not constrained by land availability or legislative restrictions, are afforestation, especially on organic soils, and the establishment of fast-growing tree plantations on agricultural land. To gradually offset all GHG emissions in the city, without taking into account GHG emission reductions from organic soils, 5,300 ha would need to be afforested and 1,800 ha would need to be reforested by afforestation of organic soils. Planting tree crops would require 3,500 ha. In addition, to gradually replace GHG emissions from deforestation, 0.3 thousand ha of mineral soils or 0.1 thousand ha of organic soils or 0.2 thousand ha of fast-growing tree plantations should be afforested by 2050.

It is necessary to promote the creation and development of green infrastructure, which includes both the creation of greenery in the urban environment, which creates shade, and other nature-based solutions.

The action will seek and assess the possibilities of increasing CO₂ emissions with new technologies and innovation, as well as their cost-effectiveness.

## 4.3 Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

Module B-3 "Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning" should contain a selection of indicators taken from the Comprehensive Indicator Sets developed by NZC. The following should be provided: An overview table listing the indicators selected per outcome and impact including targets and evaluation points (B-3.1); and a metadata table for each indicator selected, as specified in the Comprehensive Indicator Sets (B-3.2).

### Data sufficiency:

In terms of data sufficiency, Liepāja should make commendable efforts to gather comprehensive information across various fields of action related to climate change. The city should implement robust data collection mechanisms, involving both internal and external stakeholders. The finance department should also play a specific role in this process, analysing data to design climate budgeting decisions. The availability of sufficient and reliable data enhances the city's ability to monitor progress, assess the impact of interventions, and make informed adjustments to its climate policies.
Liepāja

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

Currently, Liepāja municipality employs a traditional data collection approach, primarily involving regular inquiries to essential entities such as the district heating company, electricity distribution operator, capital companies, and fuel and gas providers. The existing system aligns with the Covenant of Mayors template, and additional data on various indicators is obtained through surveys and specific infrastructure project results. While this method has been effective in generating relevant information, there is a recognition that the process could be further modernised. The municipality aspires to transition towards a more convenient and automated indicator monitoring and data gathering system in the future. This shift aims to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness in data collection, allowing for more dynamic and responsive decision-making processes.

## Plan monitoring and oversight:

Monitoring is a very important part of the implementation of the SECAP. Regular data collection and analysis allows to better track progress and determine whether the objectives will be achieved on time. Monitoring also provides feedback - plan implementers can assess whether the desired results of the implemented measures are being achieved and, if not, take preventive action.

Two types of monitoring of measures and actions can be distinguished in the framework of the SECAP:

Monthly monitoring activities under the EMS;
Annual monitoring activities relating to the monitoring of the other actions and targets included in the Action Plan.

The Management and Monitoring Group is responsible for the performance monitoring. The necessary monitoring data shall be prepared and submitted upon request by the responsible local government specialists/departments/organisations. In the Action Plan, the implementation process is assessed using the indicators set out in Table B-3.1.1. In addition, the organisation, management and social innovation intervention measures shall be monitored.

## Indicators fall into three categories:

Direct impact indicators (shown in Table B-3.1.1, shaded in dark orange)
Non-direct impact indicators.
Indicators for monitoring the implementation of the Plan:

The monitoring indicators for the measures listed in section B-2.2 are shown in Table B-3.1.1, coloured in light orange;
The monitoring indicators for the organisation, governance and social innovation interventions are listed in Table B-3.1.2.

Monitoring data shall be published on the Liepāja City website www.liepaja.lv. Monitoring of consumption data of municipal institutions should be carried out and published on a monthly basis in order to:

municipal employees are more motivated to pay attention to energy consumption;
the municipality sets an example for the citizens of the city.

It is desirable to publish data for apartment buildings as well as for the transport sector on an annual basis, so that citizens are also informed about the results achieved. Monitoring data can also be used to identify the winners of various competitions.

Based on the monitoring data, the energy savings and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission reduction targets set for the measures included in the SECAP should be reviewed annually and corrective action taken if necessary.

# 5 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C “Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030” aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e. with regard to organizational setting or collaborative governance models, or related to social innovations – designed to support and enable the climate action portfolios described in Module B-2 as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1).

## 5.1 Module C-1 Organisational and Governance Innovation Interventions

Module C-1 “Organisational and Governance Innovation Interventions” consists of a summary table, listing organizational and governance interventions and describing their impact (C-1.1) and a section for more detailed descriptions and comments (C-1.2).

|  C.1.1: Enabling organisational and governance interventions  |   |   |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Intervention name | Description | Responsible entity/ dept./ person | Involved stakeholder | Enabling impact | Co-benefits  |
|  CCC Working Group | Working group monitoring and coordinating the achievement of climate change objectives | Municipality of City of Liepāja | All groups specified in the organizational scheme | Ensure synergy with all working groups involved in the process and the Management and Monitoring Group | Allow systematic implementation of energy and climate measures in Liepāja  |
|  Cooperation with the parties concerned | Develop cooperation with external stakeholders | Environmental Communication Group | NGOs, entrepreneurs, service providers, residents, etc. | Networking is critical to the achievement of the objectives pursued by the city | Increase in innovative solutions, examples of good practices, etc.  |

Roles and responsibilities of commissions and groups involved in the organisational structure is already described in section A-3.3.

## C-1.2: Description of organisation and governance interventions – textual and visual elements

**Management and Monitoring Group (Newly formed)**

The Management and Monitoring Group assumes a critical role in overseeing the SECAP2030 and CCC measures. Comprising key stakeholders, including the City council chairman, Executive director, and other relevant authorities, this group will foster cooperation with Riga municipality and state institutions. Emphasis is placed on decision-making and monitoring measures within the district heating sector, a vital component of Liepāja's climate action plan.

**Energy Efficiency Group with 3 sub-groups (Newly formed)**

This newly formed group focuses on organising and monitoring the implementation of measures in municipal, housing, and industrial sectors. The establishment of sub-groups ensures a detailed approach, allowing for effective delegation to responsible authorities. Close cooperation with other groups and commissions is encouraged to create synergies and ensure alignment with climate neutrality objectives.

**Environmental Communication Group (Newly formed)**

The Environmental Communication Group plays a pivotal role in fostering collaboration with all other groups to identify key needs. By organising and monitoring environmental communication activities, this group aims to enhance awareness and engagement. Effective delegation to responsible authorities and consistent feedback mechanisms to the CCC group are integral to its functioning.

**CCC Group (Informal and existing)**
Liepāja

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

The CCC group serves as a cornerstone in ensuring the conditions of NetZeroCities are met and communicated effectively. Through monitoring the implementation of joint measures, conducting annual inventories of CO2 emissions, and facilitating the renewal/updating of SECAP and CCC and other NetZeroCities initiative documents, the CCC group plays a central role in Liepāja's commitment to climate neutrality.

## Public Procurement Commission (Existing)

The Public Procurement Commission extends its role to include energy-related aspects and adaptation to climate change. Collaboration with all groups and commissions ensures a comprehensive approach, aligning procurement practices with climate goals.

## Strengthening existing groups and establishing new commissions

The existing commissions and groups listed in Table A-3.3.1 are pivotal to achieving climate neutrality. Their mandates will be extended, and potential compositions outlined.

These groups and commissions fall under the oversight of Liepāja Central administration, and their roles are already and will be further defined in comprehensive guidelines. This approach aims to establish clear communication channels, fostering effective commission functioning within the municipal framework.

## Stakeholder engagement

Recognising that achieving climate neutrality requires extensive involvement, Figure A-3.3.2 identifies key stakeholders, considering their interest and influence. A strategic focus will be placed on engaging all segments of society, as the local government recognises the indispensable role of collective efforts in attaining climate neutrality objectives. This inclusive approach aims to strengthen the organisational structure and enhance overall stakeholder participation in Liepāja's climate action initiatives.

It is evident that Liepāja has taken significant and strategic steps in integrating sustainability and climate action into its governance and management structures. The alignment of key personnel in various roles, coupled with the active participation of the city in initiatives such as the Covenant of Mayors, demonstrates a strong commitment to addressing climate and energy issues.

The fact that the deputy executive director, who serves as the municipality's energy management system manager, also holds a leadership position in the district heating company, allows for a coordinated and integrated approach. This alignment of roles can facilitate smoother communication and collaboration between the municipality and key energy stakeholders.

The involvement of Liepāja's city council members in the leadership and management roles of the Liepāja Special Economic Zone highlights a strategic approach to fostering green manufacturing companies. This ensures that economic development is aligned with sustainability goals and contributes to the city's overall climate objectives.

The mayor's role as a EU Climate Pact Ambassador and membership in the EU Committee of Regions, along with relevant qualifications in environmental science and management, reflects a high level of commitment and expertise. Such leadership at the mayoral level is crucial in driving city-wide initiatives and gaining recognition at national and international levels.

Liepāja's decision to join the Covenant of Mayors initiative in 2012 signifies a proactive approach to climate action. This commitment not only sets a standard for the city but also signals to residents, industries, and NGOs that Liepāja is dedicated to advancing sustainability and climate goals.

By being an example to other Latvian cities and already having completed foundational work towards climate neutrality, Liepāja positions itself as a leader in sustainable urban development. This can inspire and motivate other municipalities to follow suit.

## Actions that is in place and that are planned to address the lack of multi-level governance coordination

### Existing activities
Liepāja

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

In our unwavering commitment to advancing multi-level governance coordination, the CCC Working Group, under the leadership of the Liepāja Central administration, has extended its reach through active involvement at the national level. The Executive Director, along with his deputies, plays a crucial role in advocating for climate action improvements on the national stage. Their direct engagement in discussions with ministries and participation in the different national work groups underscores our dedication to influencing and enhancing national governance policies related to climate change.

Our Mayor, as a Climate Pact Ambassador and a distinguished member of the EU Committee of Regions, brings a wealth of experience and influence to our climate governance initiatives. His strategic involvement at both national and European levels amplifies our city's voice and positions. Liepāja as an active participant in shaping regional and continental climate policies. The Mayor's role not only strengthens our city's representation but also facilitates direct access to EU-wide discussions and best practices, fostering a collaborative environment for shared learning and impactful decision-making.

The Environmental Communication Group and CCC Working Group ensures that insights and advancements from these high-level discussions are effectively communicated to our local stakeholders. By maintaining transparent communication channels and disseminating information on national and EU-level engagements, we empower our community with knowledge, encouraging active participation and fostering a sense of shared responsibility in Liepāja's journey towards climate neutrality.

## Planned activities

Together with NGOs, for example "Vefresh", we are initiating forums that bring together representatives from various municipalities, ministries, and regional planning bodies. These forums provide a structured platform for open discussions, knowledge-sharing, and collaborative problem-solving. By actively participating in these advocacy forums, Liepāja aims to contribute to the development of coherent national climate policies that align with local and regional priorities.

Recognising the collaborative strength of the Kurzeme Planning Region's initiatives, Liepāja is actively engaging in efforts to join forces with other cities within the region. By participating in collaborative projects facilitated by the Kurzeme Planning Region, we are leveraging shared resources, knowledge, and expertise to enhance the impact of our climate initiatives. This collaborative approach not only strengthens multi-level governance coordination within the region but also promotes a unified front in addressing climate challenges.

In our commitment to multi-level governance coordination, Liepāja is initiating information exchange, where representatives from ministries gather to share plans and priorities, deepen understanding, build relationships, and streamline coordination. Liepāja, along with Riga, hope to continue actively contribute to these discussions, aligning city's climate strategies with national priorities. This adaptive approach ensures our cities remain at the forefront of multi-level governance coordination, shaping the national discourse on climate action..

## 5.2 Module C-2 Social and Other Innovation Interventions

In addition to the summary table presented in C-2.1, this section provides more detailed descriptions and comments on each social innovation intervention.

Energy Communities aim to create distinct local groups focused on energy production (mostly for their own use). After lead taken by the Energy Efficiency Group, collaboration involves the municipality, residents, businesses, and NGOs. Through collective efforts, these communities ensure a higher share of renewable energy sources by fostering citizen and entrepreneurial participation.

Figure: C-2.2.1: Procedure for sharing electricity (source: Ministry of Climate and Energy presentation 18.12.2023.)

The Public participation budget initiative is a support instrument administered by the municipality. It involves collaboration with residents and focuses on implementing citizens' initiatives that contribute to climate mitigation and nature-based solutions. This approach fosters public involvement in shaping and executing projects that enhance the urban environment. Some of the municipalities in Latvia already have Public participation budget and Local Government Law states obligation for every municipality in Latvia to implement this in year 2025.

A local government shall use the participatory budget to promote the participation of the inhabitants of the administrative territory of the local government in taking decisions on the development of the territory having regard to the requirements of this Law. The inhabitants of the administrative territory of the local government shall decide on the use of the participatory budget.

A council shall provide for the financing of the participatory budget in the annual budget of the local government at least in the amount of 0.5 per cent of the average actual revenue of one year of personal income tax and immovable property tax of the local government calculated for the last three years.

The participatory budget shall be divided into participatory budget planning units (territories) which shall be determined in the development programme of the local government. The participatory budget planning unit (territory) may be the entire administrative territory of the local government.

The financing of the participatory budget shall be used for territorial development projects proposed by society (hereinafter - the projects). The submission and selection of the projects shall be organised by the local government in each participatory budget planning unit.

Led by the Liepāja Special Economic Zone (LSEZ) and municipality, the Social Entrepreneurship program not only supports and promotes individuals developing innovative solutions for climate neutrality but also involves additional initiatives to foster economic growth and entrepreneurial development within the region.
Liepāja

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

In collaboration with the LSEZ, the system includes an evaluation process where LSEZ assesses and selects companies to operate within their territories. This ensures that businesses align with regional goals and contribute to sustainable development.

The municipality actively assists reemigrants in starting their businesses. This support include providing guidance, resources, and incentives to encourage individuals returning to the region to initiate and grow their enterprises.

The municipality organises project competitions specifically designed to support entrepreneurs. These competitions serve as a platform for innovative ideas, offering financial and logistical support to selected projects that align with the municipality's objectives.

Within educational model collaboration between the Central administration and the Education Authority results in the development of programs that impart knowledge of sustainable entrepreneurship and green jobs. Educational establishments (including Liepaja State Technical School), NGOs, and entrepreneurs participate, fostering a workforce with increased awareness of opportunities in a low-carbon economy.

The Waste Management Advisory Working Group and Environmental department are working to improve and accomplish a comprehensive food waste reduction program involving catering businesses, NGOs, waste managers ("Liepājas RAS"), and residents. This initiative contributes to reduced landfill, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the promotion of circular economy practices.

The municipality actively participates in various events organised across different locations, including those where NGOs are hosts. This engagement underscores the municipality's commitment to fostering collaboration, sharing knowledge, and staying connected with diverse stakeholders.

Facilitated by the office of Mayor, there is initiative of accessibility of environmentally friendly spaces for meetings of different local communities and groups. Regulatory mayor with other municipality's specialists meet in environmentally friendly and accessible spaces. The collective engagement of municipality and local communities promotes cooperation, public engagement, and increased awareness of sustainable practices within the community.

Led by the Transport Infrastructure Commission, this initiative involves public transport service providers, the Municipality, and other stakeholders in providing environmentally friendly transport infrastructure. The goal is to reduce CO2 emissions and the number of vehicles, thereby improving accessibility, mobility, and public health. This initiative encompasses various elements, including roads, walkways, electric charging stations, and strategies to encourage the use of public transport and sharing services.

If the direct goal is reduced CO2 emissions, then the indirect result is improved urban mobility safety, enhanced human health, and a more comfortable and convenient daily life.

Explain your city's motivation to join the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" and highlight your city's present commitments to climate action. You may also want to include the aims of this document.

## Your text

The City of Liepāja in Latvia has been at the forefront of efforts to reduce CO₂ emissions in its territory. Since 2006, we have successfully decreased emissions by 45%. By joining the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030," the city aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, becoming one of the first municipalities in Latvia to do so. Over the past 15 years, the city has collaborated with various stakeholders to implement energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, leading the way in testing innovative solutions to address climate change challenges. The main motivations for reaching climate neutrality include reducing the municipality's negative impact on climate change, aligning with EU and national climate policies, and serving as a model for other municipalities in Latvia, the Baltic region, and Europe.

To ensure success, the city emphasizes the integration of horizontal aspects and collaboration with stakeholders. We recognize the importance of engaging industries, service providers, residents, and others in the process of achieving climate neutrality. Principles such as "energy efficiency first" and "green procurement" will be integrated not only within the municipality but also in broader contexts, including the industry sector. The city will assess the social, economic, financial, and other impacts of policies and measures while adopting a cross-sectoral approach throughout the process.

Overall, joining the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" provides the city of Liepāja with financial support, collaboration opportunities with other municipalities across the EU, visibility, policy alignment, and access to innovative solutions. These benefits can accelerate the city's transition towards climate neutrality, promote sustainable development, and position Liepāja as a leader in the global fight against climate change.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Articulate your 2030 climate neutrality ambition, as expressed, and defined in your Cities Mission Expression of Interest (EoI). This should include your ambition and commitment to a 2030 horizon as a whole city, as well as describe any exclusion areas and summarise how these areas would be addressed beyond 2030. (A more detailed plan for exclusion areas should be included in the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.) Your 2030 ambition should be supported at a minimum by a Council decision, and it is recommended that it is also supported by a wider stakeholder group. We also recommend you to list other co-benefits you aim to achieve when working towards the climate neutrality goal, like well-being, health, equity, justice, financial savings.

## Your text

The City of Liepāja has set a clear goal to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, and is committed to taking bold climate actions to reach this target. The city recognizes the importance of delivering these actions in a fair and just manner, ensuring that no one is left behind in the transition to a climate-neutral future.

To achieve this goal, the City of Liepāja aims to reduce its overall CO₂ emissions by 80% compared to the base year of 2006. The city has developed a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2030, which has been approved by the City Council in August 2023. The plan has received strong support from key stakeholders, including the local district heating company, public utilities, industries, and

service providers, who are among the first to back the city's ambitious plans towards climate neutrality.

It is evident that Liepāja has taken significant and strategic steps in integrating sustainability and climate action into its governance and management structures. The alignment of key personnel in various roles, coupled with the active participation of the city in initiatives such as the Covenant of Mayors, demonstrates a strong commitment to addressing climate and energy issues.

The fact that the deputy executive director, who serves as the municipality's energy management system manager, also holds a leadership position in the district heating company, allows for a coordinated and integrated approach. This alignment of roles can facilitate smoother communication and collaboration between the municipality and key energy stakeholders.

The involvement of Liepāja's city council members in the leadership and management roles of the Liepāja Special Economic Zone highlights a strategic approach to fostering green manufacturing companies. This ensures that economic development is aligned with sustainability goals and contributes to the city's overall climate objectives.

The mayor's role as a EU Climate Pact Ambassador and membership in the EU Committee of Regions, along with relevant qualifications in environmental science and management, reflects a high level of commitment and expertise. Such leadership at the mayoral level is crucial in driving city-wide initiatives and gaining recognition at national and international levels.

Liepāja's decision to join the Covenant of Mayors initiative in 2012 signifies a proactive approach to climate action. This commitment not only sets a standard for the city but also signals to residents, industries, and NGOs that Liepāja is dedicated to advancing sustainability and climate goals.

By being an example to other Latvian cities and already having completed foundational work towards climate neutrality, Liepāja positions itself as a leader in sustainable urban development. This can inspire and motivate other municipalities to follow suit.

Liepāja's comprehensive and collaborative approach involving key stakeholders and leaders from various sectors is a model for effective climate governance. The city's initiatives and leadership roles contribute significantly to its reputation as a forward-thinking and sustainable community.

However, it is important to acknowledge that the successful attainment of these goals for the City of Liepāja depends on navigating and mitigating a multitude of external factors, some of which may be beyond the direct control of the city.

The benefits that arise from working towards climate neutrality are widely recognized by all involved parties. These benefits include improved well-being by creating healthier and more liveable environments for residents, health benefits resulting from reduced air pollution caused by fossil fuel emissions, addressing social equity and justice considerations, realizing financial savings, generating job creation and economic opportunities, enhancing resilience to climate-related risks, and protecting the environment.

By pursuing these co-benefits alongside the climate neutrality goal, the City of Liepāja demonstrates its commitment to creating a sustainable and prosperous future for its residents while taking decisive action to mitigate climate change.

# 3 Key priorities and strategic interventions

This is the core section of the Commitments document that should summarise at least 3 or 4 systemic strategic priorities that need to be implemented for your city to become climate neutral by 2030. These should be meaningful changes that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions in your city,
Liepāja

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

like decarbonising the heating system in the city or generating 100% energy from renewables. The individual commitments between your city and other stakeholders should address these key priorities and contribute to reaching them. The annexed 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan should describe the all interventions, including those to reach your priorities as well as all further actions, in detail and describe how your city plans to implement them.

## Your text

The City of Liepāja has carefully analysed its current CO₂ emissions and identified four key priorities that require urgent attention to achieve its climate neutrality goal by 2030. These priorities are as follows:

Decarbonising the heating system: The city aims to transition its heating system to carbon-neutral sources by 2030. This involves phasing out the use of fossil fuels and implementing renewable energy solutions for district heating.
100% renewable energy generation: Liepāja aims to generate and/or procure significant share of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. This includes promoting the development of renewable energy projects and increasing the use of clean energy in the city's electricity production.
Sustainable transport infrastructure: The city plans to invest in sustainable transport infrastructure to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. This includes expanding electric charging infrastructure, improving public transportation systems, and promoting active modes of transportation such as cycling and walking.
Energy-efficient housing sector: Liepāja aims to improve the energy efficiency of its housing sector. This involves implementing building renovation programs, promoting energy-efficient practices, and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources in residential buildings.

To ensure effective implementation of its climate neutrality action plan, the city has established a clear organisational scheme with defined roles and responsibilities. This allows the city to directly involve key stakeholders in the planning, organization, implementation, and evaluation of climate actions. The initial phase of the plan focuses on identifying the most suitable actions for the first 2-3 years, implementing them, and monitoring their results. Additionally, collaboration with the city of Riga and national stakeholders is essential to address any existing or potential barriers to climate neutrality and secure funding for the necessary actions.

## 4 Principles and process

Highlight the key principles that will guide your city as it implements its Climate City Contract, like accountability, transparency, or an open attitude to new approaches. The process should encompass principles like co-creation, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and should be systemic and demand-driven in nature. It should also be based on monitoring and joint learning. The Commitments Guidance document provides more specific guidance on how integrate these principles into your own process.

## Your text

The City of Liepāja is committed to implementing its Climate City Contract with a strong focus on key principles that guide its actions and ensure the success of its climate initiatives. These principles encompass accountability, transparency, an open attitude towards new approaches, and the active involvement of multiple actors, including citizens. The city believes in the power of co-creation, innovation, and engagement with various stakeholders to drive meaningful change.

The implementation process is designed to be systemic and demand-driven, meaning that it addresses the systemic challenges of climate change while responding to the specific needs and demands of the city and its residents. The city recognises that effective climate action requires continuous monitoring and joint learning. By regularly monitoring progress and outcomes, the city can
Liepāja

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

evaluate the effectiveness of its initiatives, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions for future actions.

The Commitments Guidance document serves as a valuable resource, providing specific guidance on how to integrate these principles into the city's climate action process. It offers practical advice and strategies for fostering accountability, transparency, co-creation, innovation, multi-actor and citizen engagement, and a demand-driven approach. By following the guidance provided, the city can ensure that its Climate City Contract aligns with these principles and maximizes its impact in addressing climate change.

Through the application of these key principles and the guidance provided, the City of Liepāja is dedicated to implementing its Climate City Contract in a way that is inclusive, effective, and sustainable, ultimately driving positive change and contributing to the global effort to combat climate change.

An important aspect we are examining is how inclusive and accessible the development process of the Action Plan is for all members of the community. We aim to identify any efforts made to remove obstacles for the involvement of marginalised groups.

Liepāja embraces the principle of "just transition" as a guiding force in its commitment to climate action. Recognising the importance of fairness and inclusivity, we strive to ensure that CCC activities are navigated in a socially equitable manner. While our commitment to "just transition" is firm, we acknowledge the need to elaborate on its practical implementation within the commitments document.

Liepāja Central administration is already involving marginalised communities in discussions for specifically tailored needs and it covers all topics not only climate change mitigation (see Action Plan).

Viena no Eiropas Savienības (ES) un Eiropas zaļā kursa¹ prioritātēm ir mazināt cilvēku radīto ietekmi uz klimata pārmaiņām, tāpēc ES un tās dalībvalstīs tiek intensīvi atbalstīti pasākumi energoefektivitātes paaugstināšanai, atjaunojamo energoresursu (AER) izmantošanai, kā arī vides apziņas celšanai. Šādi pasākumi šobrīd vairs netiek veikti ne tikai, lai nodrošinātu ES kopīgo mērķu sasniegšanu, ilgtspejīgu attīstību un ekonomisko izaugsmi, bet galvenokārt, lai pašvaldības spētu pārdomāti attīstīties un saviem iedzīvotājiem nodrošināt kvalitatīvu dzīves vidi.

ES kopīgie mērķi līdz 2030. gadam ir šādi:
par 40 % samazināt CO₂ emisijas attiecībā pret 1990. gadu;
par 32,5 % paaugstināt energoefektivitāti;
par 32 % palielināt AER īpatsvaru kopējā enerģijas galapatēriņš, bet līdz 2050. gadam Eiropa vēlas kļūt par pirmo klimatneitrālo kontinentu.

Pilsētu mēru pakts ir plašākā kustība, kurā iesaistījušās vairāk nekā 10 000 vietējās un reģionālās pašvaldības Eiropā, kas savās teritorijās brīvprātīgi apņemas samazināt CO₂ emisijas, palielināt pilsētu noturību pret klimata pārmaiņām un mazināt enerģētisko nabadzību. Pakta parakstītāji no 2020. gada apņemas nodrošināt klimata neitralitāti līdz 2050. gadam. Liepāja šajā iniciatīvā iesaistījās 2012. gadā.

Pilsētu mēru pakts ir plašākā kustība, kurā iesaistījušās vairāk nekā 10 000 vietējās un reģionālās pašvaldības Eiropā, kas savās teritorijās brīvprātīgi apņemas samazināt CO₂ emisijas, palielināt pilsētu noturību pret klimata pārmaiņām un mazināt enerģētisko nabadzību. Pakta parakstītāji no 2020. gada apņemas nodrošināt klimata neitralitāti līdz 2050. gadam. Liepāja šajā iniciatīvā iesaistījās 2012. gadā.

Šie mērķi ir sasniedzami, kopīgi sadarbojoties. Pašvaldībām ir izšķirīga loma ilgtspejīgas attīstības nodrošināšanā, jo 80% no enerģijas patēriņa un CO₂ emisijām ir cieši saistīti ar pilsētu darbību. Tāpēc pēc ES Klimata un enerģētikas tiesību akta kopuma pieņemšanas 2008. gadā Eiropas Komisija izveidoja Pilsētu mēru pakta iniciatīvu, lai apstiprinātu un atbalstītu vietējo pašvaldību centienus ilgtspejīgas enerģētikas politikas īstenošanā. Pilsētu mēru pakts šobrīd ir vienīgā kustība, kas apvieno vietējus un reģionālus dalībniekus ES mērķu sasniegšanai.

Liepājas pašvaldība Pilsētas mēru pakta iniciatīvai pievienojās 2012. gada 15. novembrī. Tā bija pirmā pašvaldības politiskā apņemšanās ieviest un sekot klimata un enerģētikas politikai vietējā līmeni. Tas bija galvenais virzītājspēks pašvaldībai, lai izstrādātu un īstenotu sākotnēji ilgtspejīgas enerģijas rīcības plānu līdz 2020. gadam (IERP2020) un tagad arī ilgtspejīgas enerģētikas un klimata rīcības plānu līdz 2030. gadam (IEKRP2030). Sākotnēji pievienojoties iniciatīvai, Liepājas pilsēta apņēmās līdz 2020. gadam sasniegt vismaz 20% CO₂ emisiju samazinājumu. 2022. gadā CO₂ emisiju apjoms pilsētā bija samazināts jau par 45% attiecībā pret 2006. gadu, kas ir izvēlēts par bāzes gadu. Kopš pievienošanās Pilsētas mēru paktam, izpratne par klimata un enerģētikas mērķiem ir ievērojami palielinājusies visos līmenos, un 2023. gadā Liepājas pilsēta apņemas sasniegt vērienīgākus mērķus - klimatneitralitāti līdz 2030. gadam.

Liepāja bija starp pirmajām pašvaldībām Latvijā, kas 2016. gadā ieviesa sertificētu energopārvaldības sistēmu sistemātiskai enerģijas patēriņa samazināšanai pašvaldības infrastruktūrā. Enerġopārvaldības sistēmas uzturēšana nodrošina līdz pat 5% enerģijas ietaupījumu pirmajos gados un ir viens no pasākumiem ar zemākajām izmaksām, ar kura palīdzību pašvaldība var rādīt piemēru un paraugpraksi citiem.

Kopš 2014. gada "Liepājas enerģija" ir īstenojusi virkni kurināmā maiņas projektu (no dabasgāzes uz biomasu), kā rezultātā 2022. gadā jau aptuveni 80% no siltumenerģijas

tiek saražota no šķeldas. Tas ļāvis samazināt pilsētas CO₂ emisijas no vietējās enerģijas ražošanas sektora par 85%, salīdzinot ar 2006. gadu.

Liepāja ir starp tām Latvijas pašvaldībām, kas ir atjaunojusi jau ievērojamu daļu no daudzdzīvokļu ēkām. Gandrīz 200 no 600 daudzdzīvokļu ēkām, kas pieslēgtas Liepājas centralizētajai siltumapgādes sistēmai (CSS), līdz 2023. gadam ir atjaunotas un siltumenerģijas patēriņš tajās ir samazināts vairāk kā par 50%.

Arī sabiedriskajam transportam Liepājā ir izšķiroša nozīme, un pēdējos gados Liepājas pašvaldība ir ieguldījusi līdzekļus tramvaju līnijas pagarināšanā 1,7 km garumā. Tas pilsētas iedzīvotājiem un viesiem ļauj nodrošināt videi draudzīgu pārvietošanās veidu. Pasākums ir ļāvis samazināt nepieciešamo autobusu apjomu sabiedriskā transporta maršruta tīklā Liepājas pilsētā, kurā izmanto fosilo kurināmo.

Liepāja

gadā 19. martā tika apstiprināts Liepājas pilsētas Ilgtspējīgas enerģētikas un klimata rīcības plāns 2020.-2030. gadam. Tajā tika noteikts mērķis stabilizēt pilsētas CO₂ emisijas 45% līmenī līdz 2030. gadam, salīdzinot ar 2006. gadu. Atjaunotajā IEKRP tika iekļauta arī ilgtermiņa vīzija samazināt CO₂ emisijas par 80% līdz 2050. gadam, kā arī plāns papildināts ar klimata pielāgošanās pasākumiem.

gadā Liepājas pilsēta lēma pieteikties un tika arī izvēlēta kā viena no ES misijas "100 klimatneitrālas un viedas pilsētas līdz 2030. gadam" ("Net Zero Cities"), tādejādi

Net Zero Cities iniciatīva atbalsta Eiropu un jo īpaši Eiropas pilsētas, lai ar klimata pasākumiem krasi samazinātu siltumnīcefekta gāzu emisijas, lai panāktu "klimata neitralitāti", kas ir viens no lielākajiem izaicinājumiem, ar ko šodien saskaras mūsu sabiedrība.

izvirzot daudz ambiciozākus mērķus - samazināt CO₂ emisiju apjomu 80% apmērā līdz 2030. gadam. Saskaņā ar pievienošanos ES misijas "100 klimatneitrālas un viedas pilsētas līdz 2030. gadam" iniciatīvai, 2023. gadā Liepājas pašvaldība aktualizē savu IEKRP ar konkrētām un mērķiecīgām rīcībām. Liepājas pilsētas piecas galvenās prioritātes ir apkopotas 2.attēlā.

attēls: Liepājas pilsētas galvenās prioritātes, virzoties pretī klimatneitralitātei

Liepājas pilsētas ilgtspējīgas enerģētikas un klimata rīcības plāna (IEKRP2030) 1. nodaļā ir dots īss ieskats esošajos normatīvajos aktos un plānošanas dokumentos, kas nosaka Eiropas Savienības, Latvijas, Kurzemes plānošanas reģiona un arī Liepājas pilsētas politiku enerģētikas un klimata jomās. 2. nodaļā ir definēta Liepājas pilsētas vīzija un mērķi, kā arī apskatīti organizatoriskie un finanšu aspekti. 3. nodaļā ir aprakstīta esošā situācija par pašvaldības, mājokļu, enerģijas ražošanas un transporta sektoriem. 4. nodaļā ir apkopoti pasākumi, ar kuru palīdzību pašvaldība varēs sasniegt klimatneitralitātes mērķus līdz 2030. gadam, bet 5. nodaļā ir dots klimata pārmaiņu risku un neaizsargātības izvērtējums un pasākumi šajā sektorā. 6. nodaļā ir noteikta kārtība ieviesto pasākumu un rīcību turpmākai uzraudzībai. Plāna pielikumos ir dota papildu informācija, piemēram, 1.pielikumā dots visu pasākumu apkopojums, bet 3.pielikumā - CO₂ emisiju aprēķinu metodika.

Plāna izstrādes laikā tika rīkoti pasākumi sabiedrības iesaistei, kā piemēram, hakatoni, diskusijas ar NVO un ministrījām, Energoefektivitātes nedēļas organizēšana u.c., kuros dalībnieki aktīvi diskutēja un pauda savu viedokli saistībā ar Liepājas mērķi kļūt par vienu no pirmajām 100 klimatneitrālajām pilsētām Eiropā un kā to sasniegt. Pasākumos diskutēts par potenciālajiem pasākumiem transporta, energoefektivitātes, pielāgošanās

Liepāja

klimata pārmaiņām un citās jomās. Pasākumu laikā sniegtās idejas un ieteikumi ir iekļauti plānā.

Tāpat arī turpmāk ir plānots aktīvi iesaistīt sabiedrību IEKRP2030 uzlabošana un papildināšanā, kā arī pasākumu īstenošanā. Kā daži no šādiem pasākumiem minami: Izglītības pārvaldes rīkotie hakatoni par viedas pilsētvides attīstību, digitalizāciju u.c. tematiem, iedzīvotāju aptaujas par klimata pārmaiņām un mobilitāti, semināri par energoefektivitāti utt. Jāpiemin, ka ar sabiedrības informēšanu un iesaistīšanu nodarbojas ne tikai pašvaldība un tās kapitālsabiedrības, bet arī NVO (tostarp caur pašvaldības izsludinātajiem finansējuma konkursiem), Liepājas universitāte, LSEZ un citi uzņēmumi.

Nemot vērā, ka šajā plānā ir izvirzīta virkne vidēja termiņa mērķu, plānu ir nepieciešams pārskatīt vismaz reizi divos gados un izvērtēt gan pasākumu ieviešanas gaitu un sasniegumus, gan pārskatīt nepieciešamos pasākumus mērķu sasniegšanai un plānot papildu pasākumus.

Liepājas valstspilsētas turpmākie plāni:

Apstiprināt atjaunoto IEKRP2030 un parakstīt Klimatpilsētas līgumu.
Izveidot organizatorisko struktūru plāna ieviešanai un uzraudzībai atbilstoši organizatoriskajai shēmai 2.3.nodalā.
Sagatavot konkrētu rīcības ieviešanas grafiku 2023.-2025. gadam, nosakot arī atbildīgās personas un nepieciešamos resursus.
Nodrošināt rīcībspējīgu organizatorisko struktūru plāna ieviešanai un uzraudzībai.
Ieviest un iesaistīt visas sabiedrības grupas priorītāro pasākumu ieviešanā, nodrošinot arī pasākumu monitoringu.
Izvērtēt un papildināt plānu ar aprēķinu enerģijas patēriņam un radītajām emisijām no Liepājas pilsētas atkritumu apsaimniekošanas.
2025. gadā atjaunot IEKRP2030, balstoties uz emisiju apjomiem un ieviesto pasākumu monitoringa rezultātiem, un, ja nepieciešams, papildināt vai iekļaut papildu rīcības.

# 1. Normatīvo aktu un politikas plānošanas dokumentu pārskats

pielikumā ir apkopoti visi plānošanas dokumenti Eiropas, Latvijas, Kurzemes plānošanas reģiona, kā arī Liepājas pilsētas līmenī, kas attiecas uz Liepājas pilsētas ilgtspejīgas enerģētikas un klimata rīcības plāna 2030. gadam izstrādi un pilsētas klimatneitralitātes līdz 2030. gadam sasniegšanu. Turpmāk šajā sadaļa ir plašāk aprakstīts katrs no dokumentiem.

## 1.1 Eiropas savienības un globālā politika

gadā Apvienoto Nāciju Organizācijas (ANO) Ģenerālajā asamblejā pieņēma "Ilgtspējīgas attīstības programmu 2030. gadam", kurā nodefinēti 17 Ilgtspējīgas attīstības mērķi un 169 apakšmērķi, kas sasniedzami, lai pasaulē mazinātos nabadzība un pasaules attīstība būtu ilgtspejīgāka (skatīt 1.1. attēlu). Šo mērķu iekļaušana ir nozīmīga arī turpmākajā Liepājas pilsētas attīstībā enerģētikas un pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām jomās.

## 1.1.1 Enerģētika un ietekmes uz klimatu mazināšana

Lai sasniegtu šos mērķus, 2019. gada 11. decembrī tika pieņemta Eiropas Savienības (ES) stratēģija "Eiropas Savienības Zālais kurss"³ (European Green Deal), kas nosaka ES klimata

un enerģētikas politikas galvenos virzienus. Tajā ir izklāstīta ES izaugsmes stratēģija, kuras mērķis ir veidot ES par taisnīgu un pārticīgu sabiedrību, uzlabot pašreizējo un nākamo paaudžu dzīves kvalitāti un veidot mūsdienīgu, resursu efektīvu un konkurētspējīgu ekonomiku, kurā siltumnīcefekta gāzu neto emisijas 2050. gadā samazinātos līdz nullei un ekonomiskā izaugsme būtu atsaistīta no resursu patēriņa (skatīt 1.3.attēlu).

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

## 1.3.attēls: Eiropas Zālais kurss

ES mērogā enerģētikas politika periodam līdz 2050. gadam ir noteikta EK paziņojumā "Celvedis virzībai uz konkurētspējīgu ekonomiku ar zemu oglekļa dioksīda emisiju līmeni 2050. gadu"⁵. Savukārt periodam līdz 2030. gadam enerģētikas politika ir noteikta EK paziņojumā "Tīru enerģiju ikvienam Eiropā"⁶. ES ir identificējusi trīs galvenos aspektus enerģētikas mērķu sasniegšanai: energoefektivitātes uzlabošana, atjaunojamo energoreursu (AER) plašāka lietošana un siltumnīcefekta gāzu (SEG) emisiju samazināšana.

Zalā kursa īstenošanai ar Eiropas Klimata aktu ir izvirzīts virsmērķis līdz 2050. gadam: sasniegt klimatneitralitāti ES līmeni, kā arī ir palielināts SEG emisiju samazināšanas mērķis 2030. gadam. Papildus tam 2021. gada 14. jūlijā Eiropas Komisija nāca klajā ar tiesību aktu pakotni "Gatavi mērķrādītājam 55%", lai salāgotu esošo Eiropas klimata politiku ar jaunajiem virsmērķiem, jo katra tiesību akta priekšlikumam un plānotajai rīcībai nepieciešams noteikt atbilstību "zalajam zvērestam - nekaitēt" (A green oath: 'do no harm'), t.i., apņemšanās, lai neviens plānotais pasākums vismaz nekaitētu (bet vēlamis - veicinātu) Zalā kursa mērķu īstenošanu.

ES energoefektivitātes mērķi ir atrunāti Eiropas Parlamenta un Padomes direktīvā 2018/844/ES⁷, kurā noteikti arī dalībvalstu līmeni veicamie pasākumi. Direktīva tika izstrādāta 2012. gadā (sākotnējais tās numurs - 2012/27/ES), bet pārskatīta 2023. gadā. Saskaņā ar jauno direktīvu dalībvalstīm kolektīvi būs jānodrošina enerģijas galapatēriņa samazinājums 2030. gadā vismaz par 11,7% salīdzinājumā ar 2020. gadu.

Liepājas valstspilsētas ilgtspējīgas enerģētikas un klimata rīcības plāns 2023.–2030. gadam
Liepāja

Pārstrādātā direktīva vēl vairāk nosti prina publiskā sektora parauglomu energoefektivitātes prakses uzlabošanā. Direktīvā ikgādējā enerģijas patēriņa samazinājuma mērķis 1,9% apmērā attiecas uz visu publisko sektoru kopumā. Turklāt ikgādējais 3% ēku renovācijas pienākums tiek attiecināts uz visiem valsts pārvaldes līmeniem. Papildus publiskais sektors spēlēs vadošu lomu energoefektivitātes pakalpojumu tirgus attīstībā. Energoefektivitātes līgumiem, kad vien iespējams, tiks piešķirta prioritāte energoefektivitātes projektu īstenošanā publiskajā sektorā. Pienemot lēmumus par iepirkumiem, valsts iestādes turpinās apsvērt energoefektivitātes prasības, veicinot sistemātiskus uzlabojumus.

Papildus valstis ir spiestas par prioritāti noteikt energoefektivitātes uzlabojumus neaizsargātiem patērētājiem, mājsaimniecībām ar zemiem ienākumiem un personām sociālajos mājokļos.

## 1.1.2 Pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām

gada 24. februārī Eiropas Komisija pieņēma jauno Eiropas Savienības stratēģiju adaptācijai pret klimata pārmaiņām⁸. Stratēģijā ir izklāstīts, kā ES var pielāgoties klimata pārmaiņu nenovēršamajām sekām un līdz 2050. gadam kļūt noturīga pret tām.

Pašvaldību līmenī enerģētikas sektora attīstību un ietekmi uz klimatu mazināšanu veicina Pilsētu mēru pakta⁹ (Covenant of Mayors) iniciatīva, kas aizsākās 2008. gadā pēc ES klimata un enerģētikas tiesību aktu paketes pieņemšanas. 2014. gadā tika uzsākta Mayors Adapt¹⁰ iniciatīva, kuras mērķis bija veicināt un atbalstīt pašvaldību pielāgošanos klimata pārmaiņām. 2015. gadā šīs abas iniciatīvas tika apvienotas vienā iniciatīvā ar nosaukumu – "Pilsētu mēru pakts enerģētikas un klimata jomā" (Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy). Līdz ar to pašvaldībām, kas pievienojusās šai iniciatīvai (to ir vairāk nekā 10,5 tūkstoši), ir jāizstrādā llgtspējīgas enerģētikas un klimata rīcības plāns. Iniciatīvas ietvaros ir izstrādāta plaši izmantota metodika, kā pašvaldībām plānus izstrādāt un ieviest, kā noteikt mērķus un pasākumus, kas vērsti gan uz enerģijas patēriņa samazināšanu, gan ietekmes uz klimatu mazināšanu, gan pielāgošanos klimata pārmaiņām, kā arī enerģētiskās nabadzības mazināšanu. Liepājas pilsēta 2012. gadā parakstīja Pilsētu mēru pakta iniciatīvu.

## 1.2 Nacionālā politika

### 1.2.1 Enerģētika un ietekmes uz klimatu mazināšana

Valsts augstākajā ilgtermiņa attīstības plānošanas dokumentā „Latvijas ilgtspējīgas attīstības stratēģija līdz 2030. gadam“¹¹ kā galvenais mērķis enerģētikas sektorā ir noteikta valsts enerģētiskās neatkarības nodrošināšana, palielinot energoresursu pašnodrošinājumu un integrējoties ES enerģijas tīklos.

AER un energoefektivitātes jomā ir noteikti šādi prioritārie ilgtermiņa rīcības virzieni (iespējamie risinājumi):

enerģētiskā drošība un neatkarība;
AER (biomasas, salmu, niedru, kūdras, vēja, saules, biogāzes) izmantošana un inovācija;
energoefektivitātes pasākumi (daudzdzīvokļu ēku atjaunošana, siltumenerģijas ražošanas efektivitātes paaugstināšana, investīcijas centralizētajā siltumapgādē (CSS), energoefektīvs ielu apgaismojums pilsētās, racionāla enerģijas patēriņa veicināšana

Liepājas valstspilsētas ilgtspējīgas enerģētikas un klimata rīcības plāns 2023.-2030. gadam
Liepāja

mājsaimniecības, valsts un pašvaldību iepirkumu konkursu kritērijos būtu jāiekļauj energoefektivitāte un produktu dzīves cikla analīzes apsvērumi);

energoefektīva un videi draudzīga transporta politika (videi draudzīgs transports, gājēju ielas, veloceliņi un zaļie koridori, elektriskā transporta energoefektivitātes uzlabošana un sasaistē ar citiem transporta veidiem).

Valsts augstākais vidēja termiņa attīstības plānošanas dokuments „Latvijas Nacionālais attīstības plāns 2021.-2027. gadam“¹² nosaka galvenās prioritātes, kuru starpā viens no rīcības virzieniem ir „Daba un vide – Zaļais kurss“. Tā galvenie mērķi ir virzība uz oglekļa mazietilpīgu, resursu efektīvu un klimatnoturīgu attīstību, kā arī biologiskās daudzveidības saglabāšanu.

Ministru kabinets ar 2020. gada 4. februāra rīkojumu Nr.46 apstiprināja plānošanas dokumentu „Latvijas Nacionālais enerģētikas un klimata plāns 2021.-2030. gadam“¹³ (NEKP2030).

Atbilstoši NEKP2030: Plāna ilgtermiņa vīzija ir ilgtspējīgā, konkurētspējīgā un drošā veidā veicināt ilgtspējīgas tautsaimniecības attīstību.

Plāna ilgtermiņa mērķis ir, uzlabojot enerģētisko drošību un sabiedrības labklājību, ilgtspējīgā, konkurētspējīgā, izmaksu efektīvā, drošā un uz tirgus principiem balstītā veidā veicināt klimatneitrālas tautsaimniecības attīstību.

Lai īstenotu mērķi, ir nepieciešams:

Veicināt resursu efektīvu izmantošanu, kā arī to pašpietiekamību un dažādību;
Nodrošināt resursu, un it īpaši fosilu un neilgtspējīgu resursu, patēriņa būtisku samazināšanu un vienlaicīgu pāreju uz ilgtspējīgu, atjaunojamu un inovatīvu resursu izmantošanu, nodrošinot vienlīdzīgu pieeju energoresursiem visām sabiedrības grupām;
Stimulēt tādas pētniecības un inovāciju attīstību, kas veicina ilgtspējīgas enerģētikas sektora attīstību un klimata pārmaiņu mazināšanu.

Saskaņā ar NEKP2030: Latvijas valsts obligātais mērķis 2030. gadam ir 20 472,02 GWh kumulatīvs enerģijas galapatēriņa ietaupījums. Plāna rīcībpolitiku īstenošanai piedāvāto pasākumu īstenošanas kopējais paredzamais (vēlamais) finansējuma apjoms ir 7 362,1 milj.EUR, tai skaitā: ēku energoefektivitātes uzlabošanai – 1 730,04 milj.EUR; energoefektivitātes uzlabošanai un AER tehnoloģiju izmantošanas veicināšana siltumapgādē, aukstumapgādē un rūpniecībā – 1 663,43 milj. EUR.

gadā tika pārskatīta un pieņemta jaunā Eiropas Parlamenta un Padomes direktīvā 2023/1791 par energoefektivitāti, kas nosaka ambiciozākus mērķus attiecībā uz enerģijas patēriņa samazinājumu. Dalībvalstīm, tai skaitā Latvijai, ir pienākums atjaunot savus NEKP, tajos nosakot indikatīvus nacionālos devumus un trajektorijas virzībā uz mērķrādītāja sasniegšanu. Atjauninātā plāna gala redakciju ir jāiesniedz līdz 2024. gada jūnijam.

Saskaņā ar Eiropas Parlamenta un Padomes Direktīvu 2012/27/ES par energoefektivitāti, 2017. gadā tika izstrādāts informatīvais ziņojums „Ēku atjaunošanas ilgtermiņa stratēģija“¹⁴, 2020. gadā tā tika pārskatīta. Stratēģijas mērķis ir mobilizēt ieguldījumus gan valsts, gan privāto dzīvojamo ēku un komercplatību fonda atjaunošanā. Stratēģijā noteikts, ka daudzdzīvokļu ēku atjaunošana un energoefektivitātes paaugstināšana ir viens no Latvijas valsts mājokļu un enerģētikas politikas mērķiem. Stratēģija nosaka rentablas renovācijas pieejas atkarībā no ēku veida un klimatiskās joslas, kā arī nepieciešamos

Liepāja

politiskos pasākumus, lai veicinātu ēku rentablu, pilnīgu renovāciju, tostarp pakāpenisku, pilnīgu renovāciju.

gada 28. maijā Ministru kabinets izskatāja un akceptēļa Ekonomikas ministrijas informatīvo ziņojumu „Latvijas Energētikas ilgtermiņa stratēģija 2030 – konkurētspējīga enerģētika sabiedrībai“¹⁵ (LEIS2030). Stratēģija ir izstrādāta, lai piedāvātu jaunu enerģētikas politikas scenāriju, kas vērsts ne vien uz enerģētikas sektora attīstību, bet skata to kontekstā ar klimata politiku – ES saistošo ietvaru SEG emisiju samazināšanai. Tās galvenais mērķis ir konkurētspējīga ekonomika, veidojot sabalansētu, efektīvu, uz tirgus principiem balstītu enerģētikas politiku, kas nodrošina Latvijas ekonomikas tālāko attīstību, tās konkurētspēju reģionā un pasaulē, kā arī sabiedrības labklājību.

Viens no „LEIS2030“ apakšmērķiem ir ilgstspējīga enerģētika. To plānots panākt, uzlabojot energoefektivitāti un veicinot efektīvas atjaunojamo energoresursu izmantošanas tehnoloģijas. Energoefektivitātei ir jāklūst par horizontālu starpnozaru politikas mērķi, iekļaujot to citās politikas jomās, tādās kā reģionālā un pilsētu attīstība, transports, rūpniecības politika, lauksaimniecība.

LEIS2030 ir noteikti šādi mērķi un rezultātīvie rādītāji 2030. gadā:

nodrošināt 50% AER īpatsvaru bruto enerģijas galapatēriņš (nesaistošs mērķis);
par 50% samazināt enerģijas un energoresursu importu no esošajiem trešo valstu piegādātājiem;
vidējais siltumenerģijas patēriņš apkurei tiek samazināts par 50% pret pašreizējo rādītāju, kas ar klimata korekciju ir aptuveni 200 kWh/m² gadā.

gada 28. janvārī Ministru Kabinets izskatāja Vides aizsardzības un reģionālās attīstības ministrijas izstrādāto informatīvo ziņojumu „Latvijas stratēģija klimatneitralitātes sasniegšanai līdz 2050. gadam“¹⁶, kas ir ilgtermiņa politikas plānošanas dokuments, kas jāievies, horizontāli integrējot SEG un klimatnoturīguma mērķus visās tautsaimniecības nozarēs. Stratēģijas virsmērķis ir panākt Latvijas klimatneitralitāti 2050. gadā. Dokumentā ir izvirzīti divi stratēģiskie mērķi: (1) SEG emisiju samazināšana visos tautsaimniecības sektoros; (2) CO₂ piesaistes palielināšana. Klimatneitralitātes sasniegšanai plānots izmantot divas pamatpieejas: (1) tehnoloģiskie risinājumi; (2) dzīvesveida maiņa. Stratēģija atzīst, ka pašvaldībām, veicot esošos normatīvajos aktos noteiktos pienākumus, ir izšķiroša loma valsts virzībā uz klimatneitralitāti.

Latvijas indikatīvais mērķis saskaņā ar Eiropas Parlamenta un Padomes direktīvā 2012/27/ES par energoefektivitāti un arī pārējās direktīvas prasības ir izstrādātas Energoefektivitātes likumā, kas stājas spēkā 2016. gada 29. martā. Energoefektivitātes likums tiks pārskatīts, ņemot vērā Eiropas Parlamenta un Padomes direktīvu 2023/1791 par energoefektivitāti un atjaunināto NEKP2030.

Likuma 5. pantā par energoefektivitāti valsts un pašvaldības sektorā ir noteiktas šādas tiesības un pienākumi, kas attiecas uz Liepājas valstspilsētas pašvaldību:

(1) Valsts iestādēm, pašvaldībām un citām atvasinātām publiskām personām ir tiesības:

izstrādāt un pieņemt energoefektivitātes plānu kā atsevišķu dokumentu vai kā pašvaldības teritorijas attīstības programmas sastāvdaļu, kurā iekļauti noteikti energoefektivitātes mērķi un tās uzlabošanas pasākumi;
atsevišķi vai kā sava energoefektivitātes plāna īstenošanas sastāvdaļu ieviest energopārvaldības sistēmu;
izmantot energoefektivitātes pakalpojumus un slēgt energoefektivitātes pakalpojuma līgumus, lai īstenotu energoefektivitātes uzlabošanas pasākumus.

(2) Valstspilsētu pašvaldības ievies un uztur sertificētu energopārvaldības sistēmu.

(5) Valsts iestāde, pašvaldība vai cita atvasināta publiska persona, kas ieviesusi energopārvaldības sistēmu, katru gadu informē atbildīgo iestādi par energopārvaldības sistēmas darbības rezultātā iegūto enerģijas ietaupījumu. Kārtību, kādā valsts iestāde, pašvaldība un cita atvasināta publiska persona ziņo par iegūto enerģijas ietaupījumu pēc energopārvaldības sistēmas ieviešanas, nosaka Ministru kabinets.

(6) Vērtējot projektus, kuri tiks pilnībā vai daļēji īstenoti, izmantojot maksājumus no valsts budžeta, valsts galvojumus, kredītu procentu likmju subsīdijas vai citu finanšu palīdzību, kas tiek piešķirta vai sniegta no valsts vai Eiropas Savienības budžeta līdzekļiem un ārvalstu finanšu palīdzības līdzekļiem, valsts iestādēm, pašvaldībām un citām atvasinātām publiskām personām, kuras ir ieviesušas energopārvaldības sistēmu, palielina atbilstoši kvalitātes vērtēšanas kritērijiem maksimāli iegūstamo punktu skaitu, ievērojot kārtību, kādu nosaka normatīvais akts par attiecīgā finansējuma piešķiršanu.

Ēku energoefektivitātes likuma¹⁷ normas izriet no Eiropas Parlamenta un Padomes Direktīvas 2010/31/ES par ēku energoefektivitāti. Šī likuma mērķis ir veicināt energoresursu racionālu izmantošanu, uzlabojot ēku energoefektivitāti, kā arī informējot sabiedrību par ēkas enerģijas patēriņu. Likums nosaka gan ekspluatējamu, gan projektējamu, pārbūvējamu vai atjaunojamu ēku minimālās energoefektivitātes prasības, kā arī ēku energosertifikācijas, apkures sistēmu un gaisa kondicionēšanas sistēmu pārbaudes prasības.

Vēl viens nozīmīgs aspekts, kas jāizvērtē enerģētikas un klimata jomās, ir enerģētiskā nabadzība. Enerģētikas likumā enerģētiskā nabadzība ir definēta kā "mājsaimniecības lietotāja nespēja uzturēt mājoklī atbilstošu temperatūru vai izmantot energoapgādes komersantu sniegtos pakalpojumus, vai norēķināties par tiem zemas energoefektivitātes dēļ vai tādēļ, ka maksai par šiem pakalpojumiem ir augsts īpatsvars mājsaimniecības ienākumos". Enerģētiskā nabadzība skar aptuveni 36 miljonus ES iedzīvotāju, un ir sagaidāms, ka situācija ir pasliktinājusies globālo veselības un enerģētikas krīžu rezultātā¹⁸. Latvijā 2018. gadā siltuma nodrošināšana mājoklī naudas trūkuma dēļ bija liegta 7,5% (ES - 8%) no visiem Latvijas iedzīvotājiem vai 9,8% no visām Latvijas mājsaimniecībām¹⁹.

Latvijas Nacionālajā enerģētikas un klimata plānā ir noteikts mērķis līdz 2030. gadam enerģētisko nabadzību Latvijā samazināt zem vidējās vērtības ES, proti, līdz 2030. gadam sasniegt rādītāju zem 7,5%. ES līmenī pasākumi, lai novērstu enerģētisko nabadzību, ir noteikti ar tiesību aktu kopumu "Tīru enerģiju ikvienam Eiropā". Enerģētiskās nabadzības mazināšana ir iekļauta gan Latvijas Nacionālajā attīstības plānā 2027. gadam, gan Ēku atjaunošanas ilgtermiņa stratēģijā.

Aktuāla problēma Latvijā ir arī gaisa kvalitātes uzlabošana un piesārņojuma samazināšana. Šajā jomā 2020. gada 16. aprīlī tika apstiprināts Gaisa piesārņojuma samazināšanas ricības plāns 2020.-2030. gadam²⁰. Plāns izstrādāts, lai samazinātu gaisa piesārņojuma radīto negatīvo ietekmi uz vidi un cilvēku veselību, kā arī samazinātu izmaksas un zaudēto darba laiku, ko veselības problēmu un ārstu apmeklējumu dēļ rada gaisa piesārņojums.

Attiecībā uz transporta nozari plāna izstrādes laikā starpministriju saskaņošanas stadijā ir Transporta enerģijas likums. Likumprojekta "Transporta enerģijas likums"²¹ mērķis ir veicināt cilvēku veselībai un apkārtējai videi drošu transporta enerģijas aprīti un nodrošināt alternatīvo degvielu infrastruktūras attīstību un sabiedrības informētību

par pieejamiem un izmantojamajiem transporta energijas veidiem. Plānotais tiesiskais regulējums ietekmēs arī pašvaldības. Saskaņā ar likumprojektu Liepājai:

būs jānosaka transportlīdzekļu izmantošanas nosacījumus pašvaldības teritorijā, lai veicinātu transportlīdzekļu izmantošanas radīto emisiju samazināšanu;
būs jānodrošina, ka pilsētas sabiedriskajā transportā izmantotās transporta enerģijas apjomā 2030. gadā vismaz 50% ir atjaunojamā enerģija;
būs jānodrošina, ka pašvaldības publisko iepirkumu ietvaros iegādāto transportlīdzekļu apjomā, sākot ar 2030. gada 1. janvāri, vismaz 50% ir jābūt tādiem transportlīdzekļiem, kuros tiek izmantota atjaunojamā enerģija.

Transporta attīstības pamatnostādnes 2021.-2027. gadam²² ir vidēja termiņa politikas plānošanas dokuments transporta nozares attīstībai, un tajā izvirzītais mērķis ir vērsts uz ilgtspējīgu cilvēka mobilitātes vajadzību apmierināšanu, vienlaikus sniedzot ieguldījumu valsts ekonomiskajā izaugsmē, t.sk. uzņēmējdarbības vides attīstībā un pieejamībā. Pamatnostādnes rīcības ietver virkni pasākumus, kas svarīgi ari Liepājas valstpilsētas attīstībai.

## 1.2.2 Pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām

Valsts augstākajā ilgtermiņa attīstības plānošanas dokumentā *Latvijas ilgtspējīgas attīstības stratēģija līdz 2030. gada*²³ klimata pārmaiņas atzīmē starp būtiskākajiem ar globālajiem procesiem saistītajiem izaicinājumiem, kas ietekmē tautsaimniecību un ekosistēmas, ekosistēmu pakalpojumus, dabas un cilvēka kapitālu. LIAS2030 īpaši attiecībā uz klimata pārmaiņu riskiem akcentēti Baltijas jūras piekrastē notiekošie krasta erozijas un smilšu akumulācijas procesi.

*Latvijas Nacionālajā attīstības plānā 2021.-2027. gadam*²⁴ kā viens no rīcības uzdevumiem ir noteikts mazināt klimata pārmaiņu ietekmi, īstenojot pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām pasākumus, panākot materiāltēhniskā un infrastruktūras nodrošinājuma uzlabojumus tautsaimniecības nozaru pārvaldībā, un ilgtspējīgā nokrišņu notekūdeņu apsaimniekošanā, ņemot vērā jaunākos zinātniskos datus un prognozes par klimatnoturīguma sasniegšanu un stiprināšanu.

gadā 17. jūlijā ir apstiprināts *Latvijas pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām plāns laika posmam līdz 2030. gadam*²⁵, kurā izvirzīti 5 stratēģiskie mērķi:

Stratēģiskais mērķis 1: Cilvēku dzīvība, veselība un labklājība, neatkarīgi no dzimuma, vecuma un sociālās piederības, ir pasargāta no klimata pārmaiņu nelabvēlīgas ietekmes.
Stratēģiskais mērķis 2: Tautsaimniecība spēja pielāgoties klimata pārmaiņu negatīvajām ietekmēm un izmantot klimata pārmaiņu sniegtās iespējas.

Liepāja

# Integrācija un horizontālie aspekti

Lai sasniegtu klimatneitralitāti, tiks ņemti vērā un integrēti šādi horizontālie aspekti visā plānošanas un īstenošanas procesā:

Veidota ciešāka sadarbība ar visām iesaistītajām pusēm, tostarp nozaru pārstāvjiem, pakalpojumu sniedzējiem, nevalstiskajām organizācijām, iedzīvotājiem un citiem.
Tādi principi kā "energoefektivitāte pirmajā vietā", "zaļais iepirkums", "inovatīvi finanšu instrumenti" tiks integrēti visā politikas plānošanas un īstenošanas kēdē ne tikai pašvaldībā, bet arī daudz plašāk, piemēram, rūpniecības uzņēmumos utt.
Turpmākās politikas un pasākumu priekšrocības un trūkumi tiks izvērtēti no vides, sociālajiem, ekonomiskajiem, finanšu un citiem aspektiem.
Visos plānošanas, ieviešanos un uzraudzības procesos tiks nodrošināta starpnozaru pieeja.

Papildus CO₂ emisiju samazināšanas mērķiem, Liepāja līdz 2030. gadam izvirza kvantitatīvus un arī kvalitatīvus mērķus enerģētikas un pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām sektoros, kā arī enerģētiskās nabadzības mazināšanai.

## 2.1.1 Mērķi enerģētikas sektorā līdz 2030. gadam

attēlā ir dotas Liepājas valstspilsētas kopējā enerģijas patēriņa izmaiņas kopš 2006. gada. Kopš 2006. gada pilsētas enerģijas patēriņš ir samazinājies par 15%, 2022. gadā sasniedzot 863 538 MWh. 2022. gadā lielāko īpatsvaru sastāda privātā transporta patēriņš (29%), siltumenerģijas patēriņš no centralizētās siltumapgādes (24%) un dabasgāzes patēriņš (22%).

## 2.1.2 CO₂ emisiju samazināšanas mērķi

attēlā ir dots kopējais CO₂ emisiju apjoms Liepājas valstspilsētā no 2006. līdz 2022. gadam. Kopš 2006. gada CO₂ emisiju apjoms ir samazinājies par 45%, un 2022. gadā tas bija 137 940 tCO₂. Sasniegtais CO₂ emisiju samazinājums ir skaidrojams ar nozīmīgu energoefektivitātes pasākumu īstenošanu katlu mājās un koģenerācijas stacijās, kā arī to pāreju uz atjaunojamiem energoresursiem. Kā jau minēts augstāk, Liepājā ir nosiltinātas arī lielākā daļa no pašvaldības ēkām, kā arī veikta virkne citu pasākumu. 2. pielikumā ir dota CO₂ emisiju aprēķina metodika.

attēls: Liepājas valstspilsētas 2022. gada emisiju apjoms

tabulā ir norādīts kopējais CO₂ emisiju samazināšanas mērķis Liepājas valstspilsētai. Optimistiskā scenārija gadījumā Liepāja līdz 2030. gadam samazinā s CO₂ emisijas par 80%, salīdzinot ar 2006. gadu. CO₂ emisiju samazinājums tiks sasniegts, īstenojot IEKRP2030 noteiktos pasākumus visos sektoros. Tomēr ir svarīgi piemināt, ka šo mērķu veiksmīga sasniegšana ir atkarīga arī no daudz un dažādiem ārējiem faktoriem, kurus pilsēta nevar ietekmēt vai var ietekmēt minimāli. Mērķis ir ļoti ambiciozs un bez citu institūciju atbalsta tā sasniegšana būtu problemātiska.

Citu SEG emisiju novērtējumam jau iepriekš ir tapis atsevišķs plānošanas dokuments kā Liepājas pilsētas gaisa kvalitātes uzlabošanas programma sagatavota, lai novērtētu gaisa kvalitātes esošo situāciju Liepājā, un lai paredzētu gaisa kvalitātes uzlabošanas pasākumus 2021.-2025.gadam.

Liepājas pilsētas gaisa kvalitātes uzlabošanas rīcības programma 2021.-2025.gadam (turpmāk tekstā – Rīcības programma) ir izstrādāta ar mērķi nodrošināt un uzlabot gaisa kvalitāti pilsētā. Gaisa kvalitātes mērījumu stacijas veiktie mērījumi parāda, ka lielākās gaisa kvalitātes problēmas un Pasaules Veselības organizācijas standartiem neatbilstoša gaisa kvalitāte Latvijas pilsētās konstatēta Rīga, Liepājā un Rēzekne. Liepājas gaisa kvalitātes uzlabošanas rīcības programa ir izstrādāta saskaņā ar Latvijas gaisa piesārņojuma samazināšanas rīcības plānu, 2020.-2030.gadam, kuru ir apstiprinājis Ministru kabinets 2020.gada 16. aprīlī ar rīkojumu Nr.197. Plānā noteikto pasākumu īstenošana palīdzēs nodrošināt ES līmenī noteikto gaisu piesārņojošo vielu emisiju samazināšanas mērķu 2020., 2025. un 2030. gadam izpildi un veicinās cilvēku veselības un ekosistēmu aizsardzībai atbilstošas gaisa kvalitātes sasniegšanu Latvijas pilsētās. Plānā iekļauto pasākumu īstenošana sekmēs arī siltumnīcefekta izraisošo gāzu samazināšanas un klimata ietekmes mazināšanu. Rīcības programa tiek analizēta esošā situācija un emisiju tendences, analizētas emisiju prognozes, veikta modelēšana, kā arī sniegta informācija par galvenajiem piesārņojuma avotiem. Uz izpētes rezultātu bāzes ir sagatavotas plānotās rīcības 2021.-2025.gadam.

Liepājas pilsētas gaisa kvalitātes esošā situācija tika novērtēta, izmantojot mērījumus laika posmā no 2021.gada februāra līdz 2021.gada jūnijam, ietverot sezonu bez apkures un ar apkuri. Tika apskatītas mājsaimniecību, transporta un ražošanas ietekmes, noteikta atbilstība normatīvo aktu prasībām un analizēti mērījumu dati, kā arī veikta gaisa piesārņojuma modelēšana. Esošā situācija nenorāda uz gaisa kvalitātes normatīvu pārsniegumiem, tomēr jāņem vērā pilsētas attīstība, tāpēc ir izvirzīti pasākumi gaisa kvalitātes uzlabošanai un monitoringam Liepājas pilsētā, ar mērķi noturēt gaisa kvalitāte

Liepāja

rādītājus vismaz esošās situācijas līmenī. Liepājas pilsētas gaisa kvalitātes uzlabošanas programmā ir sekojošas galvenās nodaļas: 1. nodaļa "Gaisa piesārnojuma raksturs un novērtējums" sniedz informāciju par tiesisko regulējumu Latvijā un Eiropas Savienībā (turpmāk – ES), gaisa kvalitātes normatīviem. Nodaļa apraksta Liepājas pilsētā konstatēto NOx, PM10 un PM2.5 daļiņu piesārnojumu, benz(a)pirēna un svina piesārnojuma rādītājus un salīdzina tos ar normatīvo regulējumu. Nodaļā apskatīts gaisa piesārnojuma avotu veidi un stacionārie gaisa piesārnojuma avoti. 2. nodaļa "Mērījumu rezultāti" apraksta veikto gaisa piesārnojuma mērījumu rezultātus šīs programmās izstrādes ietvaros aptvertajiem piesārnotājiem – slāpekļa dioksīdam NO2, cietajām daļiņām PM10 un PM2.5, poliaromātisko ogļūdeņražu piesārnotāju benz(a)pirēnu un smago metālu koncentrācijas. 3. nodaļa "Atmosfēras piesārnojuma modelēšana" un 4. nodaļa "Atmosfēras piesārnojuma modelēšanas rezultāti" sniedz informāciju par gaisa piesārnojuma modelēšanas rezultātiem. 5. nodaļa "Gaisa piesārnojuma teritoriālās kartes" – gaisa piesārnojuma kartes parāda gaisa piesārnojuma koncentrācijas un teritoriālo izplatību Liepājas pilsētā. 6. nodaļā "Pasākumi gaisa kvalitātes uzlabošanai" aprakstīti izvēlēte pasākumi gaisa kvalitātes uzlabošanai Liepājas pilsētā, un vērtēta gaisa kvalitātes pasākumu efektivitāte, vērtējot to kompleksi no kopējo sabiedrības ieguvumu aspektiem, kā arī apkopoti sabiedriskās apspriešanas rezultāti.

Liepājas valstspilsētas pašvaldība, apzinoties klimata pārmaiņu nopietnību, ir pievērsusies siltumnīcefekta gāzu (SEG) emisiju samazināšanai, neaprobežojoties tikai ar CO2. To parāda augstākminētā Rīcības programma.

Turpmākie pasākumi tiks tostarp vērsti uz emisiju samazināšanas mērķu paplašināšanu, iekļaujot ne tikai CO2, bet arī citas SEG.

Tiks veikts dzīves cikla novērtējumus, identificējot un kvalificējot emisijas no dažādām darbībām un nozarēm.

Ir uzsākta sadarbība ar citu pilsētu pašvaldībām, lai kopīgi risinātu klimata izmaiņu izaicinājumus un dalītos pieredzē.

## 2.1.4 Mērķi mazināt enerģētisko nabadzību Liepājas valstspi Isētā

Enerģētiskā nabadzība ar katru gadu kļūst arvien aktuālāks jautājums. Enerģētikas likuma 1. pantā sniegta šāda jēdziena definīcija – 10¹) enerģētiskā nabadzība — mājsaimniecības lietotāja nespēja uzturēt mājoklī atbilstošu temperatūru vai izmantot energoapgādes komersantu sniegtos pakalpojumus, vai norēķināties par tiem zemas energoefektivitātes dēļ vai tādēļ, ka maksai par šiem pakalpojumiem ir augsts īpatsvars mājsaimniecības ienākumos. Līdz šim pašvaldību (un arī valsts) līmenī nav noteikts enerģētiski nabadzīgo mājsaimniecību skaits, tāpēc bāzes vērtība tiek noteikta saskaņā ar Enerģētikas likuma 120. un 121. pantu, kas saskaņā ar Liepājas pilsētas domes Sociālā dienesta datiem ir 6,6%²⁶ (valsts plānošanas dokumentos valsts līmenī ir noteikts mērķa līmenis 7,5 %). Tomēr, jāņem vērā, ka faktiski enerģētiskās nabadzības definīcija ir plašāka un ietver arī tos iedzīvotājus, kuri nav reģistrēti kā trūcīgi vai maznodrošināti un neizmanto pašvaldības sociālo palīdzību, tomēr saskaras ar grūtībām apmaksāt rēķinus par saņemto enerģiju, vai taupības nolūkos mājoklī uztur temperatūru būtiski zem komforta līmenā. Nozīmīgs šis jautājums kļūst īpaši tajā mirklī, kad iedzīvotājiem ir jāpieņem kopīgs lēmums par daudzdzīvokļu ēku atjaunošanu. Bieži ēkas atjaunošanas procesā mazāk nodrošinātās iedzīvotāju grupas ir tās, kas finansiālu iemeslu dēļ baidās atbalstīt šo projektu un tie netiek īstenoti, kā rezultātā tiek ietekmēti ne tikai viņi pašu, bet arī pārējo iedzīvotāju labsajūta un maksājumi par enerģiju. Mērķi enerģētiskās nabadzības mazināšanai apkopoti 2.7. tabulā.

Mērķi enerģētiskās nabadzības mazināšanai

|  Mērķis | Mērķa gads | Bāzes gads  |

|  Nodrošināt, ka enerģētiskās nabadzības līmenis nepārsniedz esošo (6,6%) robežu Liepājas valstspilsētā | 2029 | 2022  |

## 2.2 Mazināšanas un pielāgošanās pasākumi

Klimata ietekmju mazināšanas un pielāgošanās pasākumi Liepājas valstspilsētā ir vērsti uz sešām galvenajām fokusa grupām (skat. 2.8. un 2.9. attēlus):

Pašvaldības infrastruktūras sfērā ir ietverts pasākumu kopums, kas risina jautājumus ar enerģijas patēriņa racionālu izmantošanu pašvaldības ēkās, ielu apgaismojumam un pašvaldības transportam.
Mājokļu sektorā ir iekļauti pasākumi mājokļu atjaunošanai un plašākai pārējai uz AER.
Transporta un mobilitātes sadalā ir plānoti pasākumi, kas veicinās ilgtspējīgu un videi draudzīgu transporta lietojumu un risinājumu ieviešanu pašvaldības teritorijā.
Centralizētā enerģijas ražošanas sektors iekļauj pasākumus, kas vērsti uz pāreju uz AER un jaunu patērētāju piesaisti.
Ražošanas un pakalpojumus sektors iekļauj pasākumus uzņēmumu energoefektivitātes paaugstināšanai un pārejai uz AER.
Pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām jomā ir plānoti pasākumi, kas veicinās pašvaldības izturētspēju pret klimata pārmaiņām, tai skaitā pasākumi, kas veicinās dabā balstītu risinājumu ieviešanu un arī CO₂ piesaisti.

²⁶ 2022. gadā mājsaimniecību skaits, kas saņēma atbalstu ar mājokļa lietošanu saistīto izdevumu segšanai bija 2129 mājsaimniecības jeb 2677 personas. 2022. gadā iedzīvotāju skaits darbspējas vecumā bija 40386 (saskaņā ar Centrālās statistikas pārvaldes datiem). Enerģētiski nabadzīgo personu skaits tika aprēķināts kā īpatsvars no personām, kas saņem pabalstu pret kopējo iedzīvotāju skaitu darbspējas vecumā.

## 2.3 Organizatoriskie un finanšu aspekti

### 2.3.1 Koordinēšana un atbildīgas organizatoriskās struktūras

Lai Liepājas valstspilsēta sasniegtu izvirzīto mērķi - nodrošināt klimatneitralitāti līdz 2030. gadam -, būs nepieciešama intensīvāka visu sabiedrības grupu iesaiste nekā līdz šim. Katrā no plānā iekļautajiem sektoriem ir izvirzīti noteikti CO₂ emisiju samazinājuma mērķi, par kuru kopējo sasniegšanu pašvaldības līmeni būs atbildīga Vadības un uzraudzības grupa, bet par apakšsektoriem - atbildīgas pašvaldības komisijas vai grupas.

Līdz šim par CO₂ emisiju mērķu sasniegšanu Liepājā bija atbildīga Energētikas darba grupa, bet, ņemot vērā to, ka pašvaldība parakstīs Klimatpilsētas līgumu ar daudz ambiciozākiem mērķiem, organizatorisko struktūru ir nepieciešams pārskatīt. Vispārīgā organizatoriskā shēma ir dota 2.10.attēlā.

Sadarbība ar visām grupām un komisijām  |

Lielākā daļa no 2.8.tabulā uzskaitītajām komisijām un grupām ir jau izveidotas, bet to pilnvaras ir jāpaplašina un jāiekļauj arī uzdevumu īstenot IEKRP2030 iekļautos pasākumus, kas ļau Liepājas pašvaldībai sasniegt klimatneitralitātes mērķi. Vairākas grupas būs jāizveido no jauna un to potenciālais sastāvs ir uzskaitīts zemāk:

Vadības un uzraudzības grupa: domes priekšsēdētājs un viņa vietnieks(-i), izpilddirektors, izpilddirektora 2 vietnieki, Liepājas SEZ pārvaldnieks, Liepājas enerģija valdes priekšsēdētājs, izpilddirektora padomniece IT izglītības un attīstības jautājumos, projektu vadītājs (klimata pārmaiņu un energoefektivitātes jautājumos);

Liepājas valstspilsētas ilgtspējīgas enerģētikas un klimata rīcības plāns 2023.–2030. gadam
Liepāja

Energoefektivitātes grupa: izpilddirektora vietnieks īpašuma jautājumos, Komunālās pārvaldes vadītājs, Attīstības pārvaldes vadītājs, Vides nodaļas vadītājs, Būvvaldes vadītājs;
Vides komunikācijas grupa: Izglītības pārvalde vadītājs, Sabiedrisko attiecību un mārketinga daļas vadītājs, nevalstisko organizāciju pārstāvji.
CCC grupa: projektu vadītājs (klimata pārmaiņu un energoefektivitātes jautājumos), Attīstības pārvaldes vadītāja vietniece, Attīstības pārvaldes Projektu ieviešanas nodaļas projektu vadītāja, Vides nodaļas Vides aizsardzības vecākā speciāliste, IT daļas IT pakalpojumu pārvaldības procesu vadītāja

Ļoti svarīgi organizatoriskajā struktūrā būs veidot atgriezenisko saiti un sadarbību ar CCC grupu, kas būs atbildīgā struktūrvienība par izvērtējumu, kā Liepājā mainās CO₂ emisijas un kā tā virzās pretī klimatneitralitātei.

## 2.4 leinteresēto pušu iesaiste

Svarīgi ir ne tikai pilnveidot un stiprināt pašvaldības organizatorisko struktūru mērķu sasniegšanai, bet iesaistīt visas leinteresētās puses. Klimatneitralitātes mērķus Liepājas pašvaldība nevarēs sasniegt bez plašas visu sabiedrības grupu iesaistes.

attēlā ir identificētas galvenās iesaistītās puses, ņemot vērā to interesi un ietekmi klimatneitralitātes mērķu sasniegšanā.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

## 2.11. attēls: Iesaistīto pušu kartēšana klimatneitralitātes mērķu sasniegšanā

Iesaistīto pušu iedalījums (2.11.attēlā):

Ar vidēji sarkanu krāsu grafikā ir identificētas tās puses, kas lemj un/vai var ietekmēt lēmumus politiskā līmenī, tai skaitā nepieciešamās izmaiņas normatīvajos aktos.
Ar gaiši sarkanu krāsu ir iekrāsotas tās pašvaldības organizācijas un struktūrvienības, kas pašvaldības līmenī atbild par kādu no plānā iekļautajiem sektoriem, piemēram, Liepājas enerģija ir atbildīga par CSS sektoru.
Ar tumši sarkanu krāsu ir iezīmētas dažādas iedzīvotāju grupas un tās atsevišķi iedalītas

Liepājas valstspilsētas ilgtspējīgas enerģētikas un klimata rīcības plāns 2023.–2030. gadam
Liepāja

pēc dažādiem nosacījumiem, piemēram, automašīnu īpašnieki, dzīvokļu un privātmāju īpašnieki. Katra no šīm grupām spēlē nozīmīgu lomu un katrai no tām arī jāizvirza noteikti pasākumi.

Ar tumši pelēku krāsu ir iekrāsoti rūpniecības uzņēmumi un pakalpojumi sniedzēji.
Ar gaiši pelēku – NVO un citas organizācijas.

Attiecībā uz iesaistīto personu iesaisti vismaz šobrīd ir definēti šādi galvenie izaicinājumi:

Ieinteresēto personu iesaistīšanās sabiedriskos procesos, tai skaitā klimatneitralitātes sasniegšanā un pasākumu ieviešanā.
Zems atbalsts valsts līmenī, lai vietējā līmenī ieviestu efektīvu politiku un pasākumus klimatneitralitātes sasniegšanai dažās nozarēs.
Finansējuma trūkums, lai nodrošinātu investīcijas visiem plānotajiem pasākumiem klimatneitralitātes sasniegšanai.

Katras iesaistītās puses iesaistei būs nepieciešami mērķēti pasākumi. Par to ieviešanu būs atbildīgas 2.10.attēlā minētās organizācijas. Pušu iesaistei pašvaldība izmantos šīs un citas metodes, ko izmanto pārējās 100 NetZeroCities pašvaldības Eiropā:

Mērķētas aptaujas, lai noteiktu mērķgrupu vajadzības un nepieciešamos atbalsta un/ vai stimulējošos mehānismus, piemēram, transportlīdzekļu īpašniekiem atteikties vai nomainīt uz videi draudzīgāku transportlīdzekli.
Regulāras tematiskās diskusijas, izmantojot, piemēram, dizaina domāšanas pieeju, lai mērķgrupas iesaistītu pasākumu īstenošanā.
Informatīvos un atbalsta pasākumus, piemēram, Energoefektivitātes nedēļa, Eiropas Mobilitātes nedēļa u.c.
Dalīšanās ar labās prakses piemēriem, piemēram, par dabā balstītu risinājumu ieviešanu plašāk.

tabulā ir dots sadarbību uzskaitījums, kas nodrošina labāku organizatorisko un pārvaldības aspektu iekļaušanu klimatneitralitātes mērķu sasniegšanā.

## 2.5 Budžets un paredzamie investīciju finansējuma avoti

IEKRP2030 ir iekļauti 17 pasākumu grupas, kuru daļēja īstenošana notiktu arī bez šī plāna, piemēram, iekārtu nomaiņa katlu mājās, videi draudzīgāka sabiedriskā transporta nodrošināšana un virkne citu rīcību. Jebkurā gadījumā to īstenošanai arī būtu nepieciešami finanšu līdzekļi. Tādējādi, investīcijas, kas nepieciešamas IEKRP2030 iekļauto pasākumu īstenošanai, nav jāskatās, kā tikai investīcijas, kas vērstas uz energoefektivitātes paaugstināšanu un/vai AER plašāku lietošanu, bet gan plašāk, jo tās vispirms sedz pamatvajadzības. Piemēram, daudzdzīvokļu ēku atjaunošana Liepājā vispirms ir vitāli svarīga, lai atjaunotu novecojušo un bieži līdz šim nepietiekami apsaimniekoto dzīvojamo fondu, nodrošinot tā drošību un atbilstību normatīvajām prasībām. Tikai pēc tam vai arī vienlaikus seko energoefektivitāte.

IEKRP2030 iekļauto pasākumu ieviešanai nepieciešamo finansējumu iespējams iegūt no dažādiem finansējuma avotiem: pašvaldības budžeta īstermiņa un vidēja termiņa pasākumiem; privātiem līdzekļiem ilgtermiņa projektiem, kas saistīti ar ēku atjaunošanu; ES struktūrfondu līdzekļiem pārējai uz AER un citiem ilgtermiņa energoefektivitātes pasākumiem, kā arī ilgtspējigiem transporta risinājumiem, valsts līdzfinansējumu, kā arī citiem finanšu instrumentiem, piemēram, EUCF³⁷. Tāpat, lai sasniegtu klimatneitralitātes mērķus, būs nepieciešams izmantot gan līdz šim mazāk izmantotus (piemēram, ESKO, publiskā un privātā partnerība), gan arī jaunus finansēšanas modelus, piesaistot ne tikai privātā sektora investīcijas, bet arī starptautisko finanšu institūciju finansējumu. Finansējums pasākumiem enerģētikas un klimata jomās ir iezīmēts Nacionālajā enerģētikas un klimata rīcības plānā (vairāk skatīt 1.nodaļu).

tabulā ir dotas kopējās indikatīvās investīcijas IEKRP2030 paredzēto pasākumu īstenošanai, iedalītas klimata mazināšanas un pielāgošanās pasākumos, kā arī atkarībā no finansējuma avota. Paredzētie finansējuma apjomi (229,23 miljoni EUR) var būtiski mainīties no izvēlētajiem tehniskajiem risinājumiem un citiem apstākļiem. Plānotie pasākumi ir detalizētāk aprakstīti 4.nodaļā, bet saraksts ar visiem pasākumiem ir dots plāna 5. pielikumā.

# 3.1 Energijas ražošana

Enerģijas ražošana Liepājas valstspilsētā notiek trīs veidos:

centralizēti – Liepājā darbojas centralizētā siltumapgādes sistēma, kas siltumenerģijas patērētājus nodrošina ar savās katlu mājās un/vai koģenerācijas stacijas ražoto siltumenerģiju, bet saražoto elektroenerģiju nodod valsts vienotajā elektroenerģijas tīklā;
vietējās katlu mājās;

Kogenerācijas staciju un katlu māju atrašanās vietas Liepājas kartē ir norādītas 3.4.attēlā. Ar sarkano krāsu ir atzīmētas lielas jaudas katlu mājas (virs 30 MW), ar oranžu – no 4 līdz 30 MW, ar dzeltenu – 1-4 MW lielas katlu mājas, bet ar zaļu ir norādītas katlu mājas, kuru uzstādītā jauda ir zemāka par 1 MW.

Liepājas pilsētas būvvalde 2023.gada otrajā pusē ir pieņēmusi ekspluatācijā SIA "Liepājas enerģija" jaunāko un videi draudzīgo šķeldas katlumāju Liepājā, Slimnīcas ielā 2. Jaunā katlumāja nodrošina siltumenerģiju 844 dzīvokļiem 15 daudzdzīvokļu mājās, kā arī Liepājas Regionālajai slimnīcai un vienam komercobjektam.

Īstenojot projektu "Fosilā kurināmā aizstāšana Liepājā", ir izbūvēts jauns šķeldas siltumavots, kas apvieno līdzšinējo autonomo gāzes katlumāju (Grīzupes ielā 89, Slimnīcas ielā 15 un Slimnīcas ielā 25) siltumapgādes sistēmas vienotā centralizētā siltumapgādes tīklā.

Šajā sadaļā informācija un dati par jauno katlu māju tiks papildināti laika gaitā pēc 2023./2024. gada apkures sezonas beigām.

# KOĢENERĀCIJAS STACIJA TUKUMA IELĀ 2

Katlu mājas rekonstrukcija Tukuma ielā tika veikta 2009.-2010. gadā un 2020.-2021. gadā. Šobrīd siltumenerģiju energoavotā ražo 2 ūdenssildāmie dabas gāzes katli:

KVGM 21,5-151 ar ražošanas jaudu 21,5 MW, lietderības koeficients 92,8%, ievadītā jauda 23,2 MW;

attēls. Tukuma ielas katlu mājā saražotā siltumenerģija 2006.-2022. gadā

Kā redzams 3.8.attēlā, saražotais siltumenerģijas apjoms šajā energoavotā pēdējo 17 gadu laikā ir mainījies: no 35,5 GWh 2006. gadā pieaudzis līdz 98,3 GWh 2012. gadā, bet pēc tam samazinājies līdz 10,4 GWh 2022. gadā. Tas ir skaidrojams ar to, ka 2008. gadā Tukuma ielas katlu māja tika saslēgta vienotā tīklā ar Kaiju ielas kogenerācijas staciju. Kopējie saražotās siltumenerģijas apjomi piecās iekārtās Kaiju ielas 33 un Tukuma ielas 2 energoavotos ir doti 3.9.attēlā.

attēls. Saražotās siltumenerģijas apjomi kopējā tīklā saslēgtajos divos energoavotos 2006.-2022. gadā

Kā redzams 3.9.attēlā, abas stacijas kopš 2011. gadā saražo vidēji 79% no kopējā pilsētas centralizētajā siltumapgādes sistēmā saražotā siltumenerģijas apjoma. Pēdējos 12 gadus saražotās siltumenerģijas apjomi ir stabilizējušies. Siltumenerģijas patēriņa samazinājums 2020. gadā skaidrojams ar Covid-19 ietekmi.

# KOĢENERĀCIJAS STACIJA KAIJU IELĀ 33

gadā tika veikta koģenerācijas stacijas Kaiju ielā 33 rekonstrukcija un tika uzstādīta šķeldas organiskā Renkina cikla (ORC) koģenerācijas iekārta ar siltuma jaudu 9,615 MWₜₕ un elektrisko jaudu 2,294 MWₑ. 2013. gada novembrī ekspluatācijā tika nodoti arī šķeldas ūdenssildāmie katli ar kopējo jaudu 30 MW (skat. 3.10.attēlu), tādējādi panākot, ka jau 2014. gadā 60% no kopējās saražotās siltumenerģijas centralizētajā siltumapgādes sistēmā tika nodrošināti ar atjaunojamiem energoresursiem. 2022. gadā šķeldas īpatsvars jau ir sasniedzis gandrīz 100% no šajā energoavotā kopējā saražotā siltumenerģijas apjoma.

## 3.12. attēls. Saražotās siltumenerģijas apjomi atlikušajās Liepājas valstspilsētas centralizētās siltumapgādes katlu mājās

Kā redzams 3.12. attēlā, saražotās siltumenerģijas apjoms arī šajās katlu mājās ir samazinājies no 86 GWh 2006. gadā līdz 45 GWh 2022. gadā. Lielākoties tas ir skaidrojams sistēmas optimizācijas darbiem, kad tika likvidētas vairākas katlu mājas, piemēram, Kapsēdes ielā 3, bet vairākās vietās tika uzstādītas jaunas.

## 3.3.2 Elektroenerģijas ražošana

Elektroenerģija Liepājas valstspilsētā tiek ražota iepriekš pieminētajās koģenerācijas stacijas. Kā redzams 3.3.attēlā un arī 3.13.attēlā, vietēji saražotās elektroenerģijas apjomi 2022. gadā strauji samazinājās, kas skaidrojams ar to, ka Tukuma ielas 2 koģenerācijas stacijai 2020. gada jūlijā beidzās valsts OIK atbalsts. Kaiju ielas 33 koģenerācijas stacijai tas beidzās 2022. gada septembrī.

attēls. Saražotie elektroenerģijas apjomi Liepājas koģenerācijas stacijas atkarībā no izmantotā kurināmā

Kā redzams 3.13.attēlā, 2012. gadā 11% no kopējā saražotā elektroenerģijas apjoma tika saražota biomasas koģenerācijas stacijā, bet 2022. gadā – 71%.

## 3.2 Enerģijas gala patēriņš

Enerģijas gala patēriņš Liepājā iedalās trīs sektoros:

siltumenerģijas patēriņš:
ēkās, kas pieslēgtas centralizētajai siltumapgādes sistēmai:
pašvaldības ēkās;
daudzdzīvokļu ēkās;

## 3.2.1. Siltumenerģijas gala patēriņš

Galvenie siltumenerģijas patērētāji Liepājā ir daudzdzīvokļu, pašvaldības un pakalpojuma sektora ēkas. 3.14.attēlā ir apkopoti siltumenerģijas patēriņi ēkās, kas ir pieslēgtas centralizētās siltumapgādes sistēmai, patēriņš ir sadalīts par apkuri un karsto ūdeni.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

attēls. Siltumenerģijas patēriņš ēkās, kas pieslēgtas Liepājas pilsētas centralizētās siltumapgādes sistēmai 2006.-2022. gadā

Kā redzams 3.14.attēlā, siltumenerģijas patēriņš pēdējos 17 gados ir robežās no 190 līdz 266 GWh gadā. Šo ēku īpatnējie siltumenerģijas patēriņi ir doti 3.15.attēlā.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

attēls. Īpatnējais siltumenerģijas patēriņš apkurei un karstā ūdens uajadzībām ēkās, kas pieslēgtas Liepājas valstspilsētas siltumapgādes sistēmai

Īpatnējais siltumenerģijas patēriņš ēkās variē no 50 līdz pat 482 kWh/m² gadā. Zemie rādītāji varētu būt saistīti ar to, ka ēkai tiek nodrošināta centralizēta karstā ūdens padeve, bet apkurei ir izvēlēts cits risinājums. Patēriņš ir atkarīgs arī no ēkas struktūras, kopējās apkurināmās platībās, kā arī no tā, vai ēka ir siltināta. Liepājā ir daudz sērijveida ēku, kas tika uzceltas Padomju laikos (1960.-1980. gados), bet tajā pat laikā arī vēsturiskās koka ēkas un pagājušā gadsimta sākumā celtās mājas (skat. 3.16.attēlu). Balstoties uz

Dabas gāzes patēriņš rūpniecības sektorā no 2009. gada līdz 2014. gadam bija stabilizējies 7,5-8,2 milj.m³ robežās, bet 2015. gadā salīdzinājumā ar 2014. gadu tas samazinājās par 19%. Kopš 2017. gada nav pieejama informācija par ražošanas sektora dabasgāzes patēriņu, tas ir aprēķināts, balstoties uz pieņēmumiem.

## 2.2.2 Elektroenerģijas gala patēriņš

No AS "Sadales tīkls" ir pieejams kopējais pašvaldības elektroenerģijas patēriņš par 2014.-2022. gadu. 2006.-2013. gada elektroenerģijas patēriņš tika aprēķināts, balstoties uz iedzīvotāju skaitu un vidējo elektroenerģijas patēriņu uz iedzīvotāju 2014.-2022. gados. Pilsētas elektroenerģijas patēriņš dots 3.20. attēlā.

Pilsētas elektroenerģijas patēriņš kopš 2006. gada ir samazinājies par 19%, 2022. gadā sasniedzot 204 511 MWh. 2022. gadā lielāko īpatsvaru sastādāja rūpniecības patērētāji (30%), aiz kā sekoja iedzīvotāju elektroenerģijas patēriņš (27%) un pakalpojumu sektors (12%). Patēriņa samazinājums 2020. gadā varētu būt skaidrojams ar Covid-19 ietekmi.

satiksmē ikdienā tiek izmantotas visas vieglās un kravas automašīnas, kā arī autobusi, kas ir tehniskā kārtībā;
satiksmē 5 mēnešu garumā ikdienā tiek izmantoti visi motocikli, kas ir tehniskā kārtībā;
vieglās automašīnas dienā nobrauc 20 km (365 dienas);
kravas automašīnas dienā nobrauc 50 km (365 dienas);
autobusi dienā nobrauc 50 km (365 dienas);
motocikli dienā nobrauc 20 km (150 dienas);
kvadracikli dienā nobrauc 30 km (90 dienas);
2006.-2009. gadā 64% no vieglajām automašīnām izmantoja dīzeļdegvielu, 33% - benzīnu, 2% auto gāzi un 1% atjaunojamos energoresursus;
2010.-2012. gadā 65% no vieglajām automašīnām izmantoja dīzeļdegvielu, 27% - benzīnu, 5% auto gāzi un 3% atjaunojamos energoresursus;
2013.-2022. gadā 68% no vieglajām automašīnām izmantoja dīzeļdegvielu, 22% - benzīnu, 7% auto gāzi un 3% atjaunojamos energoresursus.

Balstoties uz iepriekš minētajiem pieņēmumiem, 3.25.attēlā ir dots enerģijas patēriņš privātā transporta vajadzībām Liepāja 2006.-2022. gadā. Salīdzinājumam ir sniegti arī apkopotie dati no DUS 2011.-2022. gadā. Salīdzinot datus pēdējos 12 gados, ir redzams, ka aprēķina dati atšķiras vidēji par 27%/gadā. Tas ir skaidrojams ar to, ka Liepāju arvien vairāk apmeklē tūristu (vasaras festivālus, Karostu un citus objektus), kas uzpildās šajās stacijas, bet attiecigo degvielu faktiski izmanto ārpus Liepājas valstspilsētas teritorijas.

Kopējais energijas patēriņš sabiedriskā transporta vajadzībām 2012. gadā bija visaugstākais un sasniedza 16,4 GWh gadā. 13% no tā veidoja elektroenerģijas patēriņš tramvajam, bet atlikušais – dīzeļdegviela autobusu parkam Liepājas pilsētas maršrutos. Arī pašvaldības transporta enerģijas patēriņš visaugstākais bija 2012. gadā – 5,4 GWh, no kurām 69% veido dīzeļdegvielas patēriņš. Lielākais degvielas patēriņš 2022. gadā bija šādām pašvaldības iestādēm, aģentūrām un kapitālsabiedrībām:

SIA "Liepājas ūdens" (34,6%);
Aģentūra "Nodarbinātības projekti" (9,4%).
Pašvaldības policija (8,1%);
Sporta pārvalde (7,5%);
Liepājas reģionālā slimnīca (4,6%).

gadā pašvaldības transporta enerģijas patēriņš bija – 2,9 GWh, dīzeļdegvielas patēriņš sastādīja 81%, bet elektroenerģija – 19%.

## 3.2. Pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām

### 3.2.1 Klimata pārmaiņu risku un neaizsargātības izvērtējums

Klimata pārmaiņu starpvaldību ekspertu grupas (IPCC) piektajā Novērtējuma ziņojumā (AR5) pieņemti trīs siltumnīcas efektu izraisošo gāzu koncentrācijas izmaiņu scenārijī RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathways). Latvijas klimatisko parametru izmaiņas prognozētas atbilstoši diviem siltumnīcefekta gāzu (SEG) emisijas scenārijiem – RCP 4.5 un RCP 8.5. Arī plānā analizētie riski balstīti uz šiem diviem scenārijiem. RCP 4.5 scenārijam raksturīgas mērenas klimata pārmaiņas, savukārt RCP 8.5 scenārijam – nozīmīgas. Informācija par Latvijas klimata pārmaiņu prognozēm pieejama: https://www4.meteo.lv/klimatariks/. Liepājas situācijā izmantoti dati no Liepājas meteoroloģiskās stacijas un Liepājas valstspilsētas pašvaldības klimata profila: https://klimats.meteo.lv/pasvaldibu_apskati/valstspilseta/liepajas_pilseta/.

Ar klimata pārmaiņu scenārijiem tālāk dokumentā tiek saprastas LVĢMC aprēķinātās klimatisko parametru vērtību projekcijas nākotnes periodam līdz 2100. gadam Latvijas teritorijā, balstoties uz IPCC 5. novērtējuma ziņojuma Reprezentatīvās koncentrācijas aplēšu scenārijos (RCP 4,5 un RCP 8,5) prognozētajiem apstākļiem.

Līdzšinējo klimata pārmaiņu ietekmē ir paaugstinājusies arī minimālā un maksimālā gaisa temperatūra (skat. 3.28.attēlu), kā arī Liepājai tiek prognozēts būtiskā sala dienu skaita samazinājums, kā arī karstuma vilņu ilguma pieaugums, par spīti tam, ka Liepājas klimatu padara mērenāku jūras tuvums.

## 3.2.4 Klimata pārmaiņu ietekmē apdraudētā infrastruktūra un cilvēki

Liepāja atrodas Latvijas DR daļā, Baltijas jūras krastā. Tā ir lielākā pilsēta Kurzemes plānošanas reģionā. Liepāja atrodas 193 km attālumā no Rīgas, kuru ar Rīgu savieno A9 autoceļš. Liepājā atrodas arī osta, lidosta, un dzelzceļa savienojums ar citām Latvijas pilsētām. Liepājas teritorijas attīstības indekss 2020. gadā bija - 0,407.

Liepājā dzīvo vairāk nekā 67 tūkst. iedzīvotāju, no kuriem darbspējas vecumā ir 60,6%, bezdarba līmenis 2023. gada pirmajos četros mēnešos Liepājā bija 4,4%⁴². Pilsētas iedzīvotāju skaitam ir tendence lēnām samazināties, kas palielina pilsētas ievainojamību pret klimata pārmaiņām, nemot vērā, ka gados veci cilvēki vai tieši pretēji – bērni, ir mazāk pasargātās iedzīvotāju grupas un ir pastiprināti jūtīgi pret dažādiem klimata riskiem, piemēram, karstuma viļņiem. Ar dažādiem apdraudējumiem var arī saskarties tūrisma nozare, rūpniecības uzņēmumi un citi.

Pilsēta ir novietota piejūras zemienē, kā arī aizņem piekrastes kāpu valni. 23% no pilsētas kopplatības aizņem arī meži. Tieši zaļajām teritorijām un mežiem ir būtiska loma klimata pārmaiņu pielāgošanās un klimatnoturīguma kontekstā, jo tās palīdz stabilizēt vietējo mikroklimatu.

Pilsētas ekosistēmā nozīmīgu ekologisko funkciju veic ūdenstilpes – Baltijas jūra, Tirdzniecības kanāls, kas jūru savieno ar Liepājas ezeru, Tosmares ezers, kā arī Vērniekupe, Kalējupe un Ālande. Pilsētas teritorijā ir novērojami abrāzijas procesi, kuru rezultātā tiek noskalots jūras krasts, tajā pat laikā pilsētas dienvidu piekrastēs ir novērojami akumulācijas krasti. Pilsēta iekļauta Ventas upju baseina apgabalā. Viens no paaugstināta riska

objektiem Liepāja ir notekūdeņu attīrīšanas iekārtas, kas ir novietotas pilsētas daļā, netālu no abrāzijas krastiem.

Daļa no Liepājas valstspilsētas dzīvojamā fonda ēkām ir novecojušas un sliktā tehniskā stāvoklī un tāpēc vairāk pakļautas klimatisko apstākļu negatīvajai ietekmei.

Liepāja kopumā ir pakļauta augstam plūdu riskam, gan stipru nokrišņu ietekmē, gan jūras vējuzplūdu ietekmē. Plūdu riska zonās atrodas arī NAI un rekultivētā pilsētas atkritumu izgāztuve "Šķēde", kas rada paaugstinātu risku.

|  Sistēmiskā svira | Tehnoloģija un infrastruktūra  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | SIA "Liepājas enerģija" ir privāta kapitāla uzņēmums, kas gatavo biznesa plānu līdz 2030. gadam. Nemot vērā, ka Liepājas centralizētās siltumapgādes sistēmā vēl ir salīdzinoši lielās dabas gāzes katlu māju īpatsvars, kā arī siltumenerģijas pieprasījums nākamo gadu laikā samazināties, jo ēkas arvien vairāk tiks siltinātas, ir nepieciešams izstrādāt ilgtermiņa centralizētās siltumapgādes sistēmas koncepciju, izvērtējot dažādas alternatīvas atjaunojamo energoresursu plašākai lietošanai siltumapgādes sistēmā, ar mērķi 2030. gadā enerģiju ražot 100% no AER.
ES politika ilgtspejīgas enerģētikas sektorā tiek stingri virzīta enerģijas patēriņa samazināšanas, kā arī atjaunojamo energoresursu plašākas izmantošanas virzienā, atvēlot arī šiem pasākumiem finansējumu. SIA „Liepājas enerģija“ ir nepieciešams jau šobrīd prognozēt, kādu ietekmi atstās esošie un plānotie normatīvie akti, kā arī, kāds būs tās nākotnes biznesa modelis, lai spētu ilgtermiņā nodrošināt enerģiju par konkurētspējīgu cenu. Ir nepieciešams izstrādāt energoefektivitātes pasākumu un monitoringa plānu, lai pienācīgi sagatavotos un īstenotu ES energoefektivitātes direktīvas uzstādītos uzdevumus.  |

# 4.1.2 Jaunu siltumenerģijas patērētāju piesaiste Liepājas CSS

|  Pamatinformācija  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Sektors | Energosistēmas  |
|  Nosaukums | Jaunu siltumenerģijas patērētāju piesaiste Liepājas CSS  |
|  Pasākuma tips | Ilgtermiņa  |
|  Sistēmiskā svira | Pārvaldība un politika  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Liepājā ir lielš īpatsvars patērētāju, kas apkures vajadzībām izmanto individuālos risinājumus. 2022. gadā dabasgāzes patēriņš sastādāja 26% no kopējām pilsētas CO₂ emisijām. Nākotnē ir nepieciešams veicināt šo dabasgāzes patērētāju pieslēgšanos CSS.

Turpmāk līdz ar energoefektivitātes projektiem, kas veicinās dabasgāzes patēriņa samazināšanos, nepieciešams turpināt meklēt risinājumus jaunu patērētāju piesaistei CSS. Arī šis pasākums ir jāapskata ilgtermiņa centralizētās siltumapgādes sistēmas koncepcijā.

Tomēr ne vienmēr jaunu patērētāju pievienošana esošai siltumapgādes sistēmai ir ekonomiski pamatota. Šādos gadījumos pašvaldības var izmantot indikatorus, kas ļauj pieņemt sākotnējo lēmumu par turpmāku izpēti. Siltumapgādes sistēmu plānošanai praksē tiek izmantoti divi indikatori:
• siltuma slodzes blīvums (tam būtu jābūt vismaz 1,05 MW/km);
• siltuma patēriņa blīvums (mērķlielums – 2,5 MWh/m).

Pasākuma galvenais mērķis ir veicināt un nodrošināt ekonomiski efektīvu jaunu siltumenerģijas patērētāju piesaisti esošajiem siltumapgādes tīkliem visās pilsētas apdzīvotajās daļās.

SIA “Liepājas enerģija” klientu apkalpošanas mērķis ir katru gadu pieslēgt jaunus objektus, nodrošinot ikgadējo siltumenerģijas realizāciju ne mazāku par 200 GWh. Jaunu objektu pieslēgšanai ir vismaz jākompensē siltumenerģijas patēriņa kritums klientu energoefektivitātes pasākumu un iespējamo klimata izmaiņu rezultātā biznesa plāna periodā.

Papildus šī pasākuma ietvaros SIA “Liepājas enerģija” sadarbībā ar Liepājas pilsētas pašvaldības administrāciju ir jāizstrādā rīcības plāns, kā nodrošināt to patērētāju pieslēgšanu CSS, kas pēdējo gadu laikā ir atslēgušies. Tas ir īpaši svarīgi, lai nodrošinātu, ka esošā siltumapgādes sistēma netiktu likvidēta un dzīvokļu īpašnieki neuzstādītu Būvvalde nesaskaņotus individuālos apkures risinājumus, kas ilgtermiņā ietekmēs ēkas drošību.

Līdz 2030. gadam dabasgāzes patēriņš tiks samazināts pie CCS pieslēdzot 50% no mājsaimniecībām un komunālajiem lietotājiem un 40% no pakalpojumu un rūpniecības sektora patērētājiem.  |
|  Galvenie netiešie ieguvumi | • Ietekmes uz vidi un klimatu samazinājums

|  Nosaukums | Atjaunojamo energoresursu izmantošana pašvaldības un kapitālsabiedrību ēku siltumapgādē  |
|  Pasākuma tips | Īstermiņa  |
|  Sistēmiskā svira | Tehnoloģija/infrastruktūra  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | AER plašāka lietošana siltumenerģijas ražošanā, ir efektīvs veids kā samazināt pilsētas CO₂ emisijas. Pirms uzstāda AER iekārtas ir maksimāli jāsamazina ēkas siltumenerģijas patēriņš, paaugstinot ēkas energoefektivitāti.

Nesiltinātajās pašvaldības un kapitālsabiedrību ēkās, cik tas ir iespējams, tiks veikti energoefektivitātes uzlabošanas pasākumi. Iepirkumos jāiekļauj ne tikai energoefektivitātes garantija, bet jāparedz arī virkne citu priekšnosacījumu veiksmīga ēkas atjaunošanas projekta ieviešanai un ēkas apsaimniekošanai pēc atjaunošanas, piemēram, vienota visu iekārtu vadības sistēma.

Papildus ir jāveic pašvaldības iestāžu, jo īpaši izglītības iestāžu, ventilācijas sistēmu (vai to neesamību) un apsaimniekošanas izvērtējums. Ir jāizvērtē gan jau atjaunotās, gan neatjaunotās ēkās un rezultātus jāiekļauj nākamajos ēku atjaunošanas projektos. Turpmāk, atjaunojot pašvaldības ēkas, bet it īpaši izglītības iestādes, pašvaldībai tehniskajā projektā ir jāparedz un jāiekļauj ventilācijas sistēmu izbūve un uzstādīšana.

Neatkarīgi no ēku atjaunošanas projektiem, pašvaldībā ir jāizvērtē AER iekārtu uzstādīšana vai pieslēgšanās CSS tajās kapitālsabiedrību ēkās, kuras šobrīd siltumenerģiju nodrošina ar individuālo dabasgāzes katlu. Līdz 2030. gadam 50% no kapitālsabiedrību ēkām pāries uz AER iekārtām siltumenerģijas ražošanai vai pieslēgsies CSS.  |
|  Galvenie netiešie ieguvumi | • Ir novērtēts pašvaldības ēku un to ventilācijas sistēmu stāvoklis un energoefektivitāte
• Pašvaldība samazina izmaksas par enerģiju, ietekmi uz klimatu un CO₂ emisijas
• Uzlabota pašvaldības ēku gaisa kvalitāte un iekštelpu komforts

|  Pasākuma tips | Ilgtermiņa  |
|  Sistēmiskā svira | Tehnoloģija un infrastruktūra  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Augsts potenciāls CO₂ emisiju samazināšanai ir elektroenerģijas ražošana no AER, kas nosegtu gan pašvaldības ēku, gan ielu apgaismojuma elektroenerģijas patēriņu. Pašvaldībai ir jāizvērtē AER iekārtu uzstādīšana vai CO₂ kompensēšanas mehānisma ieviešana, piemēram, iepērkot atjaunojamo elektroenerģiju, kuras CO₂ emisijas ir 0.

Bieži tieši pašvaldības ēkās, kurās izvietoti biroji, enerģijas patēriņš veidojas dienas gaišajā laikā, kad arī ir vislielākais saules enerģijas potenciāls, kas ļauj iegūt saules enerģiju un izmantot to pašpatēriņam. Liepājas valstspilsētā ir lielis skaits pašvaldības ēku, kurās būtu jāveic saules sistēmu izvietošanas potenciāla noteikšana.

Saules enerģijas projekti ir ieviešami ne tikai pašvaldības ēkām, bet arī ielu apgaismojumam un ūdenssaimniecībai. Abās nozarēs vispirms jāveic energoefektivitātes pasākumi, lai maksimāli samazinātu elektroenerģijas patēriņu. Tas ietvertu arī ielu un ēku iekštelpu apgaismojuma nomaiņu.

Līdz 2030. gadam viss pašvaldības iestāžu un ielu apgaismojuma elektroenerģijas patēriņš tiks saražots no AER.

Tāpat atkarībā no attiecīgajiem Ministru kabineta noteikumiem, būtu jāizveido pašvaldības saimniecības energokopiena, kas nodrošinātu elektroenerģiju ēkām, procesiem, apgaismojumam, transportam u.c. Energokopienas darbība jāsaista ar ūdeņraža ražošanas, uzkrāšanas un izmantošanas potenciāla izpēti. Šajā procesā jāesaista arī Liepājas speciālā ekonomiskā zona.  |

# 4.2.4 Videi draudzīga pārvietošanās un pakalpojumi

|  Pamatinformācija  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Sektors | Mobilitāte un transports  |
|  Nosaukums | Videi draudzīga pārvietošanās un pakalpojumi  |
|  Pasākuma tips | Īstermiņa  |
|  Sistēmiskā svira | Tehnoloģija un infrastruktūra; Izglītošana un kapacitātes paaugstināšana  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Pašvaldības transports
gadā 30 pašvaldības iestādēm piederēja transports. To kopējais degvielas patēriņš sastādīja 81% dīzeļdegvielas un 19% benzīns, 2022. gadā radot 762 tCO2 emisiju.
Lai samazinātu pašvaldības transporta radītās emisijas, ir nepieciešams izprast un mainīt pašvaldības iestāžu un to darbinieku ikdienas paradumus attiecībā uz pārvietošanos. Ir jāsaprot ne tikai kādu transporta veidu darbinieki izmanto šobrīd, bet arī, kas viņus aptur izmantot videi draudzīgāku pārvietošanās iespēju, piemēram, doties ar kājām vai velo. Tai skaitā jāizvērtē situācija ar velo novietnēm pie pašvaldības ēkām.
Kad situācija ir izprasta, jāveic nepieciešamie uzlabojumi, piemēram, jānodrošina, ka pie katras pašvaldības ēkas ir velo novietne. Jāizvērtē vai jāmotivē tie darbinieki, kas dzīvo tuvu un dodas vienā virzienā, dalīt transportlīdzekli.
Uzlabojot pašvaldības piedāvātos e-pakalpojumus (skatīt pasākumu 4.2.5.) un turpināt iespēju nepieciešamības gadījumā darbiniekiem strādāt attālināti, iespējams samazināt to nepieciešamību pēc pārvietošanās.
Virzoties pretī klimatneitralitātei, pašvaldības autoparkā ir jāpalielina videi draudzīgu transportlīdzekļu īpatsvaru. Iepērkot jaunus transportlīdzekļus un/vai izvērtējot esošo transportlīdzekļu nepieciešamību un lietojumu, turpmāk jāapzina iespējas iepirkt elektromobīlus vai citus videi draudzīgākus transportlīdzekļus. Līdz 2030. gadam Liepājas valstspilsētas pašvaldība plāno nodrošināt visas pašvaldības autoparku (ja tas ir iespējams) ar elektrību. Iepērkot transporta līdzekļus, izsvērt iespējas tos izmantot kopīgi starp administrācijas struktūri piekām un iestādēm.
Inovācijas un tehnoloģijas
Tāpat jāturpina izmantot un ieviest citus videi draudzīgus un inovatīvus pakalpojumus tādās jomā, kā piemēram, atkritumu savākšana, ielu un pludmales tīrīšana, apstādījumu laistīšana u.c. Dažādu inovatīvu risinājumu testēšanai pilsētā būtu nepieciešams noteikt atbilstošas vietas un izveidot pilotteritorijas. Tāpēc vienai no priorātēm būtu jābūt šādu teritoriju izveidošana.
Pašvaldības saimniecībā, iepērkot jaunas iekārtas teritorijas labiekārtošanai, uzturēšanai u.c., vērtēt iespējas iegādāties elektriski darbināmas un videi draudzīgas iekārtas.  |
|  Galvenie netiešie ieguvumi | • Samazināts CO₂ emisiju apjoms un ietekme uz klimatu
• Samazinātas izmaksas par degvielu
• Pašvaldība rāda labo piemēru iedzīvotājiem
• AER izmantojuma pieaugums transporta sektora
• Vairāk pārvietojoties ar velo vai kājām uzlabojas veselība
• Atvieglota un padarita ērtāka darbinieku ikdiena  |

|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Digitalizācija
Transporta sektora emisijas iespējams samazināt ne tikai veicinot videi draudzīgu pārvietošanās līdzekļu izmantošanu, bet arī samazinot nepieciešamību pēc pārvietošanās. Pašvaldībai ir jāattīsta pašvaldības piedāvāto pakalpojumu digitalizācija, radot jaunus e-pakalpojumus, šādi samazinot iedzīvotājiem nepieciešamību doties uz pašvaldības iestādēm fiziski, lai pieprasītu un saņemtu nepieciešamos pakalpojumus.
Pašvaldības teritorijas un attīstības plānošanā arī nepieciešams ņemt vērā iedzīvotāju pārvietošanās vajadzības, piemēram, plānojot, kur atrodas izglītības iestādes, interešu izglītības un kultūras iestādes, sociālo un citu pakalpojumu iestādes, lai samazinātu iedzīvotājiem vajadzību pārvietoties garās distancēs.
Ņemot vērā, ka pašvaldība plāno ieviest dažādus mobilitātes un videi draudzīgas pārvietošanās veicinošus risinājumus, vienlaicīgi ir arī svarīgi par to informēt gan pilsētas iedzīvotājus, gan viesus. Pašvaldība to var darīt ar informatīvo kampaņu palīdzību, ko var organizēt sadarbībā ar sadarbības partneriem, to skaitā Elektrum, elektromobīļu dīleriem, Latvijas dzelzceļu, kaimiņu pašvaldībām, VARAM, tūrisma organizācijām, vietējiem uzņēmumiem u.c.
Tāpat būtu jāizstrādā viedās pilsētas ceļa karte, kur būtu ietverti arī dažādi viedie pilsētvides risinājumi. Jāturpina darbs pie pilsētas digitālā dvīņa izstrādes, pilsētas mobilās lietotnes papildinājumu  |

|   | ieviešanas, vienotā operatīvā centra izveides, pilsētas infrastruktūras aprīkošanas ar dažādiem sensoriem (gaisa kvalitātes, atkritumu konteineru piepildījuma apjoma, stāvvietu aizņemtības u.c.) un citi pasākumi, lai pilsētvidi padarītu viedāku.
Mobilā aplikācija
Lai paplašinātu iespējas iedzīvotājiem ērtāk nodot informāciju par uzlabojumiem pilsētvidē, kā arī veicinātu saziņu ar Liepājas pašvaldību, 2021. gadā izveidota mobilā lietotne ar nosaukumu “Liepājas pilsēta”. Sākotnēji lietotnē pieejamas četras funkcijas: informēt par nepieciešamajiem uzlabojumiem pilsētvidē, izplānot braucienu pilsētas sabiedriskajā transportā, iepazīties ar gaidāmajiem pasākumiem un saņemt svarīgākos pazīnojumus no pašvaldības. 2023. gadā lietotne papildināta ar saziņas iespēju ar Liepājas pašvaldības policiju.
Arī turpmāk plānota lietotnes attīstība un jaunu pakalpojumu izstrādē, piemēram, elektroniskie norēķini par braukšanas bilgtēm sabiedriskajā transportā, iesniegumu iesniegšana pašvaldības pakalpojumu saņemšanai, aptaujas iedzīvotāju viedokļa noskaidrošanai, mājdzīvnieku digitālā pase.
Digitālais dvīnis
Viens no viedpilsētas plāniem ir izveidot pilsētas situācijas attēlojumu reāllaikā ar iespēju sekot līdzi gaisa kvalitātei, satiksmes plūsmām, remontdarbiem, ēku energoefektivitātes līmeņiem u.c. parametriem, kas palīdzētu prognozēt pilsētas attīstību, pieņemt uz datiem balstītus ilgtermiņa lēmumus, ietaupīt finanses un resursus, operatīvāk reagēt uz problēmām. Jebkursī iedzīvotājs varētu sekot līdzi aktuālajai situācijai, un tas veicinātu atbildīgu attieksmi pret pilsētā notiekošo.
Lēmumu pieņemšana un budžeta veidošana turpmāk ir jābalsta, ņemot vērā arī ANO Ilgtspējīgas attīstības un Zaļā kursa mērķus.
Līdz šim budžeta veidošanā, lēmumu pieņemšanā, saistošo dokumentu izstrādē utml. nav pietiekami ņemti vērā tādi kritēriji, kā rīcību atbilstība ANO Ilgtspējīgas attīstības mērķiem, ietekme uz klimatu un vidi, cilvēku veselību u.c. Tāpat arī līdz šim netiek pietiekami rēķināta atstātā CO2 ietekme, piemēram, veiktajiem infrastruktūras izbūves darbiem, dažādiem kopšanas un uzturēšanas pakalpojumiem vai pasākumu rīkošanai.  |

|  Sistēmiskā svira | Tehnoloģija un infrastruktūra  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | 2022. gadā ražošanas un pakalpojumu sektors patērēja 110 GWh dabasgāzes, kas radija 22 tūkst. tCO₂ emisiju. Tas sastāda 16% no pilsētas kopējā enerģijas patēriņa un 19% no pilsētas kopējā radītā CO₂ emisiju apjoma. Tas nozīmē, ka šis sektors ir būtiskis pilsētas klimatneitralitātes sasniegšanā.
Uzņēmumiem ir jānovērtē to esošais energoefektivitātes līmenis un jādefīnē pasākumi tā paaugstināšanai. Visiem komersantiem, kuri iekļauti lielo uzņēmumu vai lielo elektroenerģijas patērētāju sarakstā, atbilstoši Energoefektivitātes likumā noteiktajam gada laikā jāveic uzņēmuma energoaudits vai jāievies sertificēta energopārvaldības sistēma, vai vides pārvaldības sistēma ar papildinājumu. Šādus pasākumus vēlames veikt jebkuram Liepājas valstspilsētas uzņēmumam ar iespējām uzlabot tā energoefektivitāti.
Šī pasākuma mērķis ir panākt līdz 2030. gadam dabasgāzes patēriņa samazinājumu ražošanas un pakalpojumu sektorā par 10%, veicot energoefektivitātes pasākumus. Papildus pēc enerģijas patēriņa samazināšanas (ja iespējams), ir jāapsver iespējas pieslēgties CSS vai pāriet uz AER.  |

|  Pasākuma tips | Īstermiņa  |
|  Sistēmiskā svira | Tehnoloģija un infrastruktūra  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Mobilitāte (ātra un ērta pārvietošanās) ir viena no svarīgām pamatvajadzībām ne tikai Liepājas iedzīvotājiem, bet arī tās viesiem. Pašvaldības mērķis ir nodrošināt pilsētas iedzīvotājiem un viesiem izdevīgus risinājumus, pārsēžoties no auto/velo uz vilcienu/ autobusu un otrādi. Tādējādi viena no pirmajām aktivitītām šī pasākuma ietvaros būs izstrādāt Liepājas un Dienvidkurzemes novada mobilitātes plānu, kas aptvers šādus aspektus:

• Veikt esošās situācijas analīzi, ievērot informāciju par transporta kustību un ceļu stāvokli. Tai skaitā jāveic Satiksmes intensitātes monitorings.
• Noteikt efektīvākos pārvietošanās veidus starp pilsētu un tuvajām apdzīvotajām vietām.
• Izstrādāt transporta attīstības alternatīvas, tai skaitā:
sabiedriskā transporta pieejamība, organizēšana, optimizēšana, modernizācija un popularizēšana (Skatīt pasākumu 4.4.2.);
mikromobilitātes infrastruktūras attīstība, tai skaitā mobilitātes punktu izbūve;
elektromobilitātes attīstība (skatīt pasākumu 4.4.3.);
satiksmes uzlabošana, izmantojot luksoforu darbības efektivitātes risinājumus;
ceļu kvalitātes uzlabošana;
izstrādāt pētījumu par autostāvvietu izmantošanu Liepājā;
satiksmes drošības un līdzsvarošanas risinājumu vadlīniju izstrāde;
pasākumi attālinātā darba veicināšanai un e-pakalpojumu pieejamības palielināšanai (skatīt pasākumu 4.2.5.);
informatīvā kampaņa par videi draudzīgu pārvietošanos;
pilsētas mobilās lietotnes papildināšana ar informāciju par dažādām mobilitātes iespējām un atbilstošiem maršrutiem.
tūrisma navigācijas zīmju autobraucējiem izvietošana pēc “Tūrisma informācijas un navigācijas zīmju Liepājā izvietošanas stratēģiskā plāna un dizaina”

Pasākuma galvenais mērķis ir par pilsētas transporta sektora attīstības un pilsētplānošanas galveno priorītāti izvirzīt iedzīvotājus, kas izvēlas videi draudzīgu pārvietošanās veidu.

Tāpat būtu jāveido tāda infrastruktūra, lai skolēni līdz skolām un bērni uz pirmsskolas izglītības iestādēm varētu nokļūt ērti un droši, gan ar kājām, gan ar citiem videi draudzīgiem pārvietošanās veidiem.  |

|  Nosaukums | Videi draudzīga sabiedriskā transporta pieejamība un popularizēšana  |
|  Pasākuma tips | Īstermiņa  |
|  Sistēmiskā svira | Tehnoloģijas un infrastruktūra  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Saskaņā ar Pašvaldību likumu, viena no pašvaldības funkcijām ir organizēt sabiedriskā transporta pakalpojumus. Lai samazinātu privāta transportlīdzekļa izmantošanu, pašvaldībai iedzīvotājiem ir jānodrošina alternatīvi pārvietošanās risinājumi, tai skaitā kvalitatīvs un efektīvs sabiedriskais transports.

Liepājā ir plašs sabiedriskā transporta maršrutu tīkls, kas aptver lielāko daļu pilsētas. Sabiedriskajam transportam ir svarīga loma pilsētas dzīvē. Tā plašāka izmantošana nodrošina mazāku gaisa piesārņojumu, troksni un arī ietekmi uz vidi, jo iedzīvotāji un pilsētas vies tādējādi var mazāk izmantot savu privāto transportu. Tajā pašā laikā sabiedriskajai transporta sistēmai ir jāatbilst sabiedrības mobilitātes prasībām.

Izstrādājot mobilitātes plānu (4.4.1.pasākums), tiks apzināti iedzīvotāju pārvietošanās paradumi. Tiks veikts arī padziļināts pilsētā esošo sabiedriskā transporta pakalpojumus novērtējums, novērtējot pakalpojuma pieejamību, efektivitāti un iedzīvotāju apmierinātību. Turpinājumā tiks veikta sabiedriskā transporta pieejamības uzlabošana, sabiedriskā transporta pakalpojuma kvalitātes uzlabošana, ritošā sastāva modernizācija. Kā arī nākotnes prognožu veidošana par potenciālajām izmaiņām sabiedriskā transporta lietotāju skaitā un esošās infrastruktūras nodrošinājumu. Tiks veikta sabiedriskā transporta maršrutu tīkla pārskatīšana un optimizēšana atbilstoši pieprasījumam un pilsētas attīstības tendencēm, lai samazinātu dublējošos maršrutus, sabiedriskā transporta nobraukumu un nepieciešamo sabiedrisko transportlīdzekļu skaitu.

Liepājā galvenās ielas jau ir izveidotas ar vienvirziena kustību, kā arī pilsētā ir uzstādīti vairāki viedie luksofori un izveidoti “zaļie” viļni. Pilsētā ir jāturpina darbs pie transporta plūsmas pārvaldības, kas iekļautu vismaz šādas rīcības:
• Cilvēku mobilitātes pētījums diennakts sezonas griezumā.
• Esošās luksoforu sistēmas pielāgošana pētījuma rezultātiem.
• Viedo luksoforu uzstādīšanas turpināšana.
• Digitālo sensoru sistēmas izveide.
• Citu/jaunu tehnoloģiju izveide.
• Vadības centra izveide.
• Pārvada izbūve.
Liepājā līdz 2024. gadam tiks izmantoti tradicionālie autobusi, kas atbilst Eiro 6 standarta prasībām, bet jau šobrīd pastāv citi risinājumi, kurus varētu ņemt vērā, plānojot Liepājas sabiedrisko transportu.

Viena no iespējām būtu izmantot integrēto pieeju, kas iekļautu gan ilgtermiņa atkritumu apsaimniekošanas jautājumu risināšanu, gan videi draudzīga sabiedriskā transporta pakalpojuma sniegšanu. Tā kā jaunākās tehnoloģijas paredz iespēju izmantot biometānu no atkritumu pārstrādes transporta vajadzībām, šis risinājums no ilgtspējas viedokļa ir aktuāls Liepājai. Cita iespēja būtu izmantot saspieto gāzi, ūdeņradi vai elektroautobusus (ar bateriju).  |

|  Nosaukums | Mikro un elektromobilitātes attīstīšana  |
|  Pasākuma tips | Īstermiņa  |
|  Sistēmiskā svira | Tehnoloģija/infrastruktūra  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Viens no Liepājas valstspilsētas mērķiem ir nodrošināt tās iedzīvotājiem un viesiem ērtu, ātru un vieglu pārvietošanos pilsētas teritorijā par pievilcīgu cenu. Tādējādi kā viens no vidēja termiņa attīstības virzieniem ir ne tikai velosipēdu, bet elektrovelosipēdu attīstība, kas notiek arī citās Eiropas pilsētās, piemēram, Tartu.
Galvenie elektrovelosipēdu lietotāji būtu studenti, mikrorajonu un centra iedzīvotāji, kas pārvietojas centrā, kā arī pilsētas viesi.
Lai šo pasākumu veiksmīgi ieviestu, būtu nepieciešams īstenot vismaz šādas aktivitātes:
• privātā transporta plūsmas ierobežošana pilsētas centrā;
• ātruma samazināšana un eksperimentāla ielu slēgšana autotransportam (vai dota priekšroka gājējiem/velosipēdistiem) uz laiku vai autobraucēju novirzīšana pa apkārtceļiem;
• apzināt iedzīvotāju un pilsētas viesu pārvietošanās vajadzības;
• Park&Bike attīstīšana, paredzot arī statīvus visiem velosipēdiem;
• velosipēdu dalīšanās pakalpojuma ieviešana pilsētā;
• elektrovelosipēdu izmantošanas un infrastruktūras (piemēram, novietnes) integrācija sabiedriskā transporta tīklā, kā arī iespēja dažādos transporta līdzekļu veidos izmantot vienotu bīļeti;  |

|   | • velo infrastruktūras attīstīšana (seguma kvalitāte, tīkls); • servisa punktu izveidošana pilsētā; • elektrovelosipēdu, elektroskūteru un elektromobilu lietošanas noteikumu pielāgošana pilsētas vajadzībām; • risinājumi drošai velosipēdu uzglabāšanai daudzdzīvokļu ēkās vai pie tām. Turklāt pašvaldība izskata iespēju paplašināt parasto un elektrisko velosipēdu sistēmu visā pašvaldībā, integrējot to arī ar sabiedriskā transporta biļetēm. Nemot vērā arī elektrotransporta attīstību, sadarbībā ar valsts institūcijām un citām nozīmīgākajām iesaistītajām pusēm, piemēram, degvielas uzpildes staciju operatoriem, tirdzniecības centriem utt. pilsētā ir jāplāno ērta, pārdomāta un pieejama elektrouzlādes staciju attīstība pie nozīmīgiem objektiem. Jāizvērtē arī iespēja tehniski savienot elektroauto uzlādes stacijas ar tramvaju infrastruktūru. Papildus šī pasākuma ietvaros ir jāveido sadarbība arī Rīgas valstspilsētas pašvaldību starppilsētu pārvietošanās efektivizācijā. Elektroauto uzlādes infrastruktūras attīstībai, Liepājas valstspilsētas pašvaldība ir izstrādājusi uzlādes staciju izvietojuma plānu un rīko izsoles uzlādes staciju izbūvei. Ir pieejama arī elektroauto uzlādes vietu karte pilsētas mobilajā lietotnē. Tāpat jāturpina pētīt dažādu citu inovatīvu mobilitātes risinājumu izmantošanu, ko ievies citas pilsētas un pašvaldības Eiropā un citviet pasaulē. Šī plāna ietvaros līdz 2030. gadam ir plānots samazināt privāto transportlīdzekļu izmantošanu par 15 tūkstošiem transportlīdzekļu.  |

## 4.5 Pasākumi mājokļu sektorā

### 4.5.1 Daudzdzīvokļu ēku atjaunošana

|  Pamatinformācija  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Sektors | Apbūve  |
|  Nosaukums | Daudzdzīvokļu ēku atjaunošana  |
|  Pasākuma tips | Ilgtermiņa  |
|  Sistēmiskā svira | Tehnoloģija/infrastruktūra  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Pilsētā liela daļa dzīvojamo ēku ir daudzdzīvokļu sērijveida ēkas, kuru tehniskais stāvoklis pasliktinās un ekspluatācijas termiņš tuvojas beigām, un tās ir nepieciešams atjaunot. Pētījumi rāda, ka daudzdzīvokļu ēkām Latvijā ir nepieciešama visaptveroša atjaunošana. Pēc Liepājas valstspilsētas pašvaldības rīcībā esošās informācijas, no kopā aptuveni 600 atjaunojamajām daudzdzīvokļu ēkām, līdz 2024. gadam būs atjaunotas 200 ēkas.

gadā daudzdzīvokļu ēku atjaunošanas temps ir krietni samazinājies, tostarp Ekonomikas ministrijas atbalsta programmas pārtraukuma un nepievilcīgo nosacījumu dēļ. Lai gan Liepājā ir lielākais atjaunoto ēku īpatsvars salīdzinot ar citām valstspilsētām, tomēr ar to mērķi nebeidzas. Tieši pretēji – šīs process būtu jāpaātrina un jāveicina, tāpēc Liepāja iesaistās jaunu nacionālu atbalsta mehānismu izstrādē.

Liepājas valstspilsētas pašvaldība sadarbībā ar namu apsaimniekotājiem, energoefektivitātes pakalpojuma sniedzējiem (ESKO), kā arī finanšu institūcijām un citām ieinteresētajām pusēm diskutē un piedāvā atbildīgajai ministrijai risinājumus, kā kopīgi veicināt un panākt daudzdzīvokļu ēku atjaunošanu un enerģijas patēriņa samazinājumu ne tikai pilsētā, bet visā valstī.

Paralēli tiek risināts jautājums, kā nodrošināt iedzīvotājiem jaunus, energoefektīvus un ērtus mājokļus gan variantā kā zemas īres, gan iegādei.

Turpmāk ir nepieciešams veikt padziļinātāku analīzi attiecībā uz pilsētas daudzdzīvokļu ēku esošo situāciju un identificēt prioritārās ēkas, kuras ir nepieciešams atjaunot. Augstāka prioritāte ir ēkām ar augstāku enerģijas patēriņu un/vai tās, kur lielāku īpatsvaru veido iedzīvotāju grupa, kas pakļauta enerģētiskai nabadzībai.

Lai arī plaša informācija ir pieejama internetā un pašvaldībā, pieredze un pētījumi rāda, ka cilvēki visbiežāk uzticas un ir gatavi sadarboties ar tiem, kuri nāk no pašu iedzīvotāju vidus. Tādēļ ir svarīgi, ka pašvaldībā ir viena šāda iestāde/darbinieks vai NVO, pie kura dzīvokļu īpašnieki var vērsties un katru reizi nav nepieciešams pieaicināt konsultantus no malas. Iestādes/darbinieka vai NVO kompetencē būtu šādi galvenie jautājumi:

• Informācija sniegšana un konsultācijas par siltumenerģijas un elektroenerģijas samazināšanas pasākumiem mājokļos, iespējām saņemt atbalstu AER tehnoloģiju izmantošanai, nodrošinot sadarbību ar pārbaudītiem jomas speciālistiem un pētniecības institūcijām Latvijā.
• Informācija un konsultācijas par daudzdzīvokļu ēku atjaunošanu (t.sk. atbalsts dokumentācijas sagatavošanai projektu pieteikumiem, atbalsts sociāli maznodrošinātajiem, u.tml.).
• Informatīvo materiālu sagatavošana iedzīvotājiem un to regulāra izplatīšana, sadarbības veidošana ar namu apsaimniekotājiem.
• Informatīvo pasākumu rīkošana.  |

Liepāja

|   | Lai gan par daudzdzīvokļu ēkām ir atbildīgi dzīvokļu īpašnieki, pašvaldībai ir nozīmīga loma to atjaunošanas veicināšanā. Liepājas valstspilsētas pašvaldībai jāizvērtē efektīvākie atbalsta instrumenti un iespējas turpināt sniegt finansiālu atbalstu, piemēram:
daudzdzīvokļu dzīvojamo māju energoauditiem;
tehniskās apsekošanas atzinumiem;
būvprojektu izstrādei. Papildus pašvaldībai ir jāmeklē arī instrumenti, kā dzīvokļu īpašniekus ne tikai motivēt ar atbalsta instrumentiem, bet arī uzlikt pienākumu savus mājokļus sakārtot (piemēram, ar saistošiem noteikumiem ēkām ar patēriņu virs 150 kWh/m2 gadā). Papildus pašvaldībai arī jāizvērtē enerģētiskās nabadzības ietekme un atbalsts jūtīgākajām iedzīvotāju grupām.
Līdz 2030. gadam plānots atjaunot 210 ēkas (35 ēkas/gadā) (atkarīgs no atbalsta programmas).
Papildus pašvaldībai jāveicina iedzīvotājiem izvēlēties iespēju uz daudzdzīvokļu ēku jumtiem uzstādīt saules enerģijas iekārtas elektroenerģijas un siltumenerģijas ražošanai, kā arī atbalstīt tehniskās apsekošanas atzinuma sagatavošanu.
Vēsturisko ēku restaurācija Pašvaldībai ir jāturpina atbalstīt vēsturisko ēku restaurācija un nepieciešamības gadījumā jāpapildia saistošos noteikumus.  |

|  Sektors | Apbūve  |
|  Nosaukums | Sabiedrības izglītošana  |
|  Pasākuma tips | Īstermiņa  |
|  Sistēmiskā svira | Sociālās inovācijas  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Būtisks aspekts iedzīvotāju motivēšanā un informācijas sniegšanā ir regulāru informatīvo dienu/ pasākumu/ semināru rīkošana par dažādiem ar enerģijas patēriņu, vidi un klimatu saistītiem jautājumiem. Informatīvie pasākumi var iekļaut, piemēram, Energoefektivitātes nedēļas un/vai Eiropas mobilitātes nedēļas rīkošanu pilsētā, kā arī sacensības un konkursus enerģijas lietotājiem. Pasākumi ir jāorganizē ne tikai pieaugušajiem, bet arī izglītojamajiem skolās un izglītojamiem pirmsskolas izglītības iestādēs.

Lai nākotnē efektīvāk iesaistītu iedzīvotājus un ne tikai tos, kuri jau paši par sevi interesējas par šīm tēmām, ir nepieciešams veidot citu pieeju pasākumu formātam.

Pašvaldībai un citiem iesaistītajiem informēt sabiedrību par aprites ekonomikas principu ievērošanu ikdienas procesos. Tāpat arī pašvaldībai censties ievērot šos principus un rādīt priekšzīmi par racionālu enerģijas un resursu izmantošanu, veicināt apkaimju iedzīvotājus un tūristus iesaistīties vides jautājumu risināšanā. Jāņem vērā arī plānotā sabiedrības līdzdalības budžeta izveide un tā sasaiste ar klimatnietralitātes mērķiem.

Kopsakarībā ar Liepājas kā Eiropas kultūras galvaspilsētas 2027. gadā topošās monitoringa matricas mērķiem, ir plānots izstrādāt un ieviest ekodizaina principus pasākumu rīkošanā un pakalpojumu nodrošināšanā.  |

|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Balstoties uz pētījumu “Mājsaimniecībās izmantoto apkures iekārtu apzināšana un risinājumu izstrāde informācijas uzkrāšanai”^{45}, 61% no visām ēkām Liepājā ir vienu vai divu dzīvokļu ēkas, kurās apkures vajadzībām lielākoties tiek izmantots cietais kurināmais (malka), elektroenerģija, dabas gāze vai citi kurināmie un potenciāli arī novecojušas iekārtas, kā rezultātā rodas gan lielāks gaisa piesārņojums, kā arī nelietderīgs atjaunojamo energoresursu lietojums. Lai uzlabotu gaisa kvalitāti, kā arī nodrošinātu racionālu energoresursu lietojumu, šī pasākuma ietvaros turpmāk būtu jāturpina šādas rīcības:

• konkrēto risinājuma izvēle un pielāgošana centralizēti vai decentralizēti;
• valsts atbalsta programmas izmantošana, lai pieslēgtos CSS vai uzstādītu AER iekārtas;
• privātmāju siltināšana;
• pāreja uz energoefektīvākām elektriskajām iekārtām;
• ieteikumi un izglītošana.

Tāpat ir jāturpina Liepājas pilsētas gaisa kvalitātes uzlabošanas rīcības programmas 2021.-2025. gadam pasākumu ieviešanu un gaisa kvalitātes monitoringu.

## 4.6 Klimata pielāgošanās pasākumi

### Pasākumu atlases metodika

Liepājas valstspilsētas klimata pielāgošanas pasākumi tika atlasīti, balstoties uz Latvijas pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām plānu laika posmam līdz 2030. gadam⁴⁶. Pasākumu atlase tika veikta, izmantojot multikritēriju analīzes metodiku.

Multikritēriju analīzē tika izmantoti šādi 5 faktori, kurus izvērtēja skalā no 1-3:

Efektivitāte: Vai vides un sociālie ieguvumi atsvērs finanšu un vides zaudējumus?
Steidzamība: Cik steidzama ir pasākuma ieviešana? Steidzami pasākumi, ir tādi, kurus neieviešot jau tuvākajos gados ir paredzami vides un/vai finanšu zaudējumi.
Praktiskums: Vai pasākuma ieviešanu ir iespējams integrēt pašvaldības ikdienas darbā, esošajā budžetā un plānotajās aktivitātēs. Grūti integrējami pasākumi ir tādi, kuru ieviešana prasītu veikt izmaiņas esošajās pašvaldības struktūrās, piemēram, jaunas nodaļas vai jaunu amatu izveide u.c.
Finansiālie aspekti: vai pasākuma ieviešana ir finansiāli ietilpīga, vai būtu nepieciešams meklēt papildu finansējumu?
Ilgtspēja: pasākums ir ilgtspējīgs, un saskaņā ar pilsētas vides, sociālo un attīstības politiku.

## 4.6.1 CO₂ emisiju piesaiste Liepājas valstspilsētā

|  Sektors | Pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām  |
|  Nosaukums | CO₂ emisiju piesaiste  |
|  Pasākuma tips | Ilgtermiņa  |
|  Pasākuma īss apraksts | Liepājas valstspilsētas klimatneitralitāte tiks panākta līdz 2030. gadam, samazinot CO₂ emisijas par 80% un nodrošinot atlikušo samazinājumu ar 20% CO₂ emisiju piesaistes pasākumiem.
Liepājas valstspilsētai 2023. gadā tik izstrādāts pētījums „Liepājas valstspilsētas siltumnīcefekta gāzu (SEG) emisiju un oglekļa dioksīda (CO₂) piesaistes novērtējums, prognozes un priekšlikumi“.
Pētījumā tika secināts, ka Liepājas meži līdz pat 2050. gadam saglabājas kā CO₂ piesaistes avots, tajā skaitā ogleklis uzkrājas dzīvajā un nedzīvajā kokaugu biomasā, bet koksnes produkti ir neliels emisiju avots. Paredzams, ka CO₂ piesaiste Liepājas mežos pakāpeniski samazināsies sakara ar mežu vecumstruktūras izmaiņām un vecāku mežaudžu īpatsvara pieaugumu. Šobrīd pilsētas meži var kompensēt aptuveni 7% no kumulatīvajām SEG emisijām, līdz ar to tiks ieviesti papildu pasākumi klimatneitralitātes sasniegšanai.
Pilsētas mežos var nodrošināt nelielu (vidēji 1,4 tonnas CO₂,₅₀, ha-1 gadā 7-15 gadu laikā), tomēr būtiska SEG emisiju samazinājuma nodrošināšanai jāizvērtē un jāveicina arī pasākumu ieviešana ārpus pilsētas teritorijas.
Perspektīvākie pasākumi, kuru īstenošanu neierobežo zemes pieejamība vai normatīvo aktu ierobežojumi, ir meža ieaudzēšana, it īpaši organiskās augsnēs, un ātraudzīgu kokaugu stādījumu ierīkošana lauksaimniecībā izmantojamās zemēs. Visu pilsētas  |

|   | SEG emisiju pakāpeniskai kompensēšanai, neņemot vērā SEG emisiju samazinājumu no organiskām augsnēm, būtu jāapmežo 5,3 tūkst. ha, bet, ieaudzējot mežu organiskās augsnēs – 1,8 tūkst. ha. Ierīkojot kokaugu stādījumus, būtu jāapstāda 3,5 tūkst. ha. Papildus atmežošanas radīto SEG emisiju pakāpeniskai aizstāšanai līdz 2050. gadam ir jāapmežo 0,3 tūkst. ha minerālaugšņu vai 0,1 tūkst. ha organisko augšņu vai arī jāierīko 0,2 tūkst. ha ātraudzīgu kokaugu stādījumu. Šī pasākuma ietvaros tiks meklētas un vērtētas iespējas palielināt CO_{2} emisiju piesaisti ar jaunām tehnoloģijām un inovācijā, kā arī vērtēta to izmaksu efektivitāte.
Nepieciešams veicināt zaļās infrastruktūras veidošanu un attīstību, kas ietver gan apstādījumu veidošanu pilsētvidē, kas rada noēnojumu, gan citus dabā balstītus risinājumus.  |

–2027. gadam 2.2.3. specifikā atbalsta mērķa "Uzlabot dabas aizsardzību un biologisko daudzveidību, "zaļo" infrastruktūru, it īpaši pilsētvidē, un samazināt piesārnojumu" 2.2.3.5. pasākuma "Gaisa piesārnojuma samazināšanas pasākumi pašvaldībās" ietvaros.

Kopējais indikatīvais finansējums 4.6.2. sadalās pasākumu īstenošanai ir 5 miljoni eiro. Atbildīgā par šo pasākumu ieviešanu ir Vides komisija sadarbībā ar Apstādījumu uzraudzības komisiju un Sabiedrības veselības komisiju.

Pielāgošanās klimata pārmaiņām Liepājā ir būtiska, jo pilsēta piedzīvo acīmredzamus klimata pārmaiņu radītus izaicinājumus, kas ietekmē gan vidi, veselību, gan sabiedrības drošību. Šī pielāgošanās sadalā ir izstrādāta, nemot vērā konkrētos riskus, kas saistītas ar klimata pārmaiņām. Identificētie pasākumi atbilst konkrētām klimata pārmaiņu ietekmēm, piemēram, ekstrēmiem laikapstākļiem, palielinātam krasta erozijas riskam, kas var radīt draudus iedzīvotāju drošībai un sabiedriskajai infrastruktūrai. Iekļautie pasākumi, piemēram, agrīnās brīdināšanas sistēmas un piekļuves uzlabošana pieejamam dzeramam ūdenim, ir tieši saistīti ar sabiedrības drošību un veselību. Tas palīdzēs samazināt negatīvo ietekmi uz iedzīvotāju veselību un uzlabot drošību ekstrēmos laikapstākļos. Ietvertie pasākumi, piemēram, zaļās infrastruktūras veicināšana un meliorācijas sistēmu uzturēšana, nodrošina aizsardzību pret klimata pārmaiņu radītajiem riskiem un veicina vides un biologiskās daudzveidības ilgtspējīgu attīstību.

Plānotais 5 miljonu eiro ieguldījums šo pasākumu īstenošanai ir svarīgs, jo lauj realizēt pasākumus, kas nepieciešami ilgtspējīgai pilsētas attīstībai un aizsardzībai pret klimata pārmaiņu radītajām sekām. Kā piemēri no citām pasaules pilsētām, kas ir veikušas līdzīgus pasākumus, piemēram, Kopenhāgena, Dānijā ir veiksmīgi īstenojusi zaļās infrastruktūras projektus, kas stiprina pilsētas izturību pret klimata pārmaiņām un plāno īstenot 50 gadu ilgu projektu, uzbūvējot vairāk kā 100 ha lielu pussalu, aizsargājot Kopenhāgenu pret ūdens līmena celšanās jūrā. Amsterdam, Niderlandē ir ieviesusi integrētu plūdu pārvaldības sistēmu, ietverot zaļo infrastruktūru, kuras mērķis ir absorbēt lietus ūdeni. Dažās pilsētas daļās ir izveidoti dārzi un parki, kas kalpo kā ūdens uzkrāšanas un attīrīšanas vietas, samazinot plūdu risku un veicinot biologisko daudzveidību. Mehiko, Meksikā ir izveidojusi pilsētas parkus, kas ne tikai kalpo kā zaļā infrastruktūra, bet arī kā pasākumi pret karstuma ietekmi pilsētas centrā.

Kopumā šie piemēri liecina, ka pilsētām ir dažādi riski un pilsētām ir ļoti laicīgi jāpieņem lēmumi par pielāgošanos klimata pārmaiņām, nemot vērā savas specifikās vides un socioekonomiskās īpatnības.

Tāpat turpmāk ir nepieciešams vairāk uzmanību pievēret izglītībai un informētībai iedzīvotāju vidū par klimata pārmaiņu ietekmi un katra iespējām palīdzēt mazināt tās sekas. Iedzīvotāju līdzdalība un sapratne ir būtiska veiksmīga pielāgošanās procesa sasniegšanai. Aktivitāšu īstenošanai un tēmas aktualizēšanai ir jāapvienojas dažādu nozaru speciālistiem, lai risinātu konkrētos klimata pārmaiņu radītos izaicinājumus. Tas ir svarīgs solis ilgtspējīgas un drošas pilsētas attīstībā nākotnē.

# 5. Plāna uzraudzība un monitorings

Pasākumu monitorings ir ļoti svarīga IEKRP ieviešanas sadalā. Regulāra datu apkopošana un analīze ļauj labāk sekot līdzī progresam un noteikt, vai izvirzīte mērķi tiks sasniegti laikā un vai nepieciešams ieviest kādus papildus pasākumus. Monitoringa ieviešana arī nodrošina atgriezenisko saitī – plāna ieviesēji var novērtēt, vai ieviestā pasākuma vēlamie rezultāti tiek sasniegti un, ja nav, veikt preventīvās darbības.

IEKRP ietvaros var izšķirt divu veidu pasākumu un rīcību monitoringu:

ikmēneša monitoringa aktivitātes, kas tiek īstenotas EPS ietvaros (par EPS uzturēšanu skat. 4.2.1. pasākumu);
ikgadējās monitoringa aktivitātēs, kas attiecas uz rīcības plānā pārējo iekļauto pasākumu un mērķu uzraudzību.

Par kopējā monitoringa veikšanu atbildīga ir Liepājas pašvaldības Vadības un uzraudzības grupa. Nepieciešamos monitoringa datus pēc pieprasījuma sagatavo un iesniedz atbildīgie pašvaldības speciālisti / struktūrvienības / organizācijas. Rīcības plānā pasākumu ieviešanas process tiek novērtēts, izmantojot 5.1. tabulā norādītos indikatorus. Papildus tam tiek veikts arī organizācijas, pārvaldības un sociālo inovāciju intervences pasākumu monitorings.

Indikatori iedalās trīs kategorijās:

Tiešās ietekmes indikatori (norādīti 5.1. tabulā treknrakstā, vairāk informācijas 6. pielikumā).
Netiešās ietekmes indikatori.
Plāna ieviešanas procesa uzraudzības indikatori:
4. nodalā uzskaitīto pasākumu uzraudzības indikatori ir norādīti 5.1. tabulā un vairāk informācijas dota 6. pielikumā;
organizācijas, pārvaldības un sociālo inovāciju intervences pasākumu uzraudzības indikatori norādīti 5.2. tabulā.

Monitoringa datī tiks publiskoti Liepājas valstspilsētas tīmekļa vietnē www.liepaja.lv. Pašvaldības iestāžu patēriņa datu monitorings jāveic un regulārī jāpublisko, lai:

pašvaldības darbinieki tiktu vairāk motivēti pievēret uzmanību enerģijas patēriņam;
pašvaldība rādītu piemēru pilsētas iedzīvotājiem.

Daudzdzīvokļu ēku, kā arī transporta sektora datus vēlami publiskot reizi gadā, lai arī iedzīvotāji tiktu informēti par sasniegtajiem rezultātiem. Monitoringa datus iespējams arī izmantot, lai noteiktu dažādu konkursu uzvarētājus. Sarakstu ar publicējamiem monitoringa datiem un to publicēšanas biežumu apstiprina Vadības un uzraudzības grupa.

Balstoties uz monitoringa datiem, katru gadu jāpārskata IEKRP iekļauto pasākumu nospraustie enerģijas ietaupījuma un CO₂ emisiju samazinājuma mērķi un, ja nepieciešams, jāveic korektīvas darbības.

# 2. pielikums: CO₂ emisiju aprēķins Liepājas valstspilsētai

## Emisiju aprēķina metodika

Bāzes emisiju uzskaite ir kvantitatīvs rādītājs, ar kuru nosaka to CO₂ emisiju daudzumu, ko bāzes gada laikā izraisījis enerģijas patēriņš Liepājas valstspilsētā. Rādītājs ļauj noteikt galvenos CO₂ emisiju avotus un to samazināšanas iespējas. Siltumnīcefekta gāzu emisiju noteikšanai ir izmantota Pilsētas mēra pakta izstrādātā metodika no vadīnijām „Kā izstrādāt ilgtspējīgas enerģētikas rīcības plānu“⁵¹.

Emisiju mērvienība ir tonnas CO₂ emisiju, un tiek aprēķinātas, balstoties uz apkopotajiem enerģijas patēriņa datiem. Siltumenerģijas gadījumā emisijas tiek noteiktas, izmantojot datus par patērēto kurināmā daudzumu siltumenerģijas ražošanai.

Emisiju aprēķināšanai no patērētā kurināmā apjoma (siltumapgādes un transporta sektoriem) ir izmantots vienādojums:

$$
CO_2 = B * Q_d^z * EF, tCO_2 \tag{1}
$$

radītais CO₂ emisiju daudzums, tCO₂
patērētais kurināmā daudzums, 1000 m³ (vai t)
kurināmā zemākais sadegšanas siltums, MWh/1000 m³ (vai MWh/t)
kurināmā emisijas faktors, tCO₂/MWh.

Emisijas no patērētās elektroenerģijas aprēķina pēc šāda vienādojuma:

$$
CO_2 = E_{pat} * EF, tCO_2 \tag{2}
$$

patērētais elektroenerģijas daudzums, MWh.

Zemāk sniegta informācija par izmantotajiem datiem un emisiju faktoriem katram sektoram.

## Izejas dati emisiju aprēķinam

CO₂ emisijas Liepājas valstspilsētai ir aprēķinātas trīs sektoriem:

siltumapgādei,
elektroapgādei un
transporta sektoram.

Zemāk ir apkopoti galvenie pieņēmumi CO₂ emisiju aprēķinam katram sektoram.

## Siltumapgāde

CO₂ emisijas no siltumapgādes sektora tika aprēķinātas, izmantojot vienādojumu (1). Emisijas no „Liepājas enerģija“ katlu mājām aprēķinātas pēc patērētā kurināmā daudzuma, izmantojot formulu (1). Emisiju noteikšanai izmantoti IPCC standarta, kā arī Latvijā noteiktie emisiju faktori, kas uzkaitīti P2.1.tabulā.
