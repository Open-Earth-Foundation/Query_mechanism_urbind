# Summary

An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CCC Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

This Action Plan is a document summarizing the work process on climate neutrality achievement. It shows the progress of Sofia Municipality in reduction of GHG emissions as of 2007 – the first year for which enough data are available. Due to the dedicated climate work since 2011 as reported to the CDP-ICLEI tracking platform and to the CoM for the implementation of the SEAP 2021-2020 and the SECAP 2021-2030, the baseline emissions for 2022 taken as a baseline for the development of this Action Plan are already nearly  $27\%$  lower than those in 2007. Despite this fact, emissions have to be further reduced to reach the target of  $81\%$  until 2030. The Action Plan aims at making a comprehensive review of Sofia climate policies and all strategic documents having impact on the process of reaching the climate neutrality target, to map the relevant stakeholders and expected challenges along the way. This Action Plan provides a calculation of the emissions gap taking into account the actions set out in the existing documents to reach a share of  $41\%$  reduction of GHG and the target of  $81\%$  to reach climate neutrality up to 2030. The additional share to be achieved by the complementary actions presented in this Action Plan amount to  $40\%$ . Sofia Municipality has presented a list of actions achieving a nearly  $90\%$  of the target. However, the city will complement the Action Plan with additional actions in the field of industry in the second iteration planned for year 2026.

A good network of stakeholders has been established and the communication is quite well developed. The transition team will take the role of a Monitoring Transition Unit during the implementation of the plan where the main leading role is taken by Sofia Municipality. However, the members from the national institutions and the private stakeholder will also have crucial roles in the process of implementation.

# 1 Introduction

Sofia Climate Neutrality Action Plan has been developed as a holistic document providing integrated vision of the measures needed to achieve climate neutrality and to adapt to climate change.

Sofia City has been systematically working for decades for the adoption and implementation of a goal-setting policy in the field of climate change and adaptation to it by defining and deploying multiple sectoral strategies.

This continuous process is an evidence for the firm commitment to the sustainable development concept and green transition.

# 1.1 Administrative territories

The city of Sofia is situated within the largest of Trans-Balkan valleys, the Sofia Valley, between the Balkan Mountain to the north and Viskyar Mountain to the northeast, Lyulin and Vitosha Mountains to the southwest, Lozenska Mountain to the south, and Vakarelska Mountain and Belitsa ridge to the southeast.

Sofia's geographic boundaries cover the territories of Sofia Municipality as an administrative unit being one of the 27 districts within the territory of Bulgaria. Sofia Municipality includes the city of Sofia, the towns of Bankya, Buhovo and Novi Iskar, and 34 villages. It covers an area of  $1,344.9\mathrm{km}^{21}$ , of which about  $256\mathrm{km}^2$  is urban territory, about  $89\mathrm{km}^2$  is transport territory, about  $464\mathrm{km}^2$  agricultural territories, about  $442\mathrm{km}^2$  forests, about  $52\mathrm{km}^2$  water &amp; water bodies, about  $14\mathrm{km}^2$  protected areas and about  $20\mathrm{km}^2$  disturbed territories. The shares of territories distributed by land use is shown in the below chart.

# 1.2 Administrative and political organization

Sofia Municipality consists of 38 settlements including Sofia City which covers 15% of the territory of the municipality. The municipality is divided into 24 administrative regions – 16 falling entirely within Sofia City, 5 covering both parts of Sofia City and outskirts and 3 regions including towns and villages out of the city but in immediate proximity.

The Sofia municipality is governed by a municipal council elected every 4 years. The Sofia Municipal Council (SMC) has powers over the entire Sofia Municipality, the main part of which is the city of Sofia. The municipal councilors, the municipal mayor and the regional mayors are elected by the residents of the municipality through local elections. The SMC determines the budgets of both the Sofia Municipality and the 24 individual Sofia districts.

Current organigram of Sofia City governance hierarchy is shown in the below figure.

# 1.3 Demographic and Socio-economic characteristics

# 1.3.1 Population

The population of Sofia Municipality as per the last census in 2021 is 1 307 439 people, where ca.  $96\%$  is urban population. This makes Sofia municipality the region with the largest number of citizens and the most densely populated one in Bulgaria.

Though traditionally the population of Sofia constantly increases, it follows the general national trend of gross decrease in population as shown in the below chart.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Figure 4 Population growth of Sofia Municipality, NSI
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

However, the population trend of Sofia compared to the preceding decades is positive and going up as the last censuses show that the population of the city has considerably grown in the last two decades.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 5 Population growth of Sofia Municipality according to the three last censuses, NSI

The same trend of increase is also confirmed by the forecast of the National Statistical Institute (NSI) for the Sofia municipality which shows a relatively steady trend of the population growth in the municipality in both optimistic and realistic scenarios for population growth with 0,2% average annual growth rate.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Figure 6 Population forecast within the boundaries of Sofia Municipality

Population in Sofia Municipality is distributed in 614 392 households (HH), 94% of which are in Sofia city. The average number of HH members is 2.0 persons.

# 1.3.2 Socio-economic characteristics

In the recent years, Sofia has played an increasingly significant role in the country's economy. It is supported by a longer lifespan and the long-term trend of the mechanical growth of the capital's population due to the good opportunities for education and realization in the labor market.

According to the Economic investment profile of Sofia published in 2024, in 2022 the share of Sofia in the national economy was above  $40\%$ . According to NSI data in 2022 the GDP per capita in Sofia amounts to BGN 53.75 thousand, which is more than two times the average value for Bulgaria. The economy of Sofia is traditionally strongly oriented towards the services. In 2022, the GVA in the services sector amounts to BGN 51.5 billion, which is over  $80\%$  of the added value in the economy of the metropolitan city. The gross value added in the industry reaches over BGN 9 billion, or about  $15\%$  of the added value in the economy of Sofia.

The economic profile of the capital is very different from that of the national economy. The processing industry accounts for only  $13\%$  of production in Sofia, compared to as much as  $33\%$  in total in the country's economy. The leading sectors in Sofia are trade -  $20\%$  of the production of enterprises and information and communication technologies -  $17\%$  of the production of the enterprises. Construction is also among the leading industries in Sofia's economy, bringing  $13\%$  of the output produced.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 7 Added value of enterprises in Sofia as a share of GVA of all enterprises in the country in selected sectors  $(\%, 2022)^4$

Economic profile of Sofia is complemented by the deep regional effect and the development of capital's peripheral territories. A number of industrial entities and logistic hubs are located out of the administrative boundaries of the city within the territory of neighboring and nearby municipalities.

Sofia Airport is the biggest airport in the country and it is situated within the boundaries of the municipality. However, it is used for airborne transportation out of the city boundaries.

O

Sofia's economic records a serious growth after the COVID-19 pandemic and the social restrictions in 2020. The long-term trend in the economy is constant, it concentrates over 40% of the country's economy, expands its periphery and accounts for a steady rate of economic growth.

In view of climate change and the influence of economy on it, the greatest emitters of GHG within the territory of Sofia Municipality are the buildings and the transport.

## 1.4 Existing Climate Policies and Strategies

Sofia city is fully committed to urban sustainability and innovation and stepped on this path yet in 2011 when the city joined the Covenant of Mayors. This led to the adoption of a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) setting a goal of 22% reduction of GHG emissions vs 2007, the first and the closest to 1990 year with enough data available to perform the analysis and calculations of the GHG emissions. Additionally, a Risk and Vulnerability Assessment has been prepared and a Climate Adaptation Strategy has been adopted in 2015. Another milestone in the transition path to neutrality of Sofia has been the adoption of a Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan and the accession to the Global Compact of Mayors for Climate and Energy in 2019. Together with the commitments to climate neutrality, the city of Sofia is also committed to environmental transparency and disclose its progress annually in the CDP-ICLEI platform for which in 2019 it was included in the 'A List'.

With the aim to make cities greener and more livable, in 2020 the EBRD launched the Green Cities initiative. With a decision of SMC, Sofia took this commitment and with the support of the EBRD, the municipality developed a Green City Action Plan defining the most important steps to turn Sofia cleaner, greener and healthier. In view of the goal for increasing the renewable energy in the energy mix of the city, a Short-term program for promoting the use of renewable energy sources and biofuels for the period 2020-2022 was adopted and implemented.

The final GHG inventory for 2020, for the reporting of the SEAP 2012-2020 outcomes, prepared in 2021, showed that Sofia had achieved 24,7% reduction that was higher compared to the target of 22% set up in the document.

Further developing its efforts to provide citizens a sustainable urban future, in 2021 the SMC adopted a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan for the period 2021-2030 that amplified the commitments to the Covenant of Mayors and became the main milestone in alignment with the Mission. This documents set an ambitious goal of achieving 40.6% reduction of CO₂ emissions mainly through reduction of energy consumption and increase of renewable energy in the final consumption. This document was supported complemented by the adoption in the same year of a Complex Ambient Air Quality Program for the period 2021-2026 thus ensuring the horizontal effects on the environment and human health.

The basic strategic document in the field of climate and energy in Sofia is the SECAP 2021-2030 and it sets the city's neutrality goals and targets summarized in the below graphic.

#

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 8 Target set out in the existing strategic policy of Sofia Municipality

The target set above covers the entire administrative territory of Sofia Municipality – all 24 administrative regions. However, the AFOLU sector, the airborne transport and the emissions from the networks for supply of NG had been excluded from the scope of the SECAP and from the scope of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions inventory since they contribute less than  $1\%$  to the total emissions of Sofia Municipality.

With the development, signing and implementation of the CCC, all existing targets will be brought in consistency to the new ambitious targets in view of sustainability and climate change. Thanks to the approach of engaging all parties, it will bring the possibility for constantly monitoring and changing if necessary the efforts in view of achieving climate neutrality and pave the path for Sofia to become a climate positive city and playing the role of pioneer to be followed by all Bulgarian or European cities.

The CCC will complement the existing strategies and the actions included in the portfolios herein will be implemented in parallel with all existing efforts towards climate-neutrality to address the emissions gap.

More efforts shall be made in bringing the GHG inventories in consistency to the requirements of the Mission by including all scopes (all sectors) and account for all the gases as per the Global Protocol of Community-based GHG and the Kyoto Protocol.

No actions have been envisaged in the AFOLU sector yet. It is to be further investigated and found how this domain could be addressed and what the most appropriate measures thereof are. This will be further developed in the next iteration of Sofia's CCC.

# 1.5 Work process

Sofia City has already made huge steps towards climate neutrality before becoming a Mission City. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that there is more work ahead in the future, and our participation in the EU Mission Cities will play an important role along this journey.

We believe shifting towards a greener economy is a major element of the transition to a net-zero emissions society, and it requires action on all fronts. Therefore, we in Sofia municipality, in our climate-related policies, focus on:

Renovation of buildings to make them more energy efficient – up to 2020 about  $50\%$  of all municipal buildings have been renovated by implementing common measures for better energy efficiency
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

Changing the inefficient transport fleet with a more environmentally friendly one – about  $40\%$  of the fleet has been replaced with non-fossil or more efficient vehicles.
Increasing the carbon sinks – we plant new forests in the municipal lands around the urban city, yet in 2019 we started the initiative “The new forest of Sofia” and currently over 40 000 saplings had been planted and are well developing.
Adapting to the circular-economy model - textiles, construction materials and electronics are recycled or re-used in order to decrease the use of primary raw materials and we are constantly improving our recycling management system and we are working hard on decreasing the waste at source.
Developing further the waste-to-energy production from bio-degradable and food waste and composting of material from pruning and green waste.

The present document is based on existing strategies and our above priorities, and will be fully integrated within the existing framework. The work process of its development followed strictly the recommendations of the Net Zero Cities project team and the Climate Transition Map and the Theory of Change Model proposed by it for implementing a just climate transition.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 9 Transition map to climate neutrality followed by Sofia Municipality

Since the CCC is an extensive integrated document, the most important step in the process was building a strong mandate. The political commitment has been set years ago and continuously confirmed and improved - a Coordination Unit on the energy efficiency and climate has been created yet in 2021 following the adoption of the SECAP in the framework of the CoM. The structure is interdepartmental and flexible. Another very important structure is the body formed to engage academic society in the process of climate change mitigation and adaptation of Sofia – the Scientific Council on Climate Change and Adaptation, where nine university representatives are engaged to support the decision-making and strategy development in the field. However the existing structures do not cover the ecosystem needs. Therefore a governance
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

structure involving national government representatives, NGOs, businesses and many other participants having relation to delivering carbon neutrality by 2030 has been established – a Transition Unit (Team). The Team is planned to greatly accelerate the city's ability to carry out climate policy, and to ensure its support from the community. Its composition and interactions are shown in the below figure.

A very important step in the process of development and implementation of the CCC of Sofia is the selection of appropriate actions to address the emissions gap.

The actions selected by Sofia to complement the strategic actions within the existing documents, yet following the policies set out toward climate neutrality cover four criteria. They are:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Immediately Actionable: could be launched by city staff within one-two years.

Achievable: proven and economically viable.

Impactful: leading-edge solutions that either make immediate, significant impact or enable large, longterm GHG reductions.

Relevant: corresponding to the requirements of NZC ToC and applicable for most cities with

similar social, geographic and political characteristics. These action may not always have a dramatic direct impact on citywide carbon emissions (even if significant for the city government's footprint). However, they are an important catalyst for others in the city and demonstrate municipal leadership.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 10 Target set out in the existing strategic policy of Sofia Municipality

This helped to work with all actors across the city for gathering information and data needed for the next steps in the process – understanding the system and co-design a portfolio. In this regard the following steps had been made:

# Step 1 - Updating GHG Inventory of the City

A comprehensive assessment of the domains of current greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, transportation patterns, waste generation, and other relevant data.
A comprehensive inventory report outlining the current state of emissions.
Analysis of the city's current sustainability initiatives and policies to understand existing efforts.

# Step 2 - Stakeholder Engagement and Mapping

Identifying and engaging the key stakeholders, including local government officials, community groups, businesses, and academic institutions.
Mapping out stakeholder roles, interests, and potential contributions to the CCC Action Plan.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

## Step 3 – Review and Analysis of Current Policies and Strategies

Reviewing and assessment of existing climate-related policies, regulations, and strategies at the local, regional, and national levels.
Identifying gaps, overlaps, and inconsistencies in the current policy framework.
Evaluating the effectiveness of current initiatives in driving climate action and sustainability.

## Step 4 – Analysis of the System and Identification of Risks and Barriers

Conducting a detailed analysis of city systems, such as energy, transportation, waste management, and urban planning, to identify barriers to climate neutrality.
Engaging stakeholders in Transition Unit sessions and discussions to identify systemic challenges and opportunities

## Step 5 – Development of the Action Plan

## Step 6 – Implementation and Monitoring

It is vital that citizens and stakeholders play a role and have a say in making the transition to climate neutrality a reality. This is why we at Sofia Municipality aim to foster engagement and co-operation between individuals, communities, and organizations, which will encourage people to commit to concrete actions to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions.

The transformation of Sofia into a carbon-neutral capital by 2030 relies on the **active involvement of and collaboration with all stakeholders**. Each of them plays a crucial role in this ambitious project, bringing unique perspectives and essential resources to ensure the success of this transition.

The stakeholders' involvement strategy of Sofia defines the role of the stakeholders.

The **key structures of the city** of Sofia are at the heart of the transformation. They are responsible for creating and implementing environmental policies, sustainable urban planning, public service management, and the renovation of municipal buildings. Their role is to plan, regulate, and oversee local initiatives, ensuring that the city's infrastructure supports the carbon reduction goals.

**National authorities**, such as the Bulgarian government and relevant ministries, play a crucial supporting role by providing necessary funding, establishing favorable regulations, and coordinating national initiatives with local efforts. This intergovernmental collaboration ensures a harmonized approach and strengthens the impact of climate actions at all levels.

**Municipal organizations**, including public enterprises and municipal management services, are essential for executing waste management, water supply, and public transport programs. Their participation ensures that the city's basic services operate sustainably and contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

**The private sector**, comprising businesses, trade unions, and business clubs, is a driver of innovation and investment in green technologies. By adopting sustainable business practices and collaborating with the municipality, these actors can develop and deploy environmentally friendly solutions, thus stimulating the local economy while contributing to carbon neutrality.

**Academic and research institutions** provide the scientific knowledge and technological innovations needed to tackle climate challenges. Their research and development are crucial for identifying new solutions, improving existing technologies, and training the next generation of climate leaders.

Finally, **citizens and NGOs** play a fundamental role in ensuring strong community support and raising awareness about climate issues. Their active participation through citizen initiatives, environmental advocacy groups, and community projects is essential for establishing sustainable behaviors and strengthening society's resilience to climate change.

In summary, the success of Sofia's climate neutrality project depends on a holistic and inclusive approach, where each stakeholder contributes significantly. Their collaboration and commitment create a robust and resilient ecosystem, capable of leading the capital towards a sustainable and prosperous future.

However, the commitment of several stakeholders is crucial to bringing about accelerated change and these include academic and research organizations, municipal structures and organizations and private sector, including citizens.

The strategy developed to engage and collaborate with stakeholders in Sofia as part of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan 2030 is based on a number of essential methods:

a. Dialogue and consultation with stakeholders:

Democratic Process: The formulation of policies and implementation of actions involve a democratic process that includes the active consultation and participation of all stakeholders.
Openness and transparency: All meetings and decisions made are documented and accessible to the public to ensure transparency.
Consultation and co-construction: Regular organization of public consultations, co-construction workshops, and discussion forums to gather feedback and ideas from citizens, businesses, and local organizations.
Periodic meetings: Establishment of periodic meetings with stakeholders to discuss progress and adjust strategies based on feedback and new information.

b. Sectoral strategies:

Specific sector approach: Development of sectoral strategies covering key areas such as energy, transport, waste management, and urban planning.
Dialogue with sector actors: For each sector, the municipality engages in dialogue with the concerned stakeholders to define policies and actions to be implemented. For example, discussions with businesses and energy cooperatives for the energy sector, or with resident associations for urban planning projects.
Expert participation: Inclusion of technical and scientific experts in discussions to ensure that policies are based on best practices and the latest data.

c. Energy renovation initiatives:

Implementation of a pilot energy renovation program targeting municipal and residential buildings, with technical advice and financial support for property owners and managers.
Collaboration with local businesses to develop innovative solutions for green heating and energy efficiency.

d. Engagement and participation:

Organization of regular consultation forums with stakeholders, including co-design workshops and feedback sessions to discuss climate initiatives and potential obstacles.
Creation of specific working groups for key sectors such as transport, energy, and waste management, comprising representatives from businesses, universities, and civil society organizations.

# e. Communication and awareness:

Robust communication campaigns using various media (social networks, radio, television, print media) to raise public awareness of climate neutrality initiatives and encourage community participation.
Use of local successes and best practices to inspire and motivate other actors to engage in climate actions.

# f. Financial and technical support:

Exploration of partnerships with national and international financial institutions and development agencies to secure additional funding for ambitious climate projects.

# g. Innovation and research:

Collaboration with universities and research center s to develop and test innovative emission reduction and climate adaptation technologies.
Support for pilot projects and demonstrations of new energy technologies, with a particular focus on solutions adapted to Sofia's local context.

This strategy is designed to ensure a transition to climate neutrality by actively engaging all stakeholders in Sofia, promoting cooperation and transparency, and supporting sustainable innovation and funding.

To step on a firm ground for developing the CCC, Sofia Municipality made a SWOT analysis.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The SWOT analysis of Sofia's climate neutrality action plan reveals a complex and strategic framework aimed at transforming the city into a model of sustainability by 2030. Sofia demonstrates strong political commitment, supported by rigorous alignment with European climate policies. This commitment is reflected in the development of a detailed plan designed to leverage existing infrastructure while actively involving local stakeholders. The city's existing infrastructure provides a solid foundation for improving energy efficiency and adopting green technologies, thereby reducing the costs and time required for implementation.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

However, Sofia faces several challenges, including administrative complexity and funding difficulties. Coordination between various governmental entities, as well as effective data management, is crucial to avoiding delays and maximizing the efficiency of initiatives. Additionally, reliance on external grants and funding presents a risk to the continuity of projects, necessitating careful financial planning and diversification of funding sources.

Public engagement is another area where Sofia could strengthen its efforts. Although the plan encourages citizen participation, the involvement of the entire population remains uneven, which could limit the effectiveness of climate initiatives. Increased awareness and citizen engagement campaigns could help bolster public support and ensure the success of the projects.

On the other hand, Sofia benefits from significant opportunities, particularly access to European funding and the adoption of new technologies. These external resources can catalyze the city's transformation, facilitating the deployment of large-scale projects such as energy infrastructure modernization and public transportation improvements. Technological innovation plays a key role in this transition, allowing Sofia to experiment with and adopt sustainable solutions that enhance urban resilience in the face of climate challenges.

However, the city must also prepare to face potential threats, such as the impacts of climate change, complex regulations, and political fluctuations. These external factors can complicate project implementation and require proactive risk management. Additionally, Sofia's aging infrastructure poses a major obstacle, necessitating substantial investments to modernize and align it with current ecological standards.

In conclusion, the SWOT analysis of Sofia's climate neutrality plan shows a city at a crossroads, with significant strengths but also considerable challenges to overcome. The success of this transition will depend on Sofia's ability to effectively mobilize its resources, overcome administrative and financial obstacles, and capitalize on the opportunities presented by technological innovations and European funding. The integrated and participatory approach adopted by Sofia could be the key to achieving its ambitious climate neutrality goals, ensuring a sustainable future for its citizens.

Another very important step in the process of development and implementation of the CCC has been made by Sofia – a risk analysis based on the ACT Methodology.

This analysis was conducted using the "ACT Step-by-Step" methodology, a structured approach designed to provide a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of risks and opportunities. The process of evaluation involving the following steps:

Acknowledge (A): This initial phase involves identifying and acknowledging all potential risks and opportunities that could impact the project. For Sofia, this meant systematically collecting data on political, technological, environmental, and economic factors that could influence the city's climate transition.
Consider (C): In this phase, each identified risk and opportunity is carefully considered in terms of its probability of occurrence and potential impact. This step involves detailed analysis, including scenario planning and impact assessment, to determine how each factor might influence Sofia's objectives.
Take Action (T): Based on the considerations, this phase focuses on developing strategic responses. For risks, this means creating mitigation plans, while for opportunities, it involves devising strategies to capitalize on them. The emphasis is on actionable steps that align with Sofia's overall strategic goals for climate neutrality.

By following the ACT methodology, Sofia's analysis ensures a thorough and well-structured approach to managing the risks and opportunities inherent in its climate transition. This methodology not only supports informed decision-making but also facilitates the ongoing adaptation of strategies in response to evolving challenges and opportunities.

Finally, the triangle offers a methodology for mitigating identified threats. By categorizing risks based on their probability and impact, it becomes possible to develop specific mitigation plans for the most critical risks. This includes preventive actions to reduce the likelihood of these risks materializing, as well as response strategies to minimize their impact if they do occur. This dual approach enables Sofia to strengthen its resilience to future challenges and ensure a successful climate transition.

In summary, the risks and opportunities triangle, informed by the ACT Step-by-Step methodology, is an indispensable tool for Sofia in its quest for climate neutrality. It allows for a comprehensive and nuanced assessment of risks and opportunities, thereby supporting informed strategic decision-making, optimal resource allocation, and proactive management of potential threats.

# 1.6 Next steps

The future steps comprise the process of review, monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the CCC with main milestones being the:

drafting of the CCC of Sofia City – July-August 2024;
submission of the CCC for informal review – August 30th, 2024;
official submission to the platform – September 16th, 2024;
1st review and iteration – July-August 2026;
2nd review and iteration – July – August 2028;
Final review – July-August 2030;
Final GHG emissions inventory – September 2032

Since due to the lack of sufficient data on industry, the baseline inventory is not reliable for this domain to be addressed through appropriate actions, so this first version is missing the actions that will be implemented by industrial stakeholders. This will be clarified and complemented in the first iteration in 2026 after the comprehensive inventory for the year 2024. This will also lead to complementing the GHG inventory by covering also the other gases as per the Kyoto Protocol.

In addition, we have planned some actions for which the emissions and investments will be calculated additionally and this is to be done in the first iteration in 2026.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

All other issues identified during implementation or additional actions proposed by some of the key stakeholders within the major emitting domains will be collected and included in the first and second iterations.

All indicators will be strictly monitored and certain decisions and steps will be made in view of changed conditions when indicators show any disruptions.

The final review will be made in 2030 to finally confirm the completion of all the planned actions and their outcomes.

The final inventory to be done in 2032 for the year of 2030 will prove the effect of the CCC and will confirm the completion of the target – achievement of 80%+ reduction of the GHG emissions.

Part A “Current State of Climate Action” describes the point of departure of the city towards climate neutrality, including commitments and strategies of key local businesses, and informs the subsequent modules and the outlined pathways to accelerated climate action.

# 2.1 Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

## GHG Emissions Baseline inventory

Sofia is a member of the Covenant of Mayors since 2011 and reports emissions inventories each 4th year. The monitoring of emissions is done vs the baseline year 2007. It has been defined as the baseline year (BEI) since this was the first year for which enough reliable data were available for the preparation of an inventory. The last reported to the GCoM inventory is the one for year 2020. Additionally, Sofia reports to the CDP/ICLEI each year since 2018, and in 2019 it had been enlisted in the A List of the platform when the data from 2018 inventory had been reported. Having in mind that year 2020 was characterized by unusual economic behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been considered appropriate to update the inventory vs 2018 inventory and year 2022 inventory has been prepared and taken as a baseline for the development of the CCC.

The decision to change the reference year of Sofia's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory to 2022 is based on several strategic and methodological considerations. The year 2022 provides a more current and accurate representation of emissions, reflecting recent economic, social, and environmental developments in the city. By adopting this year as the reference, Sofia aligns its climate strategies and actions with the most recent data and trends, which is essential for effective planning that is well-adapted to the current reality.

Since 2018, Sofia has implemented new policies and measures aimed at reducing its GHG emissions. By selecting 2022 as the reference year, the emissions inventory captures the impact of these recent initiatives, thus providing a relevant baseline for assessing progress made. Moreover, 2022 reflects the post-COVID-19 economic recovery, avoiding the anomalies observed in 2020 when economic disruptions related to the pandemic temporarily reduced emissions. The year 2022, with a return to normal economic activity, is based on data that better reflects the structural emissions situation in the city.

This change in reference year allows Sofia to align its emission reduction targets with recent international commitments, such as those defined by the Paris Agreement. The city's efforts are part of a global dynamic towards carbon neutrality. Additionally, data collection methods and GHG emissions monitoring technologies have significantly evolved between 2018 and 2022. By using 2022 as the new baseline, Sofia benefits from these methodological and technological improvements, ensuring that the inventory is based on the most accurate and reliable data available.

The shift to 2022 as the reference year is a strategic decision that enables Sofia to establish a solid and up-to-date basis for evaluating and planning its actions towards achieving carbon neutrality, while taking into account recent changes and advancements made in recent years.

Sofia Municipality has undertaken a GHG inventory for the year 2022, aligning with its commitments under the Covenant of Mayors European initiative and the Global Compact of Mayors for Climate and Energy. This inventory utilized methodologies from the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans

Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

#

(SECAPs) guidelines, specifically Part II on Basic Emissions Inventory, the Global Protocol for GHG Emissions Inventory, and the IPCC's 2006 Guide for National GHG Inventories. It is done on the grounds of the final energy consumption within the administrative boundaries of Sofia Municipality.

The inventory encompasses several sectors: stationary energy - residential, tertiary and municipal buildings, equipment and facilities; industry and construction; agriculture and forestry; accidental emissions from natural gas supply; transportation (road, rail, and aviation), and waste and wastewater management. Data was gathered from municipal sources as well as numerous public and private organizations. The inventory covers all 24 administrative regions within the municipality.

In terms of energy consumption, the total for the municipality has been estimated to 10,060,567 MWh in 2022, a reduction of  $12\%$  from 11,437,985 MWh in 2018.

Regarding emissions, the total for 2022 has been evaluated to amount to 4.2 million tons of CO2-equivalent, down from 4.6 million tons in 2018, reflecting a decrease of  $8\%$ . Households  $(43\%)$ , industry  $(21\%)$ , road transport  $(16\%)$  and trade and services  $(13\%)$  being, in that order, the prominent sources of emissions.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 11 Shares of GHG emissions by sector within Sofia Municipality

The GHG inventory covers all major sectors contributing to emissions within the municipality, including households, industry, road transport, trade and services, as well as municipal buildings. It is conducted in accordance with established methodologies, ensuring that all relevant emission sources are accounted for. However, we did not include data related to emissions from local flights and food products consumed in Sofia in this inventory. This exclusion does not, however, present any significant potential impact and does not constitute an obstacle to Sofia's goal of climate neutrality. These emission sources are relatively limited, and their overall contribution to the municipality's total emissions is negligible. Therefore, their omission does not compromise the validity of the inventory nor the achievement of the city's ambitious climate goals.

Natural gas networks and air transport contributed less than  $1\%$  of Sofia's total emissions in 2018, and have been excluded from the scope of the baseline greenhouse gas inventory.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

The available GHG emission inventory for Sofia meets the core requirements set forth in the Cities Mission's Info Kit for Cities. The inventory was prepared using the methodologies aligned with the Covenant of Mayors, the Global Protocol for Community-based GHG Emissions Inventory, and the IPPC's 2006 Guide for National GHG Inventories. It comprehensively covers all major emission sources within the administrative boundaries of Sofia, including households, industry, transport, trade, services, and municipal buildings.

Compared to the recommendations set forth in the Cities Mission's Info Kit for Cities, the baseline inventory of Sofia Municipality is also not fully consistent in view of the types of GHG considered. However, following the requirements of the GCoM for reporting GHG inventories every four years, a new comprehensive inventory of GHG emissions will be made in 2025-2026 for the year 2024 and reported accordingly to the GCoM. This inventory will comply with all the requirements published as of the date of its production, including all scopes as per the Global Protocol and all gases as per the Kyoto Protocol

The baseline greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory for the municipality of Sofia plays a central role in designing impact pathways and climate actions for the city. This inventory provides a detailed view of the main sources of emissions within Sofia's administrative boundaries and serves as a basis for targeting sectors where emission reductions are necessary.

The results show that the buildings, especially residential buildings, industry and road transport sectors are the primary contributors to GHG emissions. However, the data for the industry were not sufficient and results had been calculated based on interpolation vs national data that lead to a distortion in the outcomes since industry in the economy of Sofia has a very small share, comprises only few industrial entities in the field of food and medicine production and only one bigger industrial producer of products from non-ferrous metals, so it is unlikely for the industrial sector to produce such a big share of GHG emissions in Sofia. Therefore this sector will be examined in detail in the comprehensive inventory to be produced for year 2024 as mentioned above and will not be taken into account in current portfolio. Currently, only the sector of buildings, transport and waste will be considered to addressing the emissions gap. These three sectors will be at the heart of future climate actions, with efforts focused on improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy, modernizing public transport and its infrastructure, and fostering the separation of waste at source and its recycling or utilization.

In terms of perspectives, the inventory highlights the importance of implementing more efficient data collection and management systems. A more robust and centralized data management approach will be searched to allow for better tracking of progress, refining emission mitigation strategies, and ensuring that reduction efforts are properly targeted and measured. Strengthening local capacities in data collection and analysis, developing digital tools, and more integrated monitoring platforms will be essential and will be a step to on the pathway to becoming a smart city.

These perspectives also include enhanced cooperation between various local actors, both public and private, to improve data access and ensure regular and accurate updates of the inventory. This will enable the city of Sofia to more effectively track its progress towards carbon neutrality and adjust its actions in real-time to maximize their impact.

Sofia's baseline GHG inventory is not only a diagnostic tool but also a lever for developing targeted and effective climate actions while paving the way for better data management to support these efforts in the long term.

The baseline greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory for the city of Sofia plays a crucial role in guiding the key strategic priorities outlined in our 2030 climate neutrality commitments. This inventory allows us to identify the sectors most responsible for emissions, such as households, transportation, waste, and municipal buildings. Based on this data, we can target specific actions within each sector to ensure significant emission reductions.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

#

The baseline inventory also serves as a starting point for measuring our progress over time, enabling us to adjust our strategies based on the results achieved and ensuring that we remain on track to meet our 2030 goals.

The baseline inventory is also a valuable tool for engaging stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, and local institutions, around our climate initiatives. By providing concrete and transparent data, we facilitate communication about the required efforts and the expected benefits of our emission reduction actions.

In addition, this inventory guides the development of our local policies and regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions. By basing our decisions on solid data, we ensure that the measures taken are both accepted and effective. The inventory also allows us to adapt our strategic priorities to the local realities, taking into account Sofia's unique challenges and specificities while aligning these priorities with our global climate commitments.

Thus, Sofia's baseline GHG inventory forms the cornerstone of our climate neutrality strategies for 2030, providing us with the necessary data to guide our actions, track our progress, and mobilize the entire community towards a more sustainable future.

# 2.1.1 Scope and limits of the inventory

# 2.1.1.1 Emission sources covered

The inventory covers GHG emissions within the administrative boundaries of the municipality of Sofia. This means that only the emissions generated by activities occurring within this geographical area are accounted for.

Sofia city flow mapping: Perimeter

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Sofia's inventory covers several categories of emission sources, each with its own characteristics and emission factors:
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

Stationary sources :
Residential and commercial buildings: Emissions from these sources come mainly from energy consumption for heating, cooling, lighting and the use of household appliances.
Municipal buildings: This includes schools, libraries, community centers and other public infrastructure. Emissions are calculated from recorded energy consumption, with a particular effort to extrapolate data where direct access is limited.
Industrial facilities: Includes emissions from manufacturing processes, construction activities and industrial facilities, which are determined by the consumption of fossil fuels and other energy sources.
Municipal lighting

Mobile sources :
Private and commercial vehicles: Includes all cars, motorbikes, light and heavy trucks operating within the city limits. Emissions are calculated on the basis of mileage and fuel consumption data, with adjustments for vehicle age and emission standards.
Municipal fleet: Includes vehicles owned by the municipality, including service and emergency vehicles. Fuel consumption is accurately recorded using internal distribution systems.
Public transport: Includes buses, trolleybuses, trams and underground trains. Energy consumption data is collected directly from transport operators.

Indirect emissions :
Electricity and heat consumption: Includes emissions associated with the use of electricity and heat, regardless of where they are produced. Emission factors are adjusted according to the energy mix specific to local and national production

Other direct sources :
Waste management: Emissions from the treatment and incineration of solid waste. Although precise data on the characteristics of refuse derived fuels (RDF) is limited, average emission factors are applied.
Gas distribution: Accidental emissions resulting from natural gas leaks in the distribution network are also included.
Agriculture

## 2.1.1.2 Direct and indirect emissions

As part of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory for the city of Sofia, we applied two reference protocols: the GHG Protocol and the Covenant of Mayors. These two methodologies, widely recognized and adopted internationally, provide similar frameworks for evaluating GHG emissions. One of the common features of these two approaches is the clear distinction between two types of emissions: direct emissions and indirect emissions.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

# 1. Direct emissions (Stationary Sources)

Direct emissions, also known as stationary source emissions, are those that come directly from the combustion of fossil fuels within the geographical limits of the city. These emissions are generated by activities that take place within the city and involve the use of fuels to produce energy or for industrial processes. In Sofia's inventory, this includes:

Building heating: Emissions resulting from the combustion of natural gas, fuel oil, or coal to heat residences, offices, commercial spaces, and municipal installations.
Industrial and construction activities: Emissions generated by industrial processes or construction that require the combustion of fuels.
Local heat production: When heat is produced within the city, for example, in local thermal power plants, the associated emissions are considered direct.
Transportation: Emissions generated by private, commercial, and municipal vehicles that consume fossil fuels (gasoline, diesel, natural gas) within the city. This includes personal cars, trucks, municipal buses, and other motorized transport used daily in the city.
RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) waste incineration: When waste is converted into derived fuels for incineration, the emissions produced by this incineration, if it takes place within the city limits, are considered direct emissions.

These emissions are accounted for directly in the city's inventory as they are generated by activities that physically take place within the territory of Sofia. In the table, direct emissions are presented under Scope 1, while indirect emissions are shown under Scope 2, as follows:

|   | Group Holes |   |   |   |   |   |   | Total |   | Elevated Average |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

|  Sofia | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | Total | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |   |

# 2. Indirect emissions

Indirect emissions, on the other hand, come from energy consumption within the city, but where the production of this energy occurs outside its geographical limits. This type of emissions mainly includes those associated with the use of electricity and heat. For Sofia, these indirect emissions are calculated based on energy consumption by the city's various sectors, taking into account specific emission factors for electricity and heat produced elsewhere.

Indirect emissions include:

Electricity consumed in buildings: Electricity used by households, offices, commercial spaces, and public services. Although this electricity is consumed within the city, the emissions associated with its production may have occurred in power plants located outside Sofia, often using fossil fuels.
Heat supplied by district heating networks: When heat is produced outside the city, for example, in a thermal power plant, but used for heating within the city, the emissions related to this heat production are considered indirect.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

In Sofia's inventory, these indirect emissions are carefully accounted for to reflect the total impact of the city's energy consumption, even when the emissions do not occur directly within its borders.

## 2.1.1.3 Data collection

The first step involved gathering accurate data on electricity and heat consumption across all sectors of the city. This includes:

Residential: Electricity and heat consumption in households.
Commercial and services: Consumption in offices, shops, hospitals, schools, etc.
Industrial: Consumption in factories and production facilities.
Municipal: Consumption in public buildings and infrastructure, such as schools, administrative offices, street lighting, etc.

For the specific case of Sofia, the following sectors were considered:

Households: Includes electricity and heat consumption for heating, air conditioning, hot water, and household appliances in the city's homes.
Trade and services: Includes consumption in offices, shops, banks, SMEs, hospitals, and other private sector buildings.
Municipal buildings: Electricity and heat consumption in buildings managed or owned by the municipality, such as administrative offices, schools, libraries, community centers, etc.
Industry and construction: Includes energy consumption in factories, production facilities, and construction sites in the city.
Agriculture and forestry: Energy consumption for local agricultural activities, including the use of agricultural machinery and greenhouse heating.
Private and commercial vehicles: Electricity consumption (for electric vehicles) and fuel consumption for private and commercial vehicles operating in the city.
Municipal fleet: Energy consumption for vehicles owned by the municipality and used by municipal employees.
Public transport: Includes electricity consumption for electric buses, trams, trolleybuses, and urban trains, as well as the use of fossil fuels for other public transport means.
Public lighting and traffic lights: Electricity consumption for street lighting, public spaces, and traffic lights.
Accidental emissions: Gas leaks during distribution in the urban network.
Waste: Energy consumption for waste treatment, including the incineration of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) outside the city limits.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

## 2.1.2 Uncertainty and precision

The global uncertainty of Sofia's greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory is a composite of two primary sources of uncertainty.

The first component stems from the emission factor, which typically carries an uncertainty level of 1 to 2 percent. This relatively low uncertainty is due to the well-established scientific methods used to determine emission factors.

The second component, however, introduces a more variable level of uncertainty and is linked to the process of data gathering. This aspect of uncertainty is highly dependent on the specific emission source being measured and the capabilities and methods employed in collecting the relevant data.

The detailed inventory data are presented in the following tables.

## A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies – textual element

## Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 2021-2030 (SECAP2021-2030).

The SECAP 2021-2030 is the major document in view of climate change mitigation and adaptation. This is an integrated horizontal document including also the Long-term Energy Efficiency Program and Long-term program to promote the use of energy from renewable sources and biofuels. It has been adopted in 2021, with Decision No. 812/16.12.2021 of the Sofia City Council (SCC).

The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan of the Sofia Municipality 2021-2030 (SECAP) has been developed in accordance with the obligations of the Sofia Municipality arising not only from the Global Agreement of Mayors on Climate and Energy, but also from national legislation, being the leading energy and climate strategy document. The SECAP builds on the actions of Sofia Municipality in the field of sustainable energy development and offers a new integrated approach to planning and reporting activities in the field of energy and climate, harmonizing the existing policies of the municipality in terms of mitigation and adaptation to climate change, increasing energy efficiency and the use of energy from renewable sources. It sets the framework for achieving the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40,6% by 2030, while following the EU's guiding principle "Energy Efficiency First".

The SECAP covers a 10-year period of action, from 2021 to 2030 inclusive and the entire territory of the Sofia Municipality. The plan envisages a total of 65 measures to be implemented in the period 2021-2030, of which 29 on mitigation of climate change and 36 on adaptation to climate change. The planned measures enable the municipality to speed up a number of reforms related to the building stock, public lighting systems, transport, the environment and other areas.

important documents have been annexed to the SECAP, as follows:

Annex 1: 2018 GHG emissions inventory
Annex 2: SWOT analysis regarding the sectors included in the scope of the baseline inventory
Annex 3: Summary of climate change mitigation measures
Annex 4: Summary of climate change adaptation measures and sample scopes of measures

SECAP provides for the achievement of three major strategic goals:

Sofia – a climate neutral city

Turning Sofia into a carbon-neutral city by 2050 by implementing the highest standards in terms of energy efficiency and transforming the energy mix towards the use of energy from RES with an emphasis on shared energy production and consumption at local level.

Sofia – a resource-efficient city

Development of Sofia according to the principles of circular economy with an emphasis on the protection of the environment and biodiversity and the creation of comfortable and healthy conditions for the life and professional realization of citizens.

Sofia – an adaptive city

Increasing the adaptation capacity of the Sofia Municipality to deal with the negative impacts caused by climate change by developing the regulatory framework and institutional capacity, attracting the attention of the public and business, implementing environmentally friendly solutions for adaptation and increasing the possibilities for prevention and improving preparedness and the response to the occurrence of extreme climatic events.

With a view to achieving the strategic goals thus set, the implementation of a set of measures is envisaged in the sectors of residential buildings, buildings from the tertiary sector, municipal buildings, public transport and mobility, waste, public lighting, and industry and construction.

The SECAP covers both mitigation and adaptation to climate change.

With regard to mitigation, 29 mitigation measures are planned in the SECAP, divided into the following groups:

Legal-administrative and management framework for climate policy - measures related to legislative initiative and development of regulatory documents, including internal rules and municipal regulations;
Improving the management of climate change mitigation activities - measures related to improving the information base for the implementation of plans, programs and projects;
Investment measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or increase the share of energy use from renewable sources - investment measures to intervene in the physical environment (urban and non-urban);
Building a system for broad public involvement in the implementation of the measures - measures related to communication with the interested parties, providing information, engaging the representatives of the individual sectors to implement activities in support of the implementation of the goals of the plan.

The expected results of the implementation of the measures are:

Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 40,6% by 2030 compared to 2007 levels;
Increasing energy efficiency and the use of energy from RES in individual sectors;
Implementation of a fully functional system for information assurance for the purposes of reporting climate change mitigation measures and future planning;
Ensuring broad public support in climate change mitigation policies, with the aim of building a positive attitude towards the implemented policies of more than half of the population in the capital.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

In terms of adaptation to climate change, the measures are mainly aimed at reducing vulnerability in individual sectors and limiting damage from negative climate events like the Urban Heat Island. A total of 36 measures are foreseen, divided into the following groups:

Legal-administrative and management framework for climate policy - measures related to legislative initiative and development of normative documents;
Upgrading the institutional, expert and financial capacity and the planning basis for the implementation of the measures - measures related to the creation of structural units, development of planning documents, management of activities;
Applied urban research and development activities - measures related to conducting specialized research, cooperation and interactions, implementation of pilot projects;
Investments in technical and green infrastructure, buildings and improvements - investment measures for intervention in the physical environment (urban and non-urban);
Building a system for broad public involvement in the implementation of measures - measures related to communication with interested parties, providing information, upgrading education programs and developing and conducting thematic training.

Expected results when implementing the measures include:

Necessary regulatory documents developed, additional dedicated structures created and specialized sector plans developed;
A dedicated information system developed to provide data for sectoral analyzes related to the impact of climate and for assessment and monitoring of indicators;
Improved assessments of impact indicators for high climate risks in each sector.

Given the new and constantly changing trends, policies and goals in the field of climate, not only at national, but also at European and global level, the periodic revision and updating of the long-term strategic documents of the Sofia Municipality, including the SECAP, is foreseen. Currently a public procurement is on-going for update and upgrade of the SECAP in view of the new targets and for including the analysis and strategy for tackling the energy poverty.

## Green City Action Plan 2020-2030 (GCAP)

The GCAP was adopted by Decision No. 249 of June 25, 2020 of the Metropolitan Municipal Council. The plan was prepared with the support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), using the Green Cities Planning Methodology developed by the EBRD, together with expert support from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Cities Network for Sustainable Urban development. The document was developed in accordance with international agreements and conventions, such as the Paris Agreement, as well as with the relevant strategic documents at the national, regional and municipal level available at the time of its drafting.

The aspiration of the GCAP is to transform Sofia Municipality into a green, vibrant municipality with a clean environment and sustainable use of natural resources. To achieve this vision, an analysis was carried out based on data collected according to the EBRD methodology, taking into account the specific geographical location of the city and the settlements around it, and the environmental challenges facing the municipality were ranged by priority.

The GCAP sets out three main strategic goals aimed at improving:

The urban environment and preservation of biological diversity and ecosystems by improving and expanding green spaces, integrating green infrastructure and promoting transit-oriented development of the city.
Ambient air quality and reducing the carbon footprint by increasing the share of public transport, promoting the use of environmentally friendly vehicles, increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and increasing the share of energy from renewable sources in the heating of buildings.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

The use of natural resources to achieve resilience to climate change by optimizing surface water management and recycling and reducing the amount of landfilled waste.

The objectives are in line with the criterion of excellence in relation to the EBRD methodology and are aligned with the objectives of the European Union. At the same time, each goal is related to the existing national goals and programs and contributes to a significant improvement of the state of the environment.

For the achievement of the goals set forth seventeen short-term key measures are foreseen in the following priority sectors: energy, urban planning, building stock and communities, green-blue infrastructure and transport and mobility.

To deal with the identified challenges in each of the priority sector, the GCAP has developed basic measures to improve the environment and the quality of life in the municipality. The measures are complementary and accompanied by a series of supporting activities.

The GCAP specifies the priority and sequence in the implementation of the measures, includes a financial analysis, a financing mechanism, as well as an assessment of the benefits of their implementation.

Measures in the main sectors include:

Energy Sector - upgrade of the existing programs for energy efficiency in municipal buildings; renovation of public lighting; use of natural geothermal energy on the territory of Sofia Municipality as an alternative source of heat energy in buildings.
Urban Planning Sector - transit-oriented transport; restoration of abandoned industrial zones and terrains.
Building stock and communities Sector - improvement of inter-block residential spaces; construction of micro-parks in densely populated residential districts; energy efficiency of multi-family residential buildings; building centers for repair and reuse of items.
Blue-green infrastructure - assessment of the risk of expected climate changes and reduction of the danger of floods; surface water management; protection, improvement and expansion of green corridors; optimizing the recycling and management of construction waste.
Transport &amp; Mobility – promoting cycling and walking; encouraging the use of electric vehicles; modernization of trams; city parking management.

The GCAP provides a complex system for reporting, control and evaluation of the implementation of the measures and the effect of their implementation. The document contains guidelines for engaging key stakeholders and the public.

The monitoring of the implementation of the GCAP is carried out at two levels:

Monitoring of the implementation of the GCAP - implemented by a coordination unit specially created for the purpose, which monitors the implementation of the measures by the relevant responsible directorates in the structure of the Sofia Municipality.
Impact monitoring - the effect of the implementation of the GCAP is reported annually by the respective responsible directorates.

As a result of this activity, an assessment of the expected and achieved results is carried out and an analysis of the progress achieved in the implementation of the goals set in the GCAP is carried out.

The GCAP is in full consistency with all European and global goals in view of tackling the challenges of the climate change effects. It is not replaced but rather complemented and developed further by the SECAP. It has been taken into consideration in the preparation of the SECAP in order to avoid double counting of measures and their effect.

# Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan 2019-2035 (SUMP)

The SUMP is the first integrated mobility planning document of Sofia Municipality in line with sustainable decarburization policies and puts the municipality in a strong position to promote active public transport and implement better management approaches to reduce vehicle traffic and mitigating its negative impact.

The plan is a strategic document designed to meet the mobility needs of people and businesses in the city and its surroundings, for a better quality of life. It responds to new challenges by proposing an integrated vision and policies for all modes of transport and planning a transport system for people that is socially, environmentally and economically sustainable. This is primarily achieved by adopting
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

a holistic approach to the relationship between urban planning and sustainable mobility. The plan is an important key in the process of creating a well-connected sustainable Sofia city that provides a better quality of life for more residents and visitors. The plan is based on the principles of sustainability and takes into account the best international transport practices and future trends in mobility in view of achieving better sustainability.

The SUMP is prepared in parallel and in coordination with other strategic documents and programs concerning the long-term development of the Sofia Municipality, including:

"Vision for Sofia" – a comprehensive sustainable urban development strategy for Sofia and its suburban territories with a horizon of 2050;
"Green Sofia" - an initiative that aims to encourage local authorities in their efforts to reduce the negative impact of the urban environment on the health of residents and to apply high environmental standards in their management;
"Sofia - a city for people" - a project focused on developing public spaces for pedestrians and cyclists, limiting car traffic and turning Sofia into a city on a human scale.

The objectives of the SUMP are aimed to:

reducing traffic and, accordingly, reducing the time spent in traffic and travel;
convenient, fast and safe movement,
reduction of air pollution and noise pollution, etc.

The GCAP indicates a number of benefits from its implementation, including travel time savings, OPEX savings; improvement of human health, increased physical activity, etc.

The SUMP contains:

A Sustainable urban mobility Vision of Sofia 2035, according to which Sofia will develop sustainable urban mobility by:
Protecting the environment and human health
Focusing on people, not vehicles
Becoming effective and innovative
Becoming safe and secure
Becoming integrated and accessible to all.

The sustainable urban mobility vision of Sofia gives the direction in which the transport system of the city should develop. To achieve the vision, SUMP defines five general goals, each corresponding to one of the elements of the vision:

Green City: Reducing the negative impact of transport on people's health and the environment;
Attractive city: Increasing the attractiveness of the urban environment and ensuring a better quality of life;
Smart City: Introducing transport innovations and strengthening local mobility and economy;
Safe City: Improving the safety and security of all actors;
Accessible city: An integrated and accessible transport system for all.

A concept for the development of urban mobility, which covers all the main areas of the capital city transport system - road traffic and street network, parking, logistics, public transport, bicycle and pedestrian traffic.

In support of this sustainable urban mobility concept, the plan includes a series of specific policies and measures to be implemented to achieve the goals.

The main goal of the SUMP is to achieve a lasting change in the behavior of travelers and a transition to sustainable forms of transport.

It includes two types of measures:

Pull measures: Promotional measures aimed at attracting and stimulating more people to use sustainable forms of transport such as walking, cycling, public transport, shared mobility.
Push measures: Restrictive measures aimed at reducing the number of people using private cars, parking restrictions, limiting certain types of freight transport in certain parts of the city, etc.

In turn, these two types of measures are divided into the following groups:

Regulatory/economic measures - limiting car traffic and stimulating public transport
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

✓ Physical/Technical measures - limiting car traffic and stimulating public transport, improving cycling infrastructure
✓ Planning and urban design - urban planning limiting car dependence and urban design oriented towards pedestrians and cyclists;
✓ Complementary measures - increased control and greater public awareness. In turn, these two types of measures can be divided into the following groups:

The SUMP also offers a set of projects and initiatives that will contribute to the fulfillment of the vision and achievement of the goals of the SUMP for turning Sofia into a green, attractive, smart, safe and accessible city. The projects are grouped by specific goals in each direction:

Pedestrian traffic - improving the conditions, comfort and safety of pedestrian movement by increasing the pedestrian network in the central city part, creating pedestrian connectivity in and between residential districts, city parks and work zones, ensuring pedestrian safety, increasing the quality of the urban environment, promotion of pedestrian traffic.
Bicycle traffic – together with pedestrian traffic, it is ecological, healthy and contributes to the vitality of the city. The development of bicycle traffic is largely determined by providing a network of comfortable, safe and interconnected routes in a network that will allow comfortable and safe bicycle movement throughout the city.
Public transport and intermodality – this includes the expansion of the metro, development of the ground transport system and reduction of travel time, increase in comfort and quality of travel by public transport; introduction of integrated travel billing, etc.
Parking - since it is a problem not only in the central city, the main specific goals in this direction are to stimulate parking in underground and multi-story parking lots, as well as the expansion of the system of buffer parking around metro stations and the central city; improving parking management and regulation; implementing a flexible pricing policy for parking regulation.
Electromobility - in the short term, the efforts of Sofia Municipality should be aimed at expanding the charging infrastructure in public municipal property and placing fast charging stations, as well as promoting and stimulating the entry and use of electric vehicles;
Urban logistics - its improvement can be achieved through quality planning, provision of appropriate infrastructure, good administrative regulation, etc.
Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) - in the short term, Sofia Municipality should implement a wide range of ITS systems and create an institutional and operational model to achieve a greater degree of integration of data, systems and service. In this way, the city will achieve a complete and unified management in terms of transport and will allow the implementation of the planned projects in the long term.

In order to achieve a more accurate traceability of the effects of the implementation of the selected measures, specific measurable indicators have been defined to be monitored over time, like:

Output indicators - determine what the final result of the implementation of a specific project activity is. They are measured by physical units of measurement (for example: number of new vehicles serving public transport, km of built/rehabilitated tram network).
Result indicators - related to the direct immediate effect (physical or financial) in favor of the population as a result of the implementation of a given project. For example, if the specific objective is to develop the surface transport system and reduce travel time, a performance indicator is "length of tram network built" and an outcome indicator is "population served by the newly built tram network".
Impact indicators – refer to the consequences of project implementation beyond immediate effects/results. Two types of impact are distinguished: specific impact - these are effects that occur after a certain period of time, which are directly related to the action taken and the directly affected population, and global impact - takes into account the long-term effects affecting a wide range of the population.

# Waste Management Program 2021 – 2028 (WMP)

The Waste Management Program of Sofia Municipality for the period 2021-2028 was developed in accordance with the structure, goals and predictions of the National Waste Management Plan 2021-2028 and is an integral part of the Environmental Protection Program.

The main purpose of the WMP is to provide a practical tool for Sofia Municipality for planning at the earliest stage of the necessary resources, measures and actions for waste management for the population and business, including improving waste management system in compliance with the pan-European waste management policy.

The municipal program is an open document that can be supplemented and updated periodically in the event of changes in the context and/or regulatory conditions, in the event of changes to the goals and priorities of the national and/or European legislation, which enables timely and adequate actions to be taken in the implementation of the policy related to waste management.

The structure and objectives of the program have been developed in accordance with the Methodological guidelines for the development of regional/municipal programs for waste management, as well as the applicable municipal regulations at the local level.

The main task of the Program is to contribute to the sustainable development of the Municipality of Sofia, through the implementation of an integrated waste management system, which will lead to:

a reduction of environmental impacts caused by generated waste,
an increase in the share of separately collected waste, as well as
stimulating investments to improve waste management.

The program was prepared on the basis of available data on waste in the municipality, results of conducted studies on waste management systems, as well as on the grounds of the analysis of the possibilities for financing activities related to waste.

The program includes expert proposals and forecasts for the period 2021-2028 for the development of waste management infrastructure and practices, including:

demographic forecast;
forecast for generated waste;
an estimate of the types of waste that can be prevented;
forecast of the types of waste that can undergo preparation for reuse.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

The main objective of the program is the population and the to improve the implementation of the waste management hierarchy in all processes and levels.

The strategic goals set in the program are:

Reducing the harmful impact of waste by preventing its formation and promoting its reuse;
Increasing the amount of recycled and recovered waste;
Reduction of the quantities and the risk of landfilled household waste.

The municipal waste management program of Sofia Municipality contains programs and sub-programs with specific measures addressed to each one of them, including:

Waste prevention program, including a food waste prevention sub-program;
Program to reach the goals for preparing for reuse and for recycling of household waste;
Program for achieving the goals for recycling and recovery of construction waste and building demolition waste;
Program for achieving the goals for recycling and utilization of MRO, incl. packaging and packaging waste management subprogram;
Program to reduce the quantities and the risk of landfilled household waste.

The sub-programs represent a specific plan of action where some of the measures have horizontal character, that is, they contribute to the achievement not only of the objectives of the specific program, but also to the achievement of the objectives of other programs and sub-program. Some of the measures are soft measures including a diverse palette of activities like trainings, information and awareness raising campaigns, development and implementation of information systems, etc.

The program also includes the necessary measures to fulfil the duties of the mayor of the municipality in compliance with effective legislation. The relevant administrative, technical and financial measures have been implemented to ensure the practical implementation of the Program and exercise control and monitoring activities of its practical implementation.

The monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Waste Management Program of the Sofia Municipality is of a key importance for tracking progress in achieving the set goals, deadlines and resources and taking timely actions to overcome emerging problems during the implementation of the actions, and if necessary - undertaking actions for improvement of the program. The monitoring is carried out through periodic collection of information related to the implementation of the measures included in the Program and the degree of achievement of the indicators, as well as analysis of the collected information, problems encountered during implementation and their causes. In addition, compliance with the planned schedule and the degree of resource utilization are also monitored for each measure. The activities of implementation of municipal plans and strategies in the field of environment and waste management are carried out by a unit appointed by the Mayor of Sofia Municipality.

The authority for control over the implementation of the Waste Management Program is the Sofia City Council. The mayor of the municipality annually informs the municipal council and the public about the implementation of the program for the previous calendar year. For this purpose, he prepares a report on the implementation of the Waste Management Program. The purpose of the report on the implementation of the Program during the previous calendar year is to track the progress of the actions and to identify the necessary amendments or its adaptation for the current year.

The WMP fully comply with the principles of Circular Economy founded in the European policy documents and is conformable to the objectives and targets of the Mission Cities.

# Integrated Ambient Air Quality Improvement Program of the Sofia Municipality for the period 2021-2026 (IAAQIP)

Improving the quality of ambient air (AQ) and reaching and maintaining the national and European environmental standards for air cleanliness is among the most important priorities of the Sofia Municipality and aims to improve the quality of life of citizens and the state of the environment. In this regard, the municipality has adopted and is implementing an Integrated Ambient Air Quality Improvement Program of the Sofia Municipality for the period 2021-2026.

The requirements and competences of the local authorities, regulated in the Clean Air Act and the regulations adopted on its basis, have been taken into account when developing the Program for Air Pollution Control. A large volume of information has been collected, systematized and analyzed:
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

reports, documents, information arrays with data and good practices in the field under consideration have been studied. The current program is in line with the National Program for Improving Air Quality (2018-2024) and the National Program for Air Pollution Control (2020-2030), adopted by the Council of Ministers in 2019.

IAAQIP contains general information about the area - geographical, administrative, etc. It takes into account the population exposed to pollution, as well as the influence of socio-economic and natural-geographical characteristics. Also the urbanization of the Sofia Municipality and the impact on the quality of the ambient air.

The actions included in the IAAQIP are aimed at reducing the levels of pollutants for which excessive pollution has been established like PM10, PM2.5 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and reaching the established thresholds for these indicators as both the monitoring points of ambient air quality and the areas with excessive pollution established during modeling.

The program contains various measures divided into the following groups:

Technical measures

The main types of measures of this program are addressing the following sectors:

domestic heating;
transport &amp; mobility;
construction;
industry;
emissions from re-suspension of particles from surface sources.

Measures in the domestic heating sector (replacing wood and coal stoves with environmentally friendly alternatives, fitting filters to wood and coal heated homes, using dry wood for heating by households) are a strategic priority for the city due to their predominant contribution to air pollution and ability to reduce harmful emissions. With these measures, as far as possible, the fastest step-by-step reduction of emissions of PM10, PM2.5 and PAH can be achieved.

The main measures included, in combination with the additional and long-term actions are expected to lead to an estimated reduction in domestic heating emissions as follows:

20% reduction in emissions compared to the base year by 2022;
40% reduction in emissions compared to the base year by 2024;
70% reduction in emissions compared to the base year by 2026.

These targets are in full compliance with the strategic goals of the city and also contribute to the achievement of commitments made to the Mission.

Measures to reduce emissions in resuspension of particles from surface sources

Surface sources (eg, landfills, "mud patches", streets and sidewalks, etc.) are the second most important source contributors to concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5, mostly through wind resuspension and secondary entrainment from motor vehicles. At the same time, these sources are of particular importance for the quality of the environment at the local (neighborhood) level and must be taken into account. A priority among this group of measures is the implementation in all 24 districts of the Sofia Municipality of the measures to remove the "mud spots" in inter-block and other open public spaces, the control to prevent parking in green areas (which is prohibited and turns green areas into "mud spots"), etc.

Measures in the motor transport sector

The main measures included, in combination with additional and long-term actions, are expected to lead to an estimated reduction in emissions from vehicles as follows:

10% reduction in vehicle emissions compared to the base year by 2022;
20% reduction in vehicle emissions compared to the base year by 2024;
30% reduction in vehicle emissions compared to the base year by 2026.

The emission reduction is expected to be achieved as a result of three main groups of measures:

Reduction of the average annual mileage and the forced stay of motor vehicles on the streets of Sofia - includes development, optimization, greening, integration and increasing the attractiveness of public urban transport. Through this measure, an
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

O

increase in public transport trips is expected at the expense of car trips and a reduction in traffic;

Increasing the ecological class of the motor vehicle and the compliance of its emissions;
Improving the condition of the road surface.

## Measures in the industry sector

The measures in this sector are aimed at industrial and energy facilities, which are a source of emissions of PM - 1% of the total emissions of PM10 and 2% of PM2.5, but are the source of about 15% of N₂O emissions.

The role of the Sofia Municipality to influence this sector is limited, as the industrial sector is controlled by the Regional Inspectorate of Environment and Water. The Sofia Municipality will continue to implement control of the technological process in the municipal enterprises and commercial companies that operate the sites, sources of emissions in the ambient air, such as municipal installations and waste dumps and sites of the municipal heating system.

## Measures in the construction and repair sector

Construction and repair activities in construction are a source of emissions of FPC10, and the relative share in the total emissions of this pollutant is insignificant - 1%. Construction sites, however, can be a serious source of local dusting in the neighborhoods and deterioration of the aesthetic elements of the neighborhood urban environment, especially in case of non-compliance with the requirements of the municipal ordinance to prevent pollution and dusting from the sector.

## Information measures

These measures are aimed at improving and increasing people's knowledge and awareness of the quality of ambient air and the harm of polluted air on human health and the consequences for the environment, as well as campaigns on the important role and possible ways citizens with their daily behavior and habits to contribute to cleaner air in the municipality.

## Control measures - implementation of control over emission sources.

## Organizational measures, such as design and development of municipal information systems, registers, etc. to inform the process of tracking trends in the field under consideration, creating and improving cooperation with other organizations, etc.

The timeline for applying the measures is:

short-term plan – 2021-2022
medium-term plan – 2023-2024
long-term plan – 2025-2026

The main strategic goal of the program is to reach the European standards for ambient air quality as an important factor in ensuring a healthy environment for the population.

A strategic priority for reaching the goals of the program are measures in the domestic heating sector. To achieve the goal of the program, a detailed Action Plan has been developed. The purpose of the Action Plan is to facilitate the process of monitoring the progress, control and reporting on the implementation of the program. It has been developed according to sub-programs, which specify and address the measures identified as the most suitable for reaching the AQ, corresponding to the regulatory requirements.

The action plan includes the list of the measures and the deadlines for their achievement; the estimated funds needed to secure the measures and the possible sources of funding; the organizations and structures of the Sofia Municipality, which are leading and supporting units of the Sofia Municipality for the implementation of the measures.

The Municipality of Sofia monitors and evaluates the implementation of the Program in order to track the progress of the implementation of the measures and take appropriate actions in a timely manner in case of identified bottlenecks.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia City

The monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the IAAQP is carried out through annual collection of information on the degree of achievement of the indicators of progress/implementation of the measures of the Action Plan, as well as analysis and identification of problems arising during the implementation and their causes. The report also contains summary information and analysis on the quality of the ambient air for the last year and the trends for the last three years based on the data from the monitoring of the AQ. In addition, for each measure, compliance with the planned schedule is monitored and the extent of resource consumption is reported.

The coordination for tracking progress and for preparing the annual reports on the implementation of the program to the SCC is carried out by the Climate, Energy and Ambient Air Directorate.

The program will be updated in case of changes in the legislation that require significant amendments in the program and in the planned measures to achieve its goals. The program can also be updated if changes/additional measures are necessary due to a significant delay in the implementation and achievement of the target indicators, as well as in other unforeseen circumstances.

# Vision for Sofia. Long-term strategy for sustainable development of Sofia and the suburban areas until 2050.

The Vision for Sofia is an initiative of the Sofia Municipality to create a shared and long-term strategy for the development of the city of Sofia and the suburban territories until 2050. The idea for its creation started in 2016 in the discussions led by the informal Laboratory for Urban Development, which brings together architects, urban planners and experts from various sectors to discuss the necessary changes and reforms in Sofia's town planning and planning. During these meetings, it became clear the need for a long-term strategy for the development of the municipality, which would serve for the informed and responsible amendment of the General Development Plan of Sofia.

The strategy paper was developed by a multi-disciplinary team of specialists who have different backgrounds from the business, the non-governmental sector and academia in the fields of the urban environment, transport, environment, economy and governance, identity, culture and people.

The purpose of the document is to create a platform for an informed conversation about the future of the city, which includes at the beginning of the decision-making process all citizens and the organizations that determine the development of the capital (municipal authorities, non-governmental sector, investors, entrepreneurs, researchers, experts).

The strategic document Vision for Sofia contains several main elements:

Five priorities, which unite the most significant and important goals in the long-term development of the city of Sofia and the suburban territories;
24 long-term strategic goals that work for the implementation of the five priorities and are related to the long-term development of the municipality in the seven directions of the Vision: Urban Environment, Environment, Transport, Economy, Identity and Culture, Management and People;
230 key steps towards achieving the long-term goals, spread over time from 2020 to 2050;
385 specific measures to achieve the goals and steps;
Indicators with which to regularly measure and report progress on taking steps and achieving long-term goals.

The strategic goals laid down in the Vision for Sofia are the following:

Multi-functional city;
Quality urban environment;
Compact and concentrated city;
Sustainable and innovative tourism;
A highly productive economy;
Innovation Center;
Circular economy;
Rapprochement and community;
Future-oriented education;
Healthy life and healthy people;
Sustainable resource and energy balance;

Many of the proposed 385 concrete measures help to achieve more steps and goals. This is an example of the good communication and cooperation of the Sofia Municipality and various stakeholders for co-creation of a common vision for the sustainable development of the city.

A very important document for the climate-neutrality of Sofia city is the one introducing the Low Emission Zones for transport and heating.

# Ordinance on the introduction of low emission zones on the territory of Sofia Municipality

The Ordinance was adopted by the Metropolitan Municipal Council on 15.12.2022, it is in force as of 01.12.2023.

The purpose of adopting the ordinance is to reduce the sources of air pollution and harmful emissions and to improve the air quality and human health. It regulates the rules and conditions for the introduction of low emission zones on the territory of the Municipality and also introducing restrictions and prohibitions on the movement of motor vehicles of certain eco groups for a certain period of time, within the zones. It also regulates the introduction of restrictions and prohibitions on the use of solid fuels for domestic heating in a part of and subsequently in the entire territory of Sofia Municipality.

The legal act establishes two low-emission zones in the central part of Sofia, in which, for a certain period of time, a ban on the movement and passage of motor vehicles of categories M 1 and N 1 with low ecological groups (from the first to the third ecological group) is gradually introduced.

The restriction covers the period from December 1 of the relevant calendar year to the last day of February of the following calendar year, in which period the most serious exceedances of the norms of harmful substances and air polluter are registered.

The two zones are tentatively designated as "The Small Ring" and "The Big Ring" and cover the ideal and wider center of the city of Sofia, respectively.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

The impact of the ordinance for the climate-neutrality will be more or less an indirect one and will occur as a result of the changed behavior of the citizens for using public transport in the central part of the city, but also gradually start using public transport more than their private cars.

The above described documents are the major strategic and legal documents incorporating policies related to climate and environment. Sofia Municipality has a long list of strategic documents in various sectors of economic and social life and all of them are in full consistency with the European policies and goals.

All major strategic documents of the municipality are in perfect synergy to make Sofia a green, resilient, circular, climate-neutral and smart city.

With all strategic goals and policies and measures provided in the existing strategic documents Sofia has a good ground to commit to achieving at least  $81\%$  reduction of the GHG emissions as per baseline inventory. The existing strategic documents has provided for various measures in the major domains identified by the Mission which measures will achieve nearly a  $41\%$  reduction of the harmful emissions. So, the remaining gap to be addressed by implementing the measures included in the portfolios of this CCC document is about  $40\%$ . The rest share to completed neutrality

For the present action plan, the baseline taken as reference is the business-as-usual (BAU) at 2030, the worst scenario, while the emission reduction target is the total impact of the strategic pathways re-targeted with the support of the stakeholders.

The emissions gap calculated as per the BAU scenario via the Economic Model is presented in the below table.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

A-2.2: Emissions gap analysis

|  Transport | 873 | 849 | 97% | 434 | 50% | 415 | 48% | 415 | 48% | 24 | 3%  |
|  Electricity | 2348 | 1996 | 85% | 958 | 41% | 1038 | 44% | 1038 | 44% | 352 | 15%  |
|  Waste | 127 | 8 | 6% | 2 | 1% | 6 | 5% | 6 | 5% | 119 | 94%  |
|  Other (inlc. IPPU&AFOLU) | 453 | 362 | 80% | 161 | 36% | 201 | 44% | 201 | 44% | 91 | 20%  |
|  Total | 4349 | 3543 | 81% | 1765 | 41% | 1758 | 40% | 1758 | 40% | 806 | 19%  |

The estimated residual emissions amount to 19%. Currently, these estimations are based on the possible actions that could be implemented in the major domains. However, next iterations may provide for different conditions and this may lead to reduction of the residual emissions. Moreover, Sofia Municipality has a steadfast strategy for development and improvement of green areas and green infrastructure within the city. Currently about 52% of the territory of the city is green and the expanding of green carbon sinks may in a long-term perspective, up to 2050, be able to offset a considerable amount of the residual emission.

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

## A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

### 2.3.1 Description of Urban Systems, Systemic Barriers, and Opportunities for Sofia

The city of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, has committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2030 as part of the European Union's initiative to make 100 cities climate-neutral and smart. This initiative, supported by the Horizon Europe program, emphasizes innovation and collaboration to reach ambitious emission reduction targets. This commitment aligns perfectly with the strategies and policies of the city of Sofia.

### 2.3.1.1 Relevant Systems and Key Stakeholders

To achieve its climate neutrality goal, Sofia must examine and manage various interconnected systems:

**Technological and Infrastructural:** Sofia invests in green public transport infrastructure, such as trams and electric buses, and develops charging networks for electric vehicles. The city also modernizes its waste management systems and promotes energy efficiency in buildings through smart technologies. Currently, Sofia is working to improve its electric vehicle charging infrastructure and develop cleaner and more efficient public transport solutions, including the development of new metro lines. For example, Sofia has recently launched several pilot projects for installing electric vehicle charging stations in strategic areas of the city, aiming to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles among its citizens.

**Institutional and Regulatory:** Sofia is establishing robust legislative frameworks to support emission reductions, including regulations on building standards and policies promoting sustainable mobility. Collaboration with national and European authorities is essential to ensure policy coherence. The municipal government of Sofia works closely with the Ministry of Environment and Water to harmonize local regulations with European climate and energy directives.

**Organizational:** Coordination between different municipal agencies, public-private partnerships, and the involvement of academic institutions and NGOs is crucial. For instance, partnerships with universities for research on sustainable technologies can accelerate innovation. Effective and inclusive governance mobilizes all stakeholders and ensures coherent and integrated implementation of climate initiatives. Sofia has established a climate coordination committee comprising representatives from municipal agencies, local universities, and civil society organizations to oversee the implementation of climate policies and ensure the participation of all stakeholders.

**Financial:** Sofia will benefit from diversified financing mechanisms, including EU grants, green loans, and private investments. Access to additional funds through the Horizon Europe program will help finance pilot projects and innovative demonstrations. Financing mechanisms must be diversified and innovative to support green projects. Investments in sustainable infrastructure, subsidies, and green loans are essential to catalyze the energy transition.

**Political and Social:** Political commitment is vital to integrate climate goals into urban planning. Additionally, raising awareness and educating citizens, along with their active participation in local initiatives, will strengthen community support for climate policies. Strong political commitment to sustainability and the integration of climate goals into urban development plans are necessary to drive significant changes. Citizen participation is equally important: initiatives to raise awareness and educate citizens, as well as their active involvement in planning and implementing climate policies, create a

# 2.3.1.2 Barriers and Opportunities

Sofia faces several systemic barriers:

Barriers: Insufficient infrastructure for electric vehicles, underdeveloped cycling infrastructure, and energy-inefficient buildings are major obstacles. Additionally, there is a need for specialized skills and innovative financing mechanisms. Missing infrastructure, limited capacity in specialized skills, and gaps in coordination and monitoring processes are significant challenges. For instance, although Sofia has initiated projects to improve cycling infrastructure, its development remains limited and insufficient to meet the growing needs of urban cyclists.

Opportunities: Sofia plans to leverage its well-developed public transport networks and research centers to promote innovation. European funds for the energy transition and new energy storage technologies offer promising prospects. Leveraging European funds for the energy transition, adopting new energy storage technologies, and implementing national policies supporting renewable energy provide promising prospects. Integrating urban planning with climate goals and using urban data to optimize municipal services illustrate how existing processes can be strengthened. For example, Sofia collaborates with international partners to develop energy storage solutions and integrate smart energy management systems in public buildings.

# 2.3.1.3 Monitoring and Data Collection

To evaluate progress towards climate neutrality, Sofia intends to implement rigorous monitoring systems for greenhouse gas emissions, conduct regular energy audits, and monitor the impact of climate policies. Collecting relevant data, such as energy consumption, transport usage, and recycling rates, is essential. Analyzing this data through management software and predictive modelling will measure the effectiveness of actions and adjust strategies accordingly. Monitoring systems and relevant data collection are crucial for evaluating progress and adjusting strategies. Greenhouse gas emission monitoring systems, regular energy audits, and climate policy impact monitoring provide valuable indicators. Sofia currently uses smart sensor technologies to monitor air quality and pollution levels throughout the city, allowing for rapid response and real-time policy adjustments.

Sofia adopts a systemic and integrated approach to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, involving a diversity of stakeholders, resources, and strategies. While challenges are numerous, the opportunities for a sustainable and resilient transformation of the city are also significant. Coordinated efforts among public institutions, the private sector, civil society organizations, and citizens are essential to create a sustainable urban environment resilient to climate challenges.

|   |  Action description | Promoting cycling as a good alternative in urban environment is one of the strategies of Sofia Municipality to improve the quality of air, the health and life expectancy index of the population, including the reduction of carbon emissions. If more people have the opportunity and choose to cycle in the city, this would lead to significant benefits for society as a whole. Cycling can contribute to less congestion, cleaner air, an attractive and vibrant urban environment and, last but not least, a healthier lifestyle. One of the key factors that largely determines the choice to travel by bicycle is safety. Creating favourable conditions for cycling is related to creating a dense network of safe and interconnected cycling routes. At the moment, in Sofia there are approximately 350 km built and those in the process of planning and construction. However, the proportion of trips by bicycle is fairly low. This is because, on the one hand, the bicycle network in the city territory is not well connected and there are very few bicycle routes that are really  |

Efforts will focus on existing residential buildings, as new ones are with energy class 'A' or 'B'. The municipality's minimum goals are to support the renovation of 400 residential buildings. The strategy includes:
Further development of the existing Center for Energy Efficiency - Sofia and its transformation into a preferred place for information and assistance to the owners of residential properties for the implementation of energy efficiency measures. The center will develop an active information program to popularize financing opportunities among interested parties and for their technical support in the preparation of the project file;
Creation of a network of experts responsible for energy efficiency in regional administrations. The regional administration is closest to the citizens. The creation of a network of experts, their training, development and support will support the process of preparing project files;
Preparation of a projects pipeline - identification of potential residential buildings; helping owners' associations to prepare successful projects;
a. Identification of the potential of building roofs for the production of solar energy on the territory of the entire municipality. The data will be with open access with the aim of assisting residential buildings in identifying appropriate energy efficient measures;
Active engagement with stakeholders at the national level to secure appropriate funding opportunities. The Sofia Municipality can assist in designing workable financing requirement, proposing amendments in programing documents and regulatory framework, analyzing the EE measures implementation and giving valuable feedback to financing authorities.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

The residual emissions currently comes as a difference between the possible target to be achieved and the net-zero balance.

Total emissions that are not accounted for in this Action Plan: 804 889,64 tCO2e/a (19%)

The proposed interventions included in the Action Plan reflect the city's priority actions to achieving climate neutrality. These depends on the implementation capacity of the municipality and the focus is mainly on those interventions for which Sofia is directly accountable. However, we have a continuous policy for broadening the scope of intervention in order to reduce the emissions that are currently not accounted for in this version of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan. We are actively communicating the private sector to encourage them and explore the possibility to implement additional interventions.

The Net-Zero City Action Plan brings together all major interventions planned by the Municipality to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The activities and proposals described in this plan complement the priority projects from local strategies and were estimated to reduce together the GHG emissions to a target level of 81%.

Offsetting measures are already being implemented by Sofia Municipality including actions with major carbon sinks (rehabilitation and/or expansion of the existing parks, green areas, planting of numbers of new trees and creating a green belt around the city).

Considering that achieving climate-neutrality is a joint effort for the entire community, private companies will be continue to be a close partner of the city on the path to climate neutrality, both as sources of technological innovations and also through implementing ESG and carbon neutrality strategies. Thus contributing to the offsetting of a considerable share of residual emissions.

The strategy of the city for offsetting the remaining emissions will be based on the following compensation options:

further development of the green system for managing the absorption of CO2 within the city boundaries
develop forests as natural sinks around the city for managing the sequestration of carbon
soil management to improve topsoil and the ability of the soil to sequester carbon
support and participation in climate-related projects not only at local but also at regional and national level involving third parties.

The actions in industrial sector and the actions not yet quantified or not included (see section B1.1 Impact pathways) may contribute to decrease the offset needs, boosting the savings in IPPU, mobility and buildings sectors.

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

This module details the city's governance innovations for achieving city climate neutrality by 2030, describing innovations in institutional design, in leadership, and in collaborative and outreach processes, whether they are inter-organizational or internal to the key organizations responsible for the city's climate neutrality target.

### C-1.1: Description or visualization of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

Sofia's approach to achieving climate neutrality by 2030 relies on an integrated governance model that aligns existing city administration structures with broader collaborative efforts involving multiple stakeholders. This model incorporates innovative governance structures and participatory processes to ensure comprehensive engagement across sectors and levels of government, as well as with non-government actors.

The governance model integrates various interventions to enhance coordination, improve decision-making, and foster community involvement. These interventions are designed to overcome systemic barriers and capitalize on opportunities identified in the city's climate action strategy. Key elements of Sofia's participatory governance model include:

#### Permanent Climate Neutrality Unit:

The existing Climate Neutrality Transition Unit will be transformed into a Permanent Climate Neutrality Unit within Sofia Municipality and will serve as a dedicated entity within Sofia Municipality to oversee and coordinate all climate actions. This unit is central to the city's efforts to ensure alignment and coherence across various departments and external stakeholders. By providing a dedicated structure, the unit facilitates horizontal collaboration among municipal departments and vertical integration with regional and national authorities. This approach helps streamline decision-making processes, allocate resources efficiently, and maintain consistent policy implementation. The unit enhances organizational cohesion and ensures that climate actions are consistently aligned across multiple sectors and governance levels.

Also improves the effectiveness of climate mitigation efforts and supports sustainable urban development.

#### One-stop Shop for Energy Efficiency

The One-stop Shop for Energy Efficiency represents a key initiative to support citizens and businesses in adopting energy-saving measures. By offering a centralized platform for information on energy efficiency, financial incentives, and support programs, the one-stop shop addresses the challenges related to information accessibility and complexity. This initiative also serves as a hub for engaging the public in energy-saving practices, thereby contributing to Sofia's broader sustainability goals. The shop encourages collaboration between municipal departments, NGOs, and energy service companies, fostering a community-driven approach to energy efficiency.

#### Energy Managers in Municipal Buildings

This initiative involves appointing dedicated energy managers to oversee and optimize energy use in municipal buildings, including schools and administrative offices. These managers are tasked with overseeing energy use, identifying opportunities for savings, and implementing best practices for energy management. This initiative helps to reduce energy consumption and operational costs while demonstrating leadership in sustainable practices. It also creates a feedback loop within the governance model, where data collected and lessons learned can inform broader policy and strategy adjustments.

# Green Public Procurement

Green Public Procurement (GPP) is an innovative strategy that integrates environmental considerations into the purchasing decisions of Sofia Municipality. By prioritizing sustainable goods and services, GPP leverages the city's purchasing power to drive market demand for eco-friendly products and reduce the environmental footprint of municipal operations. This initiative encourages collaboration across various municipal departments and with external suppliers, promoting a circular economy and supporting Sofia's climate neutrality objectives. It also serves as a model for other cities, showcasing how public procurement can be a powerful tool for sustainable development.

# Collaborative Mechanisms and Stakeholder Engagement:

The governance model emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement and public participation in achieving climate neutrality. Sofia employs several mechanisms to involve a broad range of stakeholders:

Horizontal and Vertical Collaboration: The model ensures effective coordination across municipal departments and alignment with higher levels of government. This multi-level governance approach facilitates the integration of local climate actions with national and regional policies, enhancing the overall impact of Sofia's climate strategy.
Partnerships and Networks: Sofia actively engages with NGOs, academic institutions, business associations, and other non-governmental actors. These partnerships are crucial for driving innovation, mobilizing resources, and fostering a collaborative environment that supports climate action.
Citizen Participation: Engaging citizens is a core element of the governance model. Sofia uses various tools, including public consultations, and educational campaigns, to ensure that residents are informed, involved, and supportive of climate initiatives. Digital platforms, such as the One-stop Shop for Energy Efficiency, also play a key role in facilitating citizen engagement and providing accessible information on sustainability practices.

Sofia's governance model directly addresses key barriers and leverages opportunities. For example:

Centralized Coordination: The Permanent Climate Neutrality Unit addresses the barrier of fragmented efforts by providing a dedicated structure for coordination, enhancing overall effectiveness and ensuring sustained action towards climate neutrality.
Market Stimulation: Green Public Procurement takes advantage of the opportunity to use municipal purchasing power to encourage market demand for sustainable products, contributing to emission reductions and promoting the circular economy.
Access and Engagement: The One-stop Shop for Energy Efficiency addresses barriers related to information access and resource availability, supporting broader adoption of energy-efficient measures and contributing to the impact pathway of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

By integrating these innovative governance structures and participatory processes, Sofia is committed to achieving climate neutrality through inclusive, effective, and sustainable climate action.

SUMMARY

Sofia Municipality has undertaken an inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the year 2022, aligning with its commitments under the Covenant of Mayors European initiative and the Compact of Mayors Global Platform. This inventory utilized methodologies from the Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs) guidelines, specifically Part II on Basic Emissions Inventory, the Global Protocol for GHG Emissions Inventory, and the IPCC's 2006 Guide for National GHG Inventories.

The inventory encompasses several sectors: residential, tertiary and municipal buildings, equipment and facilities, industry and construction, agriculture and forestry, accidental emissions from natural gas supply, transportation (road, rail, and aviation), and waste and wastewater management. Data was gathered from municipal sources as well as numerous public and private organizations. It includes all 24 administrative regions within the municipality.

In terms of energy consumption, the total for the municipality reached 10,060,567 MWh in 2022, a reduction of 12% from 11,437,985 MWh in 2018.

Regarding emissions, the total for 2022 was 4.2 million tons of CO2-equivalent, down from 4.6 million tons in 2018, reflecting a decrease of 8%.

Households (43%), industry (21%), road transport (16%) and trade and services (13%) being, in that order, the prominent sources of emissions.
# INTRODUCTION

Global climate change is the phenomenon that will cause the greatest upheaval in human history. The origins of this phenomenon are well documented: according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities are the main cause of this change (IPCC, 2021). The combustion of fossil fuels in industry and transport, as well as the destruction of natural areas, such as deforestation and soil mineralization, are the main culprits.

The increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is unbalancing the planet's energy balance by preventing solar and infrared radiation from escaping into space. This imbalance leads to an average rise in global temperature and disrupts climate events and phenomena.

In its latest report (2021), the IPCC stresses that climate change is becoming more widespread, accelerating and intensifying, while efforts to limit the rise in average temperature to 1.5°C by 2100 are not enough: in 2022, the rise was already 1.2°C.

In SOFIA, climate change is already having an impact: shorter winters, longer droughts and extreme weather events such as heat waves and heavy rain. These phenomena pose a risk to the survival of human society as a whole, and are disrupting our daily lives because of the disasters they cause: summer flooding, loss of agricultural yields which is exacerbating price rises, deaths linked to heatwaves, the emergence of climate refugees, loss of biodiversity, the emergence of new diseases, etc.

In response to this situation, Bulgaria and its capital Sofia have set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, following the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015. By 2030, Sofia aims to have reduced its emissions by 80% compared with 2018, a significant reduction for the European capital.

Initiatives in Sofia include expanding public transport infrastructure, promoting the use of renewable energy, improving the energy efficiency of buildings, and creating new green spaces to help absorb carbon emissions. These measures are essential to mitigate the impacts of climate change and protect the city and its inhabitants from its future effects.

Well aware that municipalities have responsibilities in the fight against climate change, the city of Sofia first carried out an initial inventory of GHG emissions based on 2015 data. This inventory, made public in 2017, was carried out as part of the Climate Municipality program and included only the inventory of GHG emissions from energy consumption by municipal activities. Based on this inventory, Sofia drew up a GHG emissions reduction action plan in 2017. At the same time, it adopted its first Sustainable Development Plan in 2018, developed in collaboration with local organizations.

In 2018, Sofia undertook a second GHG emissions inventory. This inventory showed modest but encouraging progress, reflecting initial efforts to reduce its emissions by improving public transport infrastructure, encouraging energy efficiency in municipal buildings, and increasing public awareness.

Currently, the 2022 assessment shows significant progress with a notable reduction in GHG emissions. Sofia's initiatives include expanding public transport infrastructure, promoting the
use of renewable energy, improving the energy efficiency of buildings, and creating new green spaces to help absorb carbon emissions.

These measures are essential to mitigate the impacts of climate change and protect the city and its residents from its future effects.

Sofia's ongoing efforts and targeted actions aim to demonstrate a strong commitment to sustainability and resilience in the face of future climate challenges.
# 1 Content of the project

The GHG emissions inventory for Sofia Municipality was prepared through a systematic process involving five key steps:

Source identification: The inventory covered sectors consistent with previous GHG emissions inventories for Sofia Municipality.

Methodology selection: Approaches were chosen to align with the Covenant of Mayors requirements, the Global Protocol, and IPCC guidelines, including the latest national inventory guidelines.

Data collection: Primary data was gathered from municipal sources, official inquiries to institutions and organizations, and questionnaires sent to municipal enterprises, companies, and buildings. Data was verified and corrected as needed.

Emission factor selection: Standard IPCC emission factors were primarily used, supplemented Country-specific emission and conversion factors where appropriate.

Calculation tool development: Transparent and systematic MS Excel-based tools were created for automated GHG emissions calculations. These tools, containing all necessary data and factors, were provided to Sofia Municipality for use in future inventories.

This approach ensures a comprehensive and consistent method for quantifying GHG emissions across various sectors in Sofia Municipality, facilitating accurate reporting and future comparisons.
Methodology

The direct GHG emissions inventory is only based on final energy consumption within the municipality, including electricity, heat, solid fuels, and renewable energy sources

The project conducted a comprehensive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory, encompassing:

Direct CO₂ emissions from stationary and mobile combustion within the municipality
Indirect emissions from heat and electricity consumption, regardless of production location
Other direct emissions, including gas leakage in distribution and solid waste treatment process

Emissions from products or food consumed in the territory of Sofia were not considered in that inventory.

To calculate CO2 emissions, we have taken the following steps:

## Methodology for Stationary sources:

Quantification of fuel consumption: we have begun by determining the amount of each fuel type used, typically measured in mass or volume units (e.g., tons, liters, or cubic meters).
Conversion to energy units: we have used net calorific values (NCVs) to convert fuel quantities into energy units, usually gigajoules (GJ) or megawatt-hours (MWh). The NCV is specific to each fuel type and represents the amount of heat released during combustion...
Individual GHG emissions calculation: we have multiplied the energy values by appropriate emission factors for each greenhouse gas (GHG). These factors are expressed in t CO2/MWh, kg CH4/MWh, kg N20/MWh vary depending on the fuel type and combustion technology. We have performed separate calculations for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions using their respective emission factors.
Conversion to CO2 equivalent: we have used the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of each gas to convert CH4 and N2O emissions into CO2 equivalent. The GWP values represent the warming effect of each gas relative to CO2 over a specific time horizon (usually 100 years).

## Methodology for Road transport:

Identification of vehicle population: this includes vehicle type (motorcycle, car, truck), depollution category and number
Quantification of average yearly mileage in the city per each type of vehicle
Individual GHG emissions calculation: we have multiplied the mileage by appropriate emission factors for each greenhouse gas (GHG). These factors, are expressed in g CO2/km, g CH4/km and g N2O/km.
Conversion to CO2 equivalent: we have used the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of each gas to convert CH4 and N2O emissions into CO2 equivalent.
Uncertainty and precision:

The global uncertainty of this greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory is a composite of two primary sources of uncertainty. The first component stems from the emission factor, which typically carries an uncertainty level of 1 to 2 percent. This relatively low uncertainty is due to the well-established scientific methods used to determine emission factors. The second component, however, introduces a more variable level of uncertainty and is linked to the process of data gathering. This aspect of uncertainty is highly dependent on the specific emission source being measured and the capabilities and methods employed in collecting the relevant data. We will give more detailed information when dealing with each specific source.
Conversion and emission factors

This section presents the conversion and emission factors that have been cited in the methodology and have served throughout the inventory calculation.

# Global warming potential:

Each gas has a unique atmospheric lifetime and its own heat-trapping potential, known as the Global Warming Potential (GWP). With a GWP of 1, carbon dioxide  $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$  is the reference gas against which other gases are compared. GWP is a relative measure of the warming effect that the emission of one kilogram of a GHG has at the tropospheric surface compared with the warming effect of the emission of one kilogram of carbon dioxide (CO2).

The following Global Warming potential have been considered to convert  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  and  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  emissions into  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq emissions.

# Electricity:

We agreed with Sofia that this inventory should be made using the emission factor for electricity at country level. As a consequence, we have taken the 2021 activity based emission factor proposed by the Covenant of Mayor report "CoM-Emission-factors-for-national-electricity-2024".

Table 8
# 4 Sources of emissions

The direct GHG emissions inventory is based on final energy consumption within the municipality, by the following sectors:

Households: residential
Trade and services buildings: Privately owned service sector buildings (e.g., offices, banks, SMEs, retail, hospitals)
Municipal buildings
Industrial activities
Agriculture and forestry
Private and commercial vehicles
Municipal fleet
Public transports
Rail
Public lighting

According to the definition of the Global Protocol, flights with take-off and landing during the same flight on the territory of the municipality (for example local helicopters, small planes, training flights, etc.) should also be taken into account in the inventory. Due to the very limited number of such flights at Sofia airport, emissions from air transport have not been considered.

In addition to emissions coming from final energy consumption, two additional sources of emissions have been considered:

Incidental emissions linked to natural gas distribution
Emissions from waste treatment
# 4.1 Households

GHG emissions from households include energy consumption for heating, air conditioning and hot water, electricity used for household appliances.

For Natural gas, Electricity and Heat Energy we were able to collect data consumption from Sofia Households.

For other fuels, it has only been possible to gather consumption data à country level. We have then used the following structure of households heating in Bulgaria and Sofia to allocate fuel consumption to Sofia city.

Inhabited dwellings by type of energy used for heating

|   | Bulgaria - total | Bulgaria - % | Sofia Municipality - total | Sofia Municipality - % | Share Sofia over country  |

|  Others | 149 034 | 6,1 | 23 632 | 5,1 | 15,9%  |

When collecting the information, respondents were able to indicate more than one answer.

As a result, the energy consumptions per type of fuel that have been used for the inventory are the following ones.

|  Total | 742 882,72 | 241,11 | 3,90 | 1 799 386,89 |   |

Table 12

With a total of 1 799 386 tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq, households are the biggest source of emission of the city (42%) and show an increase by 4% compared to 2018, mainly due to a 3% increase of energy consumption, especially driven by electricity (+10%), which emission factor is higher than any other fuel used by households (see table 4) that does not compensate the reduction of coal use.

Let's note that  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions linked to Wood combustion are not included in the total inventory, as required by the Covenant of Mayor methodology, and is reported separately as biogenic  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ .

# 4.2 Trade and services
For solid and liquid fuels, as for households, we were able only able to gather data at Country level. Allocation at Sofia level has been done using same heating structure table (table 9).

Table 13

For Natural gas, central heating and electricity, we were able to collect data at SOFIA level but as an aggregated consumption for trade &amp; services and industries sectors.

In 2018 GHG inventory, the calculation of the share of consumption for each sector had been made based on the share of electricity consumption for trade &amp; services and industry.

Without any better data we have decided to keep the same splitting rule:  $54\%$  for industry and  $46\%$  for trade and services.

|  Sofia | MWh  |
| --- | --- |
|  Natural gas | 262  |
|  Electricity | 761  |
|  Heat energy | 429  |

Table 14

Based on these energy consumptions and using emission factors for stationary sources (table 3) the results for emissions are the following.
|  Fuel | tCO2 | tCH4 | tN2O | tCO2eq | Bio genic CO2  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Anthracite coal | 51,68 | 0,01 | 0,00 | 52,05 |   |
|  Black coal | 279,47 | 0,03 | 0,00 | 281,53 |   |
|  Lignite | 31,50 | 0,00 | 0,00 | 31,71 |   |
|  Briquettes and brown coal | 1,41 | 0,00 | 0,00 | 1,42 |   |
|  Wood | 977,47 | 2,53 | 0,03 | 73,68 | 977,47  |
|  Propane-Butane | 4 241,29 | 0,34 | 0,01 | 4 251,69 |   |
|  Gas oil / Diesel fuel | 17 454,26 | 1,93 | 0,10 | 17 531,91 |   |
|  Fuel oil | 764,21 | 0,09 | 0,00 | 767,65 |   |
|  Natural gas | 53 106,11 | 4,73 | 0,09 | 53 252,65 |   |
|  Electricity | - | - | - | 386 685,51 |   |
|  Heat energy | 86 752,53 | 1,55 | 0,15 | 86 837,35 |   |
|  Total | 163 659,93 | 11,20 | 0,40 | 549 767,16 |   |

Table 15

With a total of 549 767 tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq, Trade and services represents  $13\%$  of the emission of the city and show a decrease by  $13\%$  compared to 2018, mainly due to a  $11\%$  decrease of energy consumption, especially driven by electricity  $(-25\%)$ .

Let's note that  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions linked to Wood combustion are not included in the total inventory, as required by the Covenant of Mayor methodology, and is reported separately as biogenic  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ .
Municipal buildings

This sector includes all type of buildings owned or managed by the city: Administrative offices, schools, libraries, community centers, etc.

For this sector it was possible to access directly to fuel consumptions, provided by the city services. Unfortunately, due to the timing to gather data, we could only have access to fuel consumption for 63 buildings which is for sure underestimating the real total consumption of that sector.

Collected energy consumption on 63 buildings

|  Sofia | Quantity (t) | MWh  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Electricity |  | 7 045,14  |
|  Heat energy |  | 12 109,95  |
|  Diesel fuel | 18,00 | 209,84  |

To improve the assessment of these emissions we had access to the total rooftop area for Sofia buildings, with some details on their usage.

We the calculated the average energy efficiency in MWh/m2 per type of usage, based on the data gathered on the 63 buildings where energy consumption was available.

Multiplying energy efficiency by the area allowed us to estimate an extrapolated energy consumption for all city buildings.

Extrapolated energy consumption for all city buildings

Table 16

|  Sofia | Quantity (t) | MWh  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Electricity |  | 16305  |
|  Heat energy |  | 55807  |
|  Diesel fuel | 18,00 | 209,84  |

Based on these energy consumptions and using emission factors for stationary sources (table 3) the results for emissions are the following.

Municipal buildings emissions

Table 17

|  Fuel | tCO2 | tCH4 | tN2O | tCO2eq  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Electricity | - | - | - | 8 282,82  |
|  Heat energy | 11 271,16 | 0,20 | 0,02 | 11 282,18  |
|  Diesel fuel | 55,98 | 0,00 | 0,00 | 56,11  |
|  Total | 11 327,14 | 0,20 | 0,02 | 19 621,11  |

Table 18
With a total of 19621 tons of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ eq, municipal buildings represent a minor part of Sofia emissions ($0.5\%$).

Due to the lack of data on that sector, the total emissions for municipal buildings are clearly still a bit underestimated despite our methodology to extrapolate the data we were not able to collect. However, looking back at 2018 inventory (45512 T CO $_2$ eq), even with full data set, municipal buildings emission would remain a minor source.
Industry and construction

For solid and liquid fuels, as for households, we were able only able to gather data for industry at Country level. According to NSI, Sofia industry represents 22% of total industrial activity in Bulgaria. We have then used this 22% share to calculate the energy consumption for Sofia city industry based on consumption at country level.

Fuel consumption by Industry and construction

|  Fuel | Bulgaria | Sofia  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Anthracite coal (t) | 194 692 | 42 975  |
|  Black coal (t) | 165 296 | 36 486  |
|  Lignite | 780 | 172  |
|  Briquettes (t) and brown coal (t) | 33 | 7  |
|  Wood (TJ) | 201 | 44  |
|  Propane-Butane (t) | 44 446 | 9 811  |
|  Gas oil / Diesel fuel (t) | 80 171 | 17 696  |
|  Fuel oil (t) | 28 210 | 6 227  |

Table 19

For Natural gas, central heating and electricity, as already explained in trade and services section, we have calculated the energy consumption based on the share of consumption for industry: 54%

|  Sofia | MWh  |
| --- | --- |
|  Natural gas | 308 685  |
|  Électricity | 893 573  |
|  Heat energy | 504 239  |

Table 20

Based on these energy consumptions and using emission factors for stationary sources (table 3) the results for emissions are the following.

|  Fuel | MWh | tCO2 | tCH4 | tN2O | tCO2eq | Bio genic C02  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

|  Total | 2 649 897,43 | 455 553,66 | 26,25 | 4,87 | 906 616,11 |   |

Table 21

With a total of 906 616 tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq, represents  $21\%$  of the emission of the city and is the second biggest source of emission.

It shows a decrease by  $12\%$  compared to 2018.

Let's note that  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions linked to Wood combustion are not included in the total inventory, as required by the Covenant of Mayor methodology, and is reported separately as biogenic  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ .
# 4.5 Agriculture and forestry

This sector includes local agricultural and forestry activities, which contribute to GHG emissions through the consumption of fossil fuels for agricultural machinery and heated greenhouses.

In terms of data we were here again only able to access energy consumption for agriculture at country level.

According to NSI, agriculture activity in Sofia is accounting for 1,44% of Bulgaria agriculture total Gross Value Added. We then decided to apply this ratio to Bulgaria total energy consumption for agriculture.

With this assumption, energy consumption is structured as follows:

|  Fuel | Bulgaria | Sofia  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Anthracite coal (t) | 2 161 | 31,01  |
|  Black coal (t) | 16 575 | 237,88  |
|  Lignite(t) | 4 582 | 65,76  |
|  Briquettes (t) and brown coal (t) | 50 | 0,72  |
|  Wood (TJ) | 47 | 0,67  |
|  Propane-Butane (t) | 1 599 | 22,95  |
|  Gas oil / Diesel fuel (t) | 129 656 | 1860,80  |
|  Fuel oil (t) | 44 | 0,63  |

Table 22

Based on these energy consumptions and using emission factors for stationary sources (table 3) the results for emissions are the following.

|  Fuel | tCO2 | tCH4 | tN2O | tCO2eq | Bio Genic CO2  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Anthracite coal | 77,68 | 0,24 | 0,00 | 83,96 |   |
|  Black coal | 501,14 | 1,59 | 0,01 | 543,24 |   |
|  Lignite | 46,16 | 0,14 | 0,00 | 49,79 |   |
|  Briquettes and brown coal | 0,66 | 0,00 | 0,00 | 0,72 |   |
|  Wood | 75,31 | 0,07 | 0,00 | 2,04 | 75,31  |
|  Propane-Butane | 66,61 | 0,01 | 0,00 | 66,77 |   |
|  Gas oil / Diesel fuel | 5 786,89 | 0,33 | 2,20 | 6 451,32 |   |
|  Fuel oil | 1,85 | 0,00 | 0,00 | 2,07 |   |
|  Total | 6 556,31 | 2,37 | 2,21 | 7 199,91 |   |

Table 23

With a total of 7200 tons of CO₂ eq, is a very minor source of emission (~0,1%) of the city and remains quite stable compared to 2018.

Here again CO₂ emissions linked to Wood combustion are not included in the total inventory, as required by the Covenant of Mayor methodology, and is reported separately as biogenic CO₂.
# 4.6 Private and commercial vehicles

Private vehicle emissions in Sofia encompass a wide range of sources, including all private and commercial vehicles operating within the city limits. This category includes cars, motorcycles, light-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles. The total number of vehicles in Sofia has been provided by the office for vehicle registration, offering a comprehensive overview of the city's vehicular landscape. It is important to note that emissions calculation do not include vehicles entering the city area but registered outside Sofia: these data were not available at the time of the project.

The composition of Sofia's vehicle fleet plays a crucial role in understanding the city's air quality challenges and the potential impact of emission reduction measures. With an average vehicle age of 13 years, which is older than the EU average, Sofia faces significant challenges in terms of vehicular emissions.

In order to assess the age of each vehicle population, the office for vehicle registration has also provided the EURO standards of each vehicle, that indicates the emissions performance of vehicles.

Sofia Vehicle population (651 707 vehicles)

Table 24
Due to the lack of current data on average urban mileage, an extrapolation was performed using available data from 2007, 2011, and 2015. This extrapolation helped estimate the current urban mileage for vehicles in Sofia.

We checked these extrapolations with the data we had on total average mileage (urban + non urban) making sure that the ration in urban condition was reasonable.

Table 25

As explained in introduction, we have used emission factors coming from previous studies (see table 7 below). And we have considered the following assumptions:

Vehicles up to EURO 4 (2006): we would use 2007 emission factors
EURO 5 Vehicles: we would use 2011 emission factors
EURO 6 Vehicles: we would use 2015 emission factors
Vehicles in "other" category: we would use an average emission factor calculated based on 2007 to 2015 emission factors

As emission factors variation along the years is very small (&lt;&lt;3%), the resulting precision remains acceptable, knowing that the main uncertainty is coming from the extrapolation of average urban mileage.
As we did not have emission factors for LPG and CNG Light Trucks, we have decided not to take this population into account due to the negligible size of this population.

For electrical vehicle, as electricity is being distributed through power stations, we have applied the emission factor for electricity production (table 4).

Based on these assumptions the resulting emissions are described in the following table:

Private vehicles emissions

Table 7

|   | Total | 602 231 | 81 | 18 | 609 574  |

Table 26
With a total of 609 574 tons of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ eq, Private vehicles are the third largest source of emission (14%) of the city. The total amount of emission shows a reduction of 29% compared to 2018 mainly due to the huge reduction of the number of vehicles (-23%) registered in Sofia. This data should be checked and consolidated for the next inventory update, in order to confirm the trend.

Another aera of improvement would be to try and gather data about vehicles entering the city area each day, while being registered outside the city.
# 4.7 Municipal

Municipal fleet emission calculation encompasses all vehicles owned by the municipality and used by municipal agents.

As fuel is being distributed by the municipality, it was easy to access directly to the total quantity of fuel consumed.

Municipal fleet fuel consumption

|   | FUEL | Quantity (t)  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Cars | GASOLINE | 112  |
|   |  DIESEL | 80  |
|   |  LPG | 0  |

|   |  LPG | -  |
|   |  NATURAL GAS | 0  |
|   |  Elecrtic |   |

Using the fuel consumptions and the emission factors for "Road fuel based" (table 6), we found the following emissions.

Table 27

Table 28

With only 3 528 tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq, the municipal fleet is a negligible source of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions compared to private vehicles.
# 4.7 Public transport

Public transport encompasses all transportation means used to transport passengers during the day within the city limits: busses, trolley-busses, trams and metro.

For those transportation we were able to directly access to fuel consumption, as follows:

Fuel consumption for Public transport

|  Energy type | Total energy amount (MWh)  |
| --- | --- |
|  Diesel | 67 593  |
|  CNG | 134 330  |
|  Electricity Bus + trolley | 26 386  |
|  Electricity rail | 69 582  |

Table 29

We then applied the emission factors for "Road fuel based" (table 6) and the emission factor for electricity production (table 4).

Here below are the resulting emissions for the sector:

Public transport emissions

|  Energy type | tCO2 | tCH4 | tN2O | tCO2eq  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Diesel | 18 232,76 | 0,28 | 0,65 | 18 434,83  |
|  CNG | 27 013,85 | 6,03 | 0,29 | 27 252,14  |
|  Electricity Bus + trolley |  |  |  | 13 404,09  |
|  Electricity rail |  |  |  | 35 347,66  |
|  Total | 45 246,61 | 6,31 | 0,95 | 94 438,71  |

Table 30

With a total of 94 438 tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq, public transports only represent  $0,22\%$  of total emissions with a little increase of  $7\%$  compared to 2018. That shows an increase in the use of public transportation, which is a good thing, globally.
# 4.8 Rail transport

Rail transportation emissions take into account emissions coming from the use of trains within the city boarders.

Sofia city is using in the same time, electric trains and diesel trains.

We were able to access directly to fuel distributed for rail usage.

For Diesel Fuels, we collected total quantities and we had to calculate the share of fuel consumed within the city limit. To do so we multiplied the total amount of fuel by the ratio between route length in the city and total route length (4,1 %).

Fuel consumption for Rail transport

|   | FREIGHT |   | Passengers  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Quantity (t) | Energy (MWh) | Quantity (t) | Energy (MWh)  |
|  Diesel | 14,48 | 168,76 | 22,07 | 257,29  |
|  Electricity |  | 8 385,74 |  | 16 912,99  |

Table 31

We then applied the emission factors for "Road fuel based" (table 6) and the emission factor for electricity production (table 4).

Emissions for Rail transport

|   | Freight |   |   |   | Passengers |   |   |   | Total  |   |   |   |

Table 32

With only 12 978 tons of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq, the rail transport is a negligible source of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions compared to other public transports, while increasing by  $20\%$  compared to 2018, mainly due to an increase energy consumption (traffic increase) and the increase of electricity emission factor compared to 2018.
# 4.9 Public lighting and traffic lights

This sector was very simple to assess as we had direct access to electric energy consumption for lighting and traffic lights.

The results are as follows.

Emissions for public lighting and traffic lights

|  Fuel | MWh | tCO2 eq  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Electricity | 45 | 23  |
|   |  555,38 | 142,13  |

Table 33
# 4.10 Accidental emissions from gas distribution

The assessment of the GHG emissions linked with gas distribution was prepared according to the 2006 IPPC methodology, using emission factors of 0.051 kg CO₂/1000m³ and 1.1 kg CH₄/1000 m³ delivered natural gas. The total quantities of natural gas delivered on the territory of Sofia Municipality, according to the data of Overgas Networks AD are used as primary data.

Accidental emissions

|  Total gaz consumption (m3) | t CO2 emissions | t CH4 emissions | t CO2 eq Emissions  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  455 078 852 | 23 | 501 | 12538  |

Table 34

Accidental emissions have been divided by 2 since 2018, with a direct link with total amount of gas distributed that has also been divided by 2.
# 4.11 Waste

This sector was the most difficult to assess.

We only had access to the total amount of waste collected (304 894 tons) and the percentage of waste recycled per type of waste.

We also had the total amount of waste going for Refused Derived Fuel (RDF) to be incinerated in Cementery outside the city borders.

No indication on the morphology of RDF was available, nor the type of technology used to incinerate the RDF.

We then decided to use average pessimistic values for Net Calorific Value and for Emission factor for RDF that we found in the literacy.

With those assumptions, that leave a great place for uncertainty, the results for waste emissions are the following.

Emissions from RDF incineration

|   | Quantity t | Net Calorific Value | Energy MWh | Emission factor t CO2/MWh | CO2 eq (t)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  RDF | 79 809 | 3,3 | 263369 | 0,75 | 197 527  |

Energy consumption

Table 38
Most used fuels are undoubtedly Electricity (first) and Heat energy (second). Liquid, solid, and gaseous fuels seem to have been reduced a lot but that hides the reality.

Indeed, there is two issues there:

Heat energy is prominently produced with Natural gas which is a fossil fuel.
Electricity appears to be produced with a very inefficient process. The consequence is that electricity emission factor (0,508 t/MWh) is by far worse than any other fuel emission factor, even fossil fuels. The more electricity is consumed, the more the CO2 inventory increases

## Some Levers to be studied

Try to improve the way electricity is produced in order to reduce the CO2 emissions each time sectors stop fossil fuels to use electricity
For households:
a. work on improving building isolation in order to reduce the total demand for energy
b. Improve efficiency of devices used by the dwellings and shift from fossil to electricity (provided that point 1 has been treated)
Trade and services: same levers as households
Transports:
a. Promote the use of public transportation
b. Promote shared usage of vehicles: current average number of passengers by car is 1,2
c. Organize clean delivery of goods within the city to reduce the number of kilometers with light or heavy Diesel trucks.

# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

Sofia is an old European city rich in history and cultural heritage, with historical artefacts, green parks, and beautiful natural surroundings with diverse flora and fauna that make up the city's rich biodiversity, as well as modern buildings. A significant part of the territory is occupied by post-socialist residential areas, characterized by massive residential blocks.

It's a challenge and a mission of the local government to transform the city into a modern, innovative, resilient and sustainable one.

Based on Sofia's consistent policy of becoming a cleaner, greener, and more livable city, the Mayor of Sofia decided in 2022 to participate in the European Commission's invitation to become one of the 100 European cities committed to achieving climate neutrality and becoming smart cities by 2030. This decision is the result of continuous work in various sectors in collaboration with academic institutions, private companies, and local stakeholders.

Our motivation for participating in the EU Mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" is based on our ambition to improve the urban environment and achieve our goal of climate neutrality for the sustainable well-being of our community. Our participation in the Cities Mission also provides broad access to good practices and innovations in dealing with the adverse effects of climate change and better adaptation to its impact. This is an ambition we deserve.

The municipality's commitment to climate neutrality is not a new development. As early as 2011, the mayor signed the Covenant of Mayors (CoM), setting a target to reduce emissions by 22% by 2020, in line with EU policies at the time. In 2015, a letter of commitment was also signed with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM).

In 2022, the final GHG inventory for year 2020 reported according to the requirements of the CoM following the SEAP 2012-2020 of Sofia, showed that Sofia had even exceeded the set target and achieved a 24,7% reduction in GHG compared to the levels of the base year 2007. This was the reason for setting a new ambitious target for reducing emissions by at least 40% up to 2030 and committing to climate neutrality by 2050.

Sofia has a full library of strategic documents setting goals and plans in various sectors having great impact on climate neutrality and green transition, major of them being:

The Vision for Sofia – a comprehensive urban sustainable development strategy covering all sectors of life
The Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan setting the vision and goals in the sector of transport and mobility
The Waste Management Program defining the goals and ways of achieving a better waste management system and reducing the waste.
The General Urban Planning Master Plan of Sofia, setting the requirements on urban planning and land use
The Environmental Management Program defining the sustainable solution to environmental problems and improving the state of the environment in order to ensure a good quality of life for the residents of the municipality and minimize the risks to human health.

The outstanding strategic document of Sofia bringing forth the commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 40,6%; to reduce energy consumption and to increase the share of RES in final consumption up
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

to 2030 is the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) that is complemented by all above mentioned strategic documents.

In recent years, the importance of environmental efforts has gradually become an important priority for Sofia Municipality, and today the strategic documents related to the development of the city of Sofia also include the implementation of specific measures to ensure sustainable development of the city, including waste management, improving the quality of ambient air, water, forests and planned afforestation, turning parks and open urban spaces into desirable recreation areas, preserving the city's green system, etc.

On the road to climate neutrality Sofia had implemented quite a number of initiatives and projects funded mainly by European and own funds. All projects and solutions for climate neutrality actions are science-based and supported by the academic society in Sofia via two scientific councils established within the municipality – a Scientific Council on Ambient Air Quality Improvement and a Scientific Council on Climate and Climate Change.

Thanks to the collaboration with scientific and academic communities, several important research documents have been created in Sofia Municipality, which have been developed with scientifically based solutions to issues related to climate neutrality.

A research on the good practices to tackle the effects of the Urban Heat Island developed in cooperation with Sofia University in 2019
An investigation of the solar potential of the rooftops of municipal buildings made in 2020 by the Sofia University using innovative technologies installed on drones
A strategic model to reduce the effect of the UHI and a Master plan for the planting and protection of street trees developed in 2021 by the University of Forestry

However, by joining the Mission, we see an opportunity to draw new ideas and benefit from the best practices of participating cities, as well as to have unlimited access to knowledge and expertise at the European and global levels. In this way, Sofia will rank among the leading cities in applying opportunities to tackle the challenges of climate change and transferring the accumulated knowledge to other cities in Bulgaria and around the world.

Additionally, the financial opportunities and expertise that the Mission provides through the established Capital Hub will help Sofia to better utilize available resources and secure additional funding on its path to climate neutrality.

## 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

### Goal

SM has sought to strike a balance by enacting policies to allow the city to catch up to the European and global economic and industrial leaders while retaining its identity as a millennial historical and green city. This strategic vision has been put forward and championed by the local government. The continued priorities have been transport and mobility, waste treatment, ambient air quality, open green spaces, and digitalization and innovation.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Sofia, a city committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2030, within the framework of the EU Mission "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030"

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

As mentioned above, in 2015, becoming a member of the GCoM and complying with the policy requirements of the initiative, Sofia had developed and adopted a Sustainable Energy Action Plan for the period 2012-2020, under which four inventories of the GHG emissions had been made – in 2011, in 2015, and in 2018. The final inventory for reporting the implementation of the SEAP 2012-2020 was prepared in 2022 for the year 2020. In 2021, the preparation of Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan of Sofia Municipality 2021-2030 (SECAP 2021-2030) started with a baseline inventory for year 2018. The plan was adopted in December 2021, setting the target of min. 40,6% GHG emissions reduction by 2030 (target year), compared to the levels in 2007 (base year). This target was set for the entire administrative territory of the municipality and was in full compliance with the EU targets. The target covers all sectors considered by the Mission Cities and Scope 1 and Scope 2 as per the Global Protocol. Gases for which the inventory had been prepared include $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ and the emissions had been calculated in $\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$.

Inventories of GHG in Sofia Municipality exclude the ETS facilities within the city, except for the district heating that is the major source of heat energy in the city.

The Municipality of Sofia, considers the ambitious goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2030 not only as a response to the global climate crisis and European policy requirements and restrictions but also as a chance to foster a sustainable, healthier, greener, and equitable city for all its residents.

Our commitment to climate neutrality by 2030 is expressed in our declared participation in the EU Mission for "100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" and encompasses the entire territory of Sofia Municipality. Sofia Municipality is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 81% from the baseline level and, considering that 52% of the city's territory is green, we believe that the city can achieve its high ambitions.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

# SOFIA OBJECTIVE : CLIMATE NEUTRALITY BY 2030

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The main areas to focus on in Sofia Municipality are the transport, stationary energy (buildings), and waste. However, we are well aware that the emissions from some sectors cannot be fully addressed by 2030. For these areas, we plan to develop a strategy, outlining the strategic actions to tackle these sectors by 2050.

Our commitment extends beyond the simple reduction of GHG. Our vision for Sofia Municipality in 2030 is for the city to be a green, innovative &amp; digital hub; a centre of pure &amp; renewable energy and sustainability; a preferred destination for investment of high added-value in high tech sectors; an attractive destination to live &amp; work, promoting diversity &amp; inclusion, with a preserved, sustainable urban environment; a strong partner, with a long-term consistent policy of commitment to global efforts for sustainability and against climate change. Our main goals are to transform the city of Sofia into:

A climate neutral city - by implementing the highest standards in terms of energy efficiency and transforming the energy mix towards the use of energy from renewable sources with an emphasis on shared energy production and consumption at the local level
A resource-efficient city – development in compliance with the principles of the circular economy with an emphasis on the protection of the environment and biodiversity and the creation of comfortable and healthy environment for the citizens
An adaptive city - increasing the adaptation capacity to deal with the negative impacts caused by climate change, by developing the regulatory framework and institutional capacity, attracting the attention of the public and business, implementing environmentally friendly solutions for adaptation and increasing the possibilities for prevention and improvement of preparedness and response to extreme climate events

The co-benefits of our actions for climate-neutrality will also influence the equitable distribution of the results and ensure the future generations will inherit a healthy and sustainable city on a green, resilient and sustainable planet. The improvement of energy efficiency and promotion of renewable energy will help the households and businesses in reducing their energy costs.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Furthermore, reducing fossil fuels will also benefit the air quality in the city, providing a healthier environment for people, which has direct social and economic benefits.

In addition, we are dedicated to transforming Sofia into a smart city by using innovative technologies and ensuring reliable data and digitalization to improve the quality of life, sustainability, and efficiency of urban activities and services.

Our commitment to climate neutrality by 2030 is a proof of our decisiveness to tackle climate change and ensure a safer and brighter future for the city community.

Together with the local stakeholders, we see the ambitious goal to reach at least 80% reduction of GHG emissions by preparing the Climate Action Plan as the basis for finding solutions and competencies for building a greener, low-carbon future.

On our journey we are led by several key principles such as *integrity, innovation, accountability, transparency, and partnership*. We believe co-creation is a must for achieving our goals as well as engaging multiple actors and citizens, and implementing systemic and demand-driven actions. We consider the monitoring and joint learning will guarantee measurable results from our actions and will make our progress transparent.

In the field of governance, on the road towards climate neutrality, we are considering the role of the transition team to grow into constant monitoring body focusing on planning, managing and monitoring actions for climate neutrality. This unit, under the supervision of the Mayor, will target the implementation and improvement of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan of the city of Sofia. We are considering to create a new tool for monitoring and reporting as well as closer relation of the team with the local community via digital media like dedicated platforms and sub-sites. This innovative approach will ensure that our city is ready to tackle the challenges ahead and to seize the opportunities that come with the transition to a climate-neutral future.

Due to the turbulent political events in the country characterised by several subsequent national elections campaigns and considering the fact that just before submission of the CCC of Sofia Municipality new elections will be held, most probably the national government commitment will be attached to Sofia’s contract after submission, but before the end of the year 2024.

We believe the national government elected will embrace the opportunity to commit to Sofia’s CCC since the actions of the biggest city in the country are of vital importance for achieving the national goals in view of climate neutrality, energy efficiency and circular economy.

## 3 Strategic priorities

### Strategic priorities

Our strategic priorities include (1) promoting sustainable transport and mobility, (2) energy renovation of buildings, as well as stimulating digital innovations in energy management in buildings and street lighting, (3) improving waste management and the efficient use of resources. These priorities are in line with and complement our Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan, Waste Management Plan, and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan.

These ambitious goals will lead to real, measurable changes in the energy system and buildings, the transport and mobility system, and the waste management system. They will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions with 41% to cover the established shortfall to 81%.

In achieving this goal, Sofia Municipality needs support, coordination, and joint efforts with all stakeholders. Each plays a key role in this ambitious project by bringing unique perspectives and
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

essential resources to ensure the success of this transition. Therefore, we will identify additional stakeholders to be involved in fulfilling the commitments to achieve climate neutrality.

National authorities play an important role in advancing climate neutrality by providing the necessary funding, establishing favorable regulations, and coordinating national initiatives with local efforts. At the same time, with a decision of the Council of Ministers in November 2023, Bulgaria joined the NetZero Government Initiative – Leading by Example. Ensuring joint actions between local and national authorities will guarantee synergy of efforts and achievement of goals.

The private sector is a driver of innovation and investment in green technologies. By adopting sustainable business practices and collaborating with the municipality, these actors can develop and implement environmentally friendly solutions, stimulating the local economy and contributing to carbon neutrality.

Academic and research institutions provide the scientific knowledge and technological innovations needed to address climate challenges. Their research and development activities are crucial for identifying new solutions, improving existing technologies, and training the next generation of climate leaders.

An important partner for achieving the goals by 2030 are municipal organizations, including public enterprises and municipal management services, as they are responsible for implementing waste management, water supply, and public transport programs. Their participation ensures the sustainable functioning of the city's basic services and contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Finally, citizens and non-governmental organizations play a fundamental role in ensuring strong community support and raising awareness of climate issues. Their active participation through civic initiatives, environmental advocacy groups, and community projects is essential for establishing sustainable behavior and strengthening society's resilience to climate change.

In summary, the success of Sofia's climate neutrality project depends on a comprehensive and inclusive approach where each stakeholder contributes significantly. Their collaboration and commitment create a robust and resilient ecosystem capable of leading the capital towards a sustainable and prosperous future.

The main interventions will cover, but not limit to:

## 1. Promoting Sustainable Transport &amp; Mobility

### 1.1 Invest in public transport

To enhance sustainable mobility and reduce emissions from the transport sector, Sofia city has adopted a broad investment program with priority to:

Electrification and renovation of public transport: We will invest in a comprehensive electrification program, introducing new electric buses, trams, trolley buses and expand the metro lines that provide clean and efficient transportation options.
Diversification and expansion of infrastructure: We will work to create infrastructure that supports and encourages cycling and walking.

### 1.2 Electrify municipal and private vehicles

Sofia will

Promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs) in municipal structures, organizations, and companies;
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Expanding the city's EV charging infrastructure to facilitate the transition to electric transport;
Discussing incentives and institutional support to encourage residents and businesses to adopt electric vehicles, contributing to the reduction of emissions and improvement of air quality.

## 2. Enhancing Building Energy Efficiency

### 2.1 Phased energy renovation of municipal buildings

Reduce energy consumption in existing buildings, by the introduction of:

Energy-Efficient Technologies: insulation, efficient lighting, smart heating and cooling systems in existing buildings;
Energy Audits: to identify areas for improvement and guide retrofit efforts effectively.
Energy Management Systems: installation of smart metering devises and automated control systems

### 2.2 Net-Zero Building Standards

Sofia is committed to working together with stakeholders to create regulations that ensure new projects meet the highest standards of energy efficiency and promote the construction of carbon-neutral buildings.

## 3. Circular Economy and Sustainable Consumption

### 3.1 Waste Management

Sofia recognizes the importance of waste reduction and the principles of the circular economy and continuously works to improve its sustainable waste management practices in accordance with national and European regulations.

Waste Reduction and Recycling

We will continue to make efforts to reduce waste generation at the source and promote recycling throughout Sofia Municipality by applying the "polluter pays" principle. We are ready to implement recycling programs to encourage residents and businesses to effectively separate recyclable materials.

We will conduct extensive educational campaigns to raise awareness about waste reduction, recycling, and responsible consumption practices.

### 3.2 Green Procurements

To further enhance the sustainability of processes, Sofia Municipality will develop, in collaboration with stakeholders, practices for organizing so-called "Green Public Procurement" and will work towards their effective implementation.

The attached Climate Neutrality Action Plan until 2030 provides detailed information on the implementation of the priorities and interventions described above, including timelines, funding sources, and collaboration with stakeholders.

We are collectively dedicated to making Sofia greener, healthier, more resilient, and more sustainable for the benefit of the entire local community and the global environment.

# 4 Process and principles

## Process and principles

### 1. Process

The systematic process followed strictly the basic framework for effective action planning set out in the Info Kit for Cities, the Climate Transition Map and the Theory of Change Model.

The process of outlining the city's commitments to achieving climate neutrality began back in 2017 when a specialized structure was established in Sofia Municipality—the "Climate, Energy, and Air" Directorate. This directorate is responsible for matters related to policies addressing climate change and air quality.

The municipality's efforts are also supported by: the Coordination Unit, which monitors the progress of SECAP 2021-2030 and the implementation of the "Energy Efficiency First" principle; the Scientific Council on Climate and Climate Change, which participates in project discussions and policy development; and the newly established innovative structure. To support the process of developing the Climate Neutrality Contract, a Unit for Transition to Climate Neutrality was formed.

The inclusion of stakeholders is an important step in the process of outlining commitments to increasing climate neutrality. In this direction, a Communication Strategy for SECAP 2021-2030 has been developed and implemented. A one-stop shop has also been created, providing advice and support to citizens regarding energy consumption and savings, energy efficiency, and the use of renewable energy sources (RES). Additionally, the platform "Sofia Chooses" allows citizens to propose and co-design projects and participate in their implementation.

Within the framework of the Climate Neutrality Contract implementation, existing cooperation with various stakeholders will be further expanded, and new partnerships will be created to achieve the ambitious goals.

The process of development and implementation is detailed in Section 1.5 of the attached Climate Neutrality Action Plan. It follows the Transition Map and the Theory of Change of NZC and is based on four pillars:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

## IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS

In the process of co-creation we organised several meetings with stakeholders and the most important one was the meeting with business representatives where the objectives and targets were discussed broadly and in detail. The result of this meeting was the readiness for engagement in the co-design process and the start of continuous communication. Due to the great delay of starting the activities for developing
Climate-Neutrality
Commitments

the CCC, private stakeholders could not prepare their actions to be included in this first version of the CCC and only few private partners confirmed their commitment by provided a list of actions, which implementation will support the achieving reduction in the carbon footprint of the city – the operator of Sofia Airport (fully within the territory of Sofia City), the operator of the Water Utility in the municipality and CleanTech – a business network that focuses on clean technology, innovation and sustainable development.

## 2. Monitoring and Management of the Climate Neutrality Contract (CCC)

The monitoring of the Contract's implementation will be based firstly on clear data collection procedures and secondly on procedures for tracking progress in the implementation of the established indicators (detailed in Section 3.3 of the attached Climate Neutrality Action Plan).

The collected information will be analysed to anticipate potential implementation problems and outline possible approaches to overcome them.

The monitoring process will include:

a. Annual review of action progress and informing the community – An annual review will be conducted to determine the need for updates, depending on the development of the local context, as well as local, national, and European legislation in relation to climate neutrality.

b. Periodic evaluation and review of the results of implemented projects and activities – At least twice a year, or more frequently, monitoring sessions will be organized for the Transition to Climate Neutrality Unit to address any arising issues as quickly and effectively as possible.

c. Regular review of Sofia's Climate City Contract (CCC) by specialized structures and organizing joint sessions between the Transition Unit and the Scientific Council on Climate and Climate Change to address gaps, discrepancies, or incompatibilities with policies and/or regulations, if applicable. The timeline for the periodic review of the CCC is presented in the roadmap below:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

ROADMAP

The Climate Contract has a horizon until 2050, which is a long-term effort encompassing actions and initiatives across various sectors and with different stakeholders. For this reason, we envision the management of the contract to be organized as follows:
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

a. The "Climate, Energy, and Air" Directorate in the Sofia Municipality Administration will conduct regular monitoring of the Contract's implementation, maintain continuous communication with stakeholders, and support the work of the "Transition to Climate Neutrality Unit";

b. The existing "Transition to Climate Neutrality Unit" will become a permanent entity with its composition updated to include representatives from the stakeholders who signed the contract. The main responsibilities of the Unit will be to strategically monitor the progress in implementing the planned measures, provide guidance, and propose solutions to any challenges that arise. The Unit will meet regularly, but not less than once every six months;

c. Enhancing the role of the "Scientific Council on Climate and Climate Neutrality" by involving it at the earliest stage in discussions of potential measures for achieving climate neutrality.

## 3. Principles

Sofia Municipality follows several guiding principles that form the roadmap to the city's climate neutrality and strengthen its role as a model for innovation and pioneering:

**Accountability**: Conducting periodic reporting to the structures responsible for monitoring and managing the Contract and to the public. We remain open to external evaluation and feedback.

**Co-Design/Co-Creation**: Engaging stakeholders, including citizens and businesses, in the development and implementation of the Climate Neutrality Contract (CCC) to ensure it meets their needs and priorities. Citizens participate in proposing and selecting specific projects. They are regularly involved in public discussions on actions proposed by the municipality, and businesses are encouraged to take measures for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

**Innovation**: Utilizing innovative ideas and approaches that can support our path to climate neutrality.

**Social Participation**: Considering social impact in the planning and implementation of the Contract. This will allow for the identification of barriers to the participation of vulnerable social groups in CCC actions, and our intention is to ensure a just transition for all.

**Systematic and Demand-Driven Approach**: All proposed actions are integrated systematically and are driven by the needs and priorities of the citizens for their well-being. Our strategy includes integrated interventions.

**Monitoring and Joint Learning**: Continuous monitoring of implementation, and revision and enhancement of the Contract. It is a "living document" and must be continually reviewed, refined, supplemented, and adapted. Through constant monitoring of the reliability and relevance of the measures, we share what we've learned with other cities and assimilate their lessons, using the opportunity to apply different, better, and more efficient measures if necessary. Therefore, we will continue to improve the established processes and structures that allow for flexible actions and responses.

The purpose of this document is to unite our commitments and provide a roadmap for Sofia Municipality to improve its climate neutrality. In this document, we reaffirm our determination to combat climate change, and it serves as a guide for our ongoing efforts.

We are guided by several key principles such as transparency, accountability, and innovation. We believe in the co-creation of systematic and demand-driven actions. With this, we commit to comprehensive monitoring and joint efforts that ensure our actions will be effective and our progress measurable.

We are fully aware that the Climate-Neutral City Contract is a living document that will be continuously reviewed and periodically updated in view of its effectiveness, accountability to commitments, and the engagement of new stakeholders in accordance with financial and monitoring cycles.

Being fully aware that Sofia Municipality could not achieve all above depicted goals alone, we have engaged few private partners – SOF CONNECT, the operator of Sofia Airport, VEOLIA Sofiyska Voda AD, the WWW utility company in Sofia Municipality region and CleanTech OOD – a business network focused on clean technology, innovation and sustainable development. Their commitments to support our efforts along climate neutrality path are presented in detail in the Climate Neutrality Action Plan of Sofia annexed herewith.

Our commitments are the result of a co-creation process with local, regional, and national stakeholders, establishing new ways of thinking and working together to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

Our overall goal is to achieve systemic change in the city, including in the sectors with the highest emissions in the city.

We believe that our commitments will lead to significant change, which will have a positive impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the city of Sofia.

We, the undersigned, commit to joining our efforts to make Sofia Municipality climate neutral by 2030.

We agree with the shared vision and commitments formulated in this document and will contribute to achieving our common goals.

This commitment document and its annexes, which are an integral part of it, have been developed through an iterative process as a dynamic and flexible document that will be subject to monitoring, updating, and modification to review and adjust the commitments, actions, and/or investments necessary to achieve the city's climate neutrality goals. It represents a manifestation of our collective will, shared vision, and firm commitment to a sustainable and climate-neutral future.

CLIMATE-NEUTRALITY COMMITMENTS

The Association of commercial building owners in Bulgaria (ACBO) is a voluntarily, non-political, and non-governmental organization. Founded in 2013, it incorporates around 50 companies, owners of commercial buildings and associated members (companies involved in the real estate business) with total built-up area of more than 1,000,000 square meters, located in the Republic of Bulgaria, as the majority of the buildings are located in the city of Sofia.

Sofia's climate neutrality ambition by 2030 is a bold yet necessary commitment to ensuring the city's long-term environmental and economic sustainability.

ACBO is committed to contributing to this city-wide goal by focusing on two critical areas: energy savings and waste reduction within commercial buildings in Sofia. ACBO's goal is to promote among its members actions and activities which lead to significant reductions in energy consumption and waste production by 2030, aligning with the city's broader climate neutrality targets. While some areas, such as heritage buildings, may present challenges in achieving full climate neutrality by 2030 due to preservation constraints, ACBO is willing to address these areas beyond 2030, implementing gradual improvements and integrating new technologies as they become viable.

ACBO's commitment is further bolstered by its member organizations, which collectively manage a significant portion of the city's commercial real estate. The Association's efforts aim not only to contribute to reduced GHG emissions but will also promote co-benefits such as improved air quality, enhanced well-being for building occupants, and long-term financial savings through increased energy efficiency.

In order to proactively participate in the achievement of the climate neutrality of city of Sofia by 2030, the ACBO has identified several systemic strategic priorities that will have a profound impact on reducing GHG emissions within Sofia's commercial building sector:
a) Energy Efficiency Improvements

Building Retrofitting: ACBO will spearhead amongst its member an initiative to retrofit existing commercial buildings with energy-efficient technologies, such as LED lighting, smart thermostats, and HVAC systems with higher energy efficiency.
The association will promote the adoption of advanced energy management systems (EMS) across its member buildings. These systems will optimize energy use, reduce waste, and provide real-time data to track progress towards energy reduction goals.

b) Renewable Energy Integration

On-Site Renewable Energy: ACBO will encourage amongst its members the installation of solar panels and other renewable energy sources on commercial building rooftops. This will reduce reliance on fossil fuels and contribute directly to the city's renewable energy targets.
Green Energy Procurement: The association will explore opportunities for bulk purchasing agreements with green energy providers, enabling members to transition to 100% renewable energy sources more cost-effectively.

c) Waste Reduction

Waste Audits and Reduction Plans: ACBO will promote amongst its members the need of minimizing waste generation at the source and increasing recycling rates.
Circular Economy Initiatives: The association will promote the adoption of circular economy practices, such as using recycled materials in construction, the use of materials produced in the vicinity of the construction site etc.

d) Stakeholder Engagement and Capacity Building

Education and Training: The ACBO will encourage its members to participate in d training programs for building owners, managers, and tenants which raise awareness about energy efficiency and waste reduction strategies. Work meetings, presentations and other events in this regard shall be held.
Collaboration with Government and NGOs: The association will actively collaborate with Sofia's municipal government, NGOs, and other stakeholders to ensure that its efforts are aligned with the city's overall climate action plan. This includes participating in policy discussions, sharing best practices, and contributing to city-wide sustainability initiatives.

d) Conclusion

The ACBO is fully committed to supporting Sofia's ambition to become a climate-neutral city by 2030. Being a voluntary organization, the Association can only encourage and support its
members to carry out these activities, and is not able to commit to achieving or reporting specific results in these areas. However, it believes that by continuing to implement the above-mentioned initiatives in this field, in accordance with the Association's capabilities and program, it will have a positive impact and contribute to achieving these goals.
