# Abstract

The set of information and opinions presented in this document constitute only preliminary analyses for the purposes of preparing the Climate City Contract, in terms of Warsaw's participation in the European Commission's Mission of 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, and will undergo further evaluation and consultation with key urban internal and external stakeholders. The measures indicated in the document are not binding, define the starting point of the city, and constitute only a description of how to achieve the ambitious reduction target set in the Climate City Contract. The document shows that the city is aware of the risks associated with the climate crisis and the need for innovative, out-of-the-box transformational measures, which can only be achieved through broad collaboration to achieve climate neutrality.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

# 1 Introduction

Warsaw has become a participant in the European Union Mission - 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, which aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. Participating in the Mission constitutes a great challenge for the city and a motivation for even more intensive measures than those envisaged so far in Warsaw's Green Vision (Green Cities and Climate Action Plan) - the city's main document describing pathways to climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest.

When joining the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030", Warsaw declared to setting a reduction target of 80% by 2030 for two city districts. This decision was driven by an awareness of local and systemic possibilities and limitations, which is explained in detail later in the document.

Participating in the Mission and preparing the Climate City Contract, implemented in two selected districts: Praga-Południe and Ursynów mobilise for implementing innovations and bold solutions that will allow achieving climate neutrality in all key sectors of the city's functioning and that can, once tested in the above-mentioned districts, be implemented throughout the city.

Warsaw has been involved in climate action for many years and it is a member of organisations of cities supporting each other in achieving climate goals (e.g. C40, EUROCITIES, Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, ICLEI).

For Warsaw, joining the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" constitutes the following step and the logical consequence in its long-standing climate policy as well as an opportunity to bring the existing goals and plans (described in a comprehensive and systemic manner in the Green Vision for Warsaw - the city's main document being a "road map" for achieving climate neutrality) to a very concrete, operational, local level. It also constitutes an opportunity to obtain substantive and financial support for planned and ongoing operations responding to the increasingly urgent climate challenges as well as the needs of the city and its residents in this regard. It provides an opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences, a chance to learn from each other, to prototype, test, and modify specific solutions as well as gather experiences that can be replicated and used on a larger scale. The participation in the EU Mission is an additional incentive to mobilise all possible stakeholders and resources to implement climate actions. This stimulus is particularly significant in the context in which Polish cities operate: the lack of a coherent climate policy, national reduction targets, sufficient financial resources. This situation is now changing, but the Polish government's efforts today will yield tangible results only in a few years. Meanwhile, with the climate crisis on the rise, cities must already mobilise all their resources to slow down or decelerate adverse climate change.

Warsaw's engagement in the EU Mission "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" is also demonstrated by the fact that the Mayor of the City of Warsaw is a member of the Cities Mission Mayors Advisory Group, a forum of 15 Mission City leaders who will work directly with the European Commission and the NetZeroCities consortium, which supports cities in their activities. The members of the group represent the mission cities before the European Commission by being an advocate for their interests, giving feedback, initiating actions, addressing needs and problems.

This Action Plan is one of the three elements of the Climate City Contract (CCC), alongside the Investment Plan and the Commitments. All three elements are closely interlinked and form a
#

Warsaw

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

comprehensive plan to achieve climate neutrality in line with the objective defined in the Climate City Contract.

The measures described in the document are non-binding - they are a description of how to achieve the reduction target set out in the Climate City Contract, together with the estimated costs and results in terms of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  reduction. The document shows that the city is aware of the risks related to the climate crisis and the transformative actions needed to be taken by all stakeholders - the identified stakeholders - in a collaborative effort to achieve climate neutrality. The detailing of actions, assigning to them the city units and units responsible for implementation will take place in subsequent iterations of the Action Plan, following internal agreements within the City of Warsaw and after detailed arrangements concerning cooperation with key urban stakeholders and as part of participatory processes involving residents. The feasibility of implementing the actions included in the CCC depends also on the availability of funding and other resources necessary to apply for and implement investment and non-investment projects.

# City characteristics

Warsaw is the centre of a metropolitan area with an estimated population of approximately 3 million. Year by year, this number is growing. As of 30 June 2023, there were more than 1.86 million people (GUS data) living in Warsaw, which accounted for approx. 33% of the voivodeship's population. 2,243,000 is the median number of people staying in the city per day (excluding transients), including: 1 million 807,000 residents, 378,000 regular visitors (e.g. residents of the metropolitan area). The capital was also visited by 9 million people in 2022 (according to the "Turystyka w Warszawie. Raport 2022"), which adds up to almost 25,000 people per day.

Warsaw is the largest economic centre in Poland and one of the most important economic centres in Central and Eastern Europe. After the Second World War, the city developed into an industrial and service centre, with the expansion of heavy industry being a priority. In the 1990s, the economic structure shifted to the service sector, including educational services as well as the research and technology development sector. At that time, most of the city's industrial production disappeared, and the most efficient and technologically advanced facilities remained. The service sector accounts for 84% of the city's economy, the majority of which consists of financial services. Warsaw occupies the leading position in the EU market in terms of foreign direct investment. The manufacturing sector in the city accounts for only 5% of the GDP generated in the city. The largest employment is observed in the following sectors: trade (more than 20%) as well as transport and storage (approx. 20%).

The economic characteristic of Warsaw translates into the structure of greenhouse gas emissions, in which the emissions of the industrial sector reach a trace level, while emissions from the stationary energy sector (production and consumption of energy in housing and utility buildings) as well as transport constitute almost 99% of the city's emissions (scope 1 and 2).

Warsaw is characterised by a well-developed public transport network, consisting of buses, trams, two metro lines, as well as urban and metropolitan railways. Public transport is used daily by 45 to 55% of Warsaw's residents. In 2023, public transport in Warsaw served 955.8 million people. Cycling is used by 2% of people on a daily basis and the length of cycle routes in the city is 772.2 km. Warsaw also has the Veturilo urban bicycle system, which was used by 4.9 million people in 2023.

Warsaw is located in central Poland, on the Mazovian Plain. It covers an area of 517 km² and is located by the Vistula, the largest of Poland's rivers. The most characteristic natural feature of Warsaw's landscape is the Vistula Valley, protected under the Natura 2000 European nature network. Warsaw is located in a temperate, transitional climate zone. During the year, continental and oceanic air masses flow over the city, resulting in a wide variety of weather conditions.

Urbanised development areas (technical and transport infrastructure, single- and multi-family housing, production and warehousing with accompanying services, commercial and administrative services as well as large-scale retail facilities) cover more than half of Warsaw's area (approx. 53% of the city's area). At the same time, the capital stands out with its relatively high proportion of land with natural functions, which at the end of December 2023 accounted for approx. 47% of its area.

The city is surrounded by extensive, valuable natural and semi-natural areas. These include forests, grasslands, wetlands, and river valleys, and agricultural areas with fertile soils. Together they form the broad Green Ring of Warsaw. It serves the role of a buffer to the sprawling metropolitan agglomeration. It also constitutes a place of rest and recreation for residents. Approximately 43% of these areas consist in the most environmentally valuable lands, covered by various forms of nature

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

conservation (including a national park, 74 nature reserves, 3 landscape parks, areas belonging to the Natura 2000 network). As much as 27% of the city's area is covered by legal forms of nature conservation. Related areas of high natural value are also located within the administrative boundaries of the capital.

The above conditions make Warsaw a city with great natural potential, favourable for the formation of a blue-green infrastructure system. The highest and high predisposition in this respect is shown by 39% of the areas and moderate by 19%. However, when observing the changes in the functional structure between 2015 and 2023, despite an increase in the area of landscaped green spaces, the city shows a loss in the overall area of land serving natural functions. This results from the development of buildings and, consequently, the loss of woodland, agricultural and former farmland, natural and spontaneous greenery, as well as degraded greenery. This constitutes the result of urbanisation pressures - an increase in the area of residential development, service areas, and transport infrastructure. Therefore, in the area of the blue-green infrastructure, Warsaw needs to increase the level of protection of valuable natural areas, increase the area of urban green space where possible (e.g. through land purchase), improve the quality of urban green space by planting species that provide a wider range of ecosystem services (particularly CO₂ sequestration) and plan urban space well, including as many diverse green areas as possible.

As a result of strong and long-lasting urbanisation processes, the hydrographic network within the boundaries of Warsaw is significantly impoverished in relation to its regional surroundings, and therefore comprehensive measures aimed at its protection, restoration, and renaturalisation are necessary. Therefore, it is particularly important to increase rainwater retention capacity within the city.

## Administrative structure

Warsaw is the capital of Poland and the administrative centre of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, the largest and most populous of Poland's 16 voivodeships. The decision-making and controlling body consists in the Warsaw City Council, made up of 60 councillors, elected in the course of local elections. The Council constitutes a legislative body. The Warsaw City Council is the decision-making and controlling body and therefore decides on the city's most important matters and supervises the activities of the Mayor. The work of the Council is managed by a chairperson elected from among its members who, together with the vice-chairpersons, forms the Presidium of the Council. The Mayor of the Capital City of Warsaw constitutes the executive body. He manages the day-to-day affairs of the city and represents the city externally.

The powers of the Mayor of Warsaw are relatively large because: he sets and enforces various policies (e.g.: public transport, city roads, public buildings, spatial development, and others), he also controls the budget and revenues in the sectors indicated. The Mayor also implements the resolutions of the City Council as well as the tasks of the city as defined by law. His tasks include in particular: preparing draft resolutions of the city council, drawing up development programmes, determining the manner of implementing resolutions, managing municipal property, implementing the budget, employing and dismissing managers of municipal organisational units. In municipal companies, the Mayor is the entity entitled to exercise shareholder rights.

The Mayor carries out the management through the City of Warsaw, which consists of 40 substantive departments, which are the basic organisational units of the office and cover the entire area of Warsaw. Each department is responsible for a different sector of the city's operations. There are also independent organisational units (sports, cultural, educational, welfare, social assistance,
2

Warsaw

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

health care, etc.) and other municipal entities (including municipal companies and companies with municipal participation) within the city structure.

Due to its size and administrative significance, Warsaw performs public administration functions at both municipality and county level. The city is made up of 18 districts, each with its own budget and a district mayor in charge of local affairs, including: housing, education, social welfare, and partly the cultural and sporting activities, as well as green spaces of the respective district.

The districts constitute auxiliary units of Warsaw. The executive bodies in the districts are the district boards, and the legislative and control bodies are the district councils, elected in local elections. The district office constitutes an organisationally distinguished part of the City of Warsaw proper for the district of Warsaw, based in the given district. The work of the district office is managed by the mayor. Sub-level units (housing estate councils, residents' councils) function as auxiliary units in the districts.

Such a complex structure is characterised by a high level of specialisation and a silo manner of operation, in which implementing projects, processes, and operations of an interdisciplinary and systemic nature can sometimes be difficult. Hence the need to set up interdisciplinary bodies within the city to coordinate or manage processes that go beyond narrow specialisation (teams, committees). An example of such a body is the Climate Team, established by the Mayor of Warsaw, which is composed of heads of units of the City of Warsaw and representatives of other municipal entities with the greatest impact on implementing the city's climate policy. The Transition Team working on developing and implementing the Climate City Contract is of a similar nature. It does not yet have a formal character - it will be formally constituted at the stage of implementing the Climate City Contract.

In the Climate City Contract, some of the autonomous municipal entities must be treated as external stakeholders, as they are entities with legal personality and their activities are regulated by laws other than the Municipal Act (e.g. Commercial Companies Code).

Due to the specific structure of Warsaw, which combines two levels of local government (a municipality with the status of a city with county rights), measures developed as part of the Climate City Contract will have to be approved by both Warsaw's authorities, such as the Mayor of Warsaw and the Warsaw City Council, as well as by the bodies of the districts covered by the Climate City Contract: district boards and councils. The competences and tasks of these bodies are defined by the following legal acts and internal regulations: Act of 15 March 2002 on the Capital City of Warsaw System, Statute of the Capital City of Warsaw, and other resolutions of the Warsaw City Council. The specifics and scope of the issues to be addressed by the approval process and the formal classification of the document within the municipal document structure will determine which of them will approve specific plans or actions within the Climate City Contract.

## Key strengths and challenges

Warsaw is a dynamically developing city of diverse character with a mature market that is attractive to investors (the highest concentration of large foreign investors and the largest Polish companies in the country), a thriving academic and scientific centre and the administrative centre of the country. The city is also characterised by a low level of unemployment, a high level of tourist appeal, as well as ambitious, creative, and well-educated population.

Warsaw is also a city with great natural potential (significant share of green areas in the urban space), with well-developed infrastructure, very good and dynamically developing public transport. It also includes an extensive experience concerning implementing major infrastructure investments as

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

well as pro-development and social projects taking advantage of EU funds. It also includes extensive experience in the area of creating various forms of public participation and in involving residents in key decisions and activities of the local government (public consultations, workshops, citizens' panel, participatory budgeting). It uses or develops many smart city solutions (e.g. extensive air monitoring system, technology hubs, various forms of innovation and entrepreneurship support, Integrated Traffic Management System, modern 19115 citizen contact platform, e-services, Energy Management System, Smart Heat Network).

Warsaw has the most extensive district heating network in the European Union and the fourth largest in the world. Its length for 2021 was 1,865 kilometres and 18,300 thermal junctions, covering an area of approximately 20,400 hectares. Local heating systems operate alongside the central district heating network. In Warsaw, nearly 80% of its residents take advantage of district heating.

A number of decarbonisation and sustainability measures are also being implemented in the city, such as the development of low-carbon public transport, standards for developing and maintaining green spaces, consistent measures for developing the blue-green infrastructure, support for developing photovoltaics through, among others, the Municipal Photovoltaics Development Fund and a subsidy scheme for residents, a subsidy programme for replacing old furnaces and solid fuel boilers, investments in biogas plants, the Clean Transport Zone and others.

All of these assets will facilitate implementing the Climate City Contract by taking advantage of: the infrastructure in place and existing activities and programmes, the experience gained, the human capital, and the concentration of science, business and key institutions that can directly engage and support the efforts of the city and citizens on the road to climate neutrality.

As with any large metropolis, Warsaw also faces a number of challenges that will affect the implementation of the CCC and must be taken into account during its development and during the planned evaluation and update activities. Some of these relate to development barriers related to the city itself and its functioning, others are related to barriers at a national level. The main challenges concern territorial constraints in terms of developing blue-green infrastructure and urbanisation pressure on green spaces, the lack of a developed network of local and district centres, the dependence on the National Power Grid (KSE) and the national energy mix based on fossil fuels, the limited direct influence of local government on the level of greenhouse gas emissions in the city (approx. 7.5%), the high cost and unknown scale of energy efficiency needs of buildings, systemic barriers (mainly legislative) to RES development, access to finance for transformational measures.

## The scope and reduction target of Warsaw's Climate City Contract

Warsaw is highly dependent on external factors in its climate neutrality efforts, including the pace of transition away from fossil energy sources at the national level as well as the actions of the private sector and non-local government institutions (more in the Challenges section). Therefore, despite its ambitious aspirations, it has to take into account the existing limitations. Due to this, a selected area of the city - the two districts of Praga-Poludnie and Ursynów, for which greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of 80% by 2030 have been declared in the application for admission to the City Mission. Such an ambitious goal, very difficult to achieve for the entire city, is possible on a more limited scale. Focusing on two districts and the smaller scale of activities will facilitate the involvement of external stakeholders, in terms of Warsaw, in implementing the assumed goal (due to the smaller scale of operation) and will allow to develop cooperation paths that will help, at a later stage, to transform these activities into a system of cooperation on a city-wide level. The reduction
4

Warsaw

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

targets for the entire city are set out in the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP): 40% reduction by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050.

The idea behind preparing the CCC for the two districts was to create so-called local centres (city labs) of climate transformation, progressive areas of the city for testing the possibility of implementing the solutions required to achieve climate neutrality in 2030 across the city. Successful solutions, action paths, innovations, and synergies developed for the districts covered by the Climate City Contract will be analysed on an ongoing basis for applicability in other districts of Warsaw, in order to intensify and complement the implemented decarbonisation measures. The cooperation developed between the city's units, the relationships established with stakeholders, the good cooperation practices in the urban environment, will already be tested and ready for implementation elsewhere.

## Characteristics of the districts covered by the Climate City Contract

The decision to identify two selected areas of the capital, the districts of Praga-Południe and Ursynów, was made because of their diversity and potential in terms of development structure, transport infrastructure, blue-green infrastructure areas, industrial and service development, as well as power grid characteristics. Their specificity results in that most of the solutions that will be needed for decarbonisation efforts in other districts can be tested in them. Moreover, they include a very similar emission structure in relation to that of the entire city, making them representative for Warsaw as a whole in this respect. Thanks to this, Warsaw has the opportunity to develop diverse innovative solutions in response to the various threats posed by the growing climate crisis, which can be replicated across the city. Other reasons for making this choice included the good cooperation to date, the commitment to climate-neutral activities and the awareness of their importance in the quest for climate neutrality and improving the lives of local people.

Whereas, the specific characteristics for the selected districts indicate the opportunities and constraints associated with operation in each sector.

Praga-Południe
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
Figure 2 Plan of Praga Poludnie district

The district is located within the fabric of the city, among dense, relatively old buildings. It is inhabited by 186,145 people (registered population) and is the second most populous district of Warsaw. It has the highest population density in Warsaw: 8332 persons/km² (GUS, Panorama dzielnic Warszawy w 2022) and a high proportion of post-working age residents (65+) among the total population (20.1 - 25.0%).

The district has a relatively high proportion of registered cars per 1,000 residents (almost 800). It is characterised by a high rate of new residential development (8.3%) and has a relatively high proportion of parks, greens, and neighbourhood greenery in the district area (14.8%). The district's current buildings are architecturally diverse.

The Praga-Południe district has 10,174 municipal housing units in its stock, with a total area of 399,023 m². A large part of the premises requires renovation, preparing and implementing which is a long process (several years), especially with the need for deep thermo-modernisation. Carrying out the modernisation requires time due to, among other things, the need to carry out individual energy audits, to produce technical documentation, to obtain approvals and permits, the need to settle claims to properties, to evict buildings for the duration of renovation (which is a lengthy and socially difficult activity, as it often requires the search for replacement premises), to agree with the conservation officer (some buildings are subject to protection). In its stock, the district also includes a considerable number of commercial premises, with a total area of 88,194 m².

The district is home to the scientific research project NEEST (NetZero Emission and Environmentally Sustainable Territories) funded under the Pilot Cities Programme for Mission 100

climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030 from the Horizon 2020 financial mechanism. It aims to prepare a set of innovative solutions ready to be implemented, scaled and replicated on the basis of model implementation simulations, including technical, financial, and environmental, as well as social and MEL (Monitoring Evaluation and Learning) aspects of deep energy modernisation of buildings and revitalising their surroundings.

# Ursynów

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)
Figure 3 Map of the Ursynów district

The Ursynów district is located on the outskirts of the city. It includes a fairly modern, mainly residential building development, also large-scale, with the end of the metro line and a large green area (Las Kabacki nature reserve) surrounding part of the district. The eastern part of the district is dominated by large estates of multi-storey houses built in the 1970s. The western part of the district consists of a small commercial and industrial area and "Zielony Ursynów", a string of former villages with predominantly single-family housing. The district is constantly developing due to its still undeveloped land, attractive location and very good communication with the centre of Warsaw, thanks to the metro line, among other things.

Warsaw

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The population is 150,354 (registered population), making Ursynów the fourth most populous district in Warsaw. The district has an average population density of between 3,000 and 4,999 persons/km² (GUS, Panorama dzielnic Warszawy w 2022 r.). Whereas, it is one of the city's largest districts in terms of area (4,379 ha, or 8.5% of the city's total area). It is also one of the districts with the highest concentration of multi-family housing areas. Ursynów district has a small stock of municipal housing - 494 units with a total area of 23,351 m² and a small stock of commercial premises (with an area of 3,053 m²).

## Links of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan to existing climate policies and strategies.

The overarching strategic document in Warsaw is the #Warsaw 2030 development strategy. It is a general document that defines the city's vision, as well as strategic and operational goals. All documents programming the city's development must refer to the #Warsaw 2030 Development Strategy. Described under Strategic Objective 3. Functional space, the operational objective 3.2. We live in a clean natural environment contains the following provision: "The quality of the natural environment will be improved by reducing emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases into the air, including through popularising renewable energy sources and energy-efficient solutions. Operations in favour of climate protection and adapting the city to climate change will be carried out."

Currently there are works being carried out to update the document, including making climate issues a higher priority by including them in the Strategy as a separate strategic objective or at least as a specific operational objective.

## The documents guiding the climate policy of Warsaw

In the Capital City of Warsaw there are three main documents outlining climate policy and operation in favour of sustainable development:

Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP - Green Cities and Climate Action Plan) - a "road map" containing the city's reduction goals and a description of measures for achieving them, as well as an action plan for a sustainable city, adopted by the Warsaw City Council in 2023.
Climate change adaptation strategy for Warsaw by 2030 with a perspective to 2050. Municipal Adaptation Plan - a document defining the city's policy aimed at preparing and adapting Warsaw to progressive climate change, constituting the policy of Warsaw in terms of taking action to prevent and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. The document describes the key threats resulting from climate change and the associated risk areas for Warsaw and its residents, as well as indicates courses of action through which the City will protect itself against the negative effects of climate change-related phenomena. The city is currently preparing for an evaluation process concerning the document, which will result in making proper adjustments, developing implementation programmes, and creating a monitoring system.
Environmental Protection Programme - this is an executive document for the #Warsaw 2030 Strategy (relating to operational objective: 3.2. We live in a clean natural environment), containing a diagnosis of the environment's state, operational objectives, a description of the areas of intervention and the actions that the city must take to protect the environment (its quality, functions), including climate protection. Work is currently underway concerning a new programme up to 2030, in which the planned measures will be compatible with those described in the Green Vision for Warsaw and the Climate City Contract.

Warsaw

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The city also includes, or is in the process of developing, documents that are strongly linked to climate policy in their area of influence:

Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan for the Warsaw Metropolis 2030+ (SUMP) - a document having the character of a long-term, coherent transport development plan for the area of the Warsaw metropolis - 70 communes and 9 counties with a total area of 6,000 km², with more than 3 million inhabitants. The SUMP includes specific objectives aimed at reducing the negative impact of transport on people and the environment. One of its horizontal objectives (Horizontal Objective II) consists in reducing the environmental and climate impact of transport: "aiming for climate neutrality no later than in 2050, points to the need to reduce emissions from transport in the MW by nearly half already in 2030 (compared to 2019 levels) and a decrease of at least two-thirds thereafter compared to 2030 values. This will be done through extensive sustainable mobility measures, which are linked to the Transport Sector Action Plan.

General Plan - a master planning and development document under development with which the compatibility of local plans and zoning decisions will be examined. This will be a document containing only the basic arrangements allowing the municipality to plan for sustainable and harmonious development. Until 2023, the binding document that regulated spatial planning and development was the Study of Conditions and Directions for the Spatial Development of Warsaw (Studium uwarunkowań i kierunków zagospodarowania przestrzennego Warszawy). The new Study was prepared in 2023, but, due to legislative changes introduced in 2023, it did not become effective, as the Land Use Studies were, by law, replaced by so-called general plans. The General Plan, together with the Development Strategy Warsaw 2040+, is going to determine the direction in which the city will develop over the next twenty years. It will be highly relevant to the measures planned in the Climate City Contract in the sector of blue-green infrastructure development and in the area of (newly constructed) buildings.

The most comprehensive document describing climate policy goals and actions for achieving them is the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP - Green Cities and Climate Action Plan).

It combines two methodologies used around the world: the Green City Action Plan, developed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Climate Action Plan, developed by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. Combining these two methodologies allowed producing a document that is comprehensively based on verified data.

We perceive the Climate City Contract as an acceleration of implementing the Green Vision of Warsaw (GCCAP) for the two districts and as an opportunity to bring the city-wide goals and measures contained in the Green Vision of Warsaw to the local and maximally operationalised level. It will be valuable to learn lessons from their implementation for the city as a whole in order to implement the extended scenario described therein, as well as to adopt new, even more ambitious assumptions by 2030. Implementing the Climate City Contract with its ambitious reduction target for two large districts of Warsaw will also constitute a significant contribution in terms of reducing greenhouse gases on a city-wide scale. That is why we consider the CCC as a process to accelerate and intensify the implementation of the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP) for the two districts that are laboratories for change, for which the proposed actions will achieve a reduction in line with the Mission's targets - 80% relative to the base year.

Therefore, the Action Plan is strongly linked to the actions and goals described in the Green Vision for Warsaw. It is also (in the case of existing documents) or will be (in the case of modified

documents) consistent with other urban strategies and policies. In order to ensure the coherence of the main municipal documents, it is planned to evaluate them from this point of view.

The Green Vision for Warsaw (GCAAP) identifies 3 climate scenarios for the entire city:

A business-as-usual scenario, taking into account the "no additional climate action" emissions projection, which is a scenario that serves as a baseline and comparison for the planned actions.
Reduction scenario, which defines long-term, achievable goals to achieve the Climate Action Plan - CAP. At the same time, they are linked to the short-term goals of the Green City Action Plan covering a 10-15 year time perspective. This scenario assumes a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as an intermediate target (compared to 2007, corresponding to a 35% reduction compared to 2018) and climate neutrality by 2050, at the latest.
Extended Scenario, which is potentially possible to be implemented in the city if two conditions are met: the city will operate in favourable political conditions (Poland's climate policy will be developed, enabling Warsaw to meet its ambitious climate targets) and the city will receive sufficient financial resources (national and European) to implement pro-climate measures. This scenario assumes a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as an interim target (compared to 2007, equivalent to 50% compared to 2018).

The applicable scenario for the entire city is the reduction scenario. Whereas, the main task of the Action Plan is to bridge the emission gap between the 40% reduction target by 2030 assumed in the Green Vision for Warsaw and the 80% target laid down in the Climate City Contract, which is more ambitious than the Extended Scenario conditionally adopted in the Green Vision for Warsaw.

This can be mitigated through scaling and new, innovative solutions. Part of the gap can be filled by increasing the scale and intensity of activities described in the Green Vision for Warsaw in the area of the districts covered by the Climate City Contract. The rest will be filled by additional solutions that complement those described in the Green Vision for Warsaw or by finding new synergies between measures that will increase their effectiveness. Some of these measures are planned in a conditional mode, because their implementation depends on external factors (climate policy of the Polish government, legal solutions, available funding, know-how, and technology). Whereas, to bridge the potential gap between emission reductions of up to 80% and net climate neutrality, the efficiency of natural CO₂ sequestration will need to be increased (through selecting vegetation and increasing areas of blue-green infrastructure) and consideration will need to be given to geological sequestration, the application of which is going to depend on the emergence of new, more efficient, and cheaper technologies. The last resort will be the purchase of carbon credits - certificates confirming the reduction of greenhouse gases by investing in an environmental project, if possible located in Poland. However, the issue of purchasing carbon credits must be analysed by the city's legal and accounting services to ensure that they comply with the regulations governing local government.

## Developing the Action Plan and following steps of work

The Action Plan was developed on the basis of the results of the Economic Model, the actions planned in the Green Vision for Warsaw and stakeholder consultations. The consultations took place in terms of the Transition Team, which consisted of an internal team (representatives of selected cells and units of the City of Warsaw) and an external team (city stakeholders). Developing the document was preceded by consultations and workshops with stakeholders, as well as
0

Warsaw

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

workshops and meetings between cities participating in the Mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 as well as representatives of ministries key to implementing the climate policy in Poland within the National Cooperation Platform. The actions described therein are reflected in the Investment Plan and form the basis for defining the City's and stakeholders' Commitments.

The Climate Policy Department, operating within the Air Protection and Climate Policy Department of the City of Warsaw, is responsible for coordinating the process and drafting the document.

Submitting the Climate City Contract for evaluation will not stop the work on its evaluation and implementation. We intend to continue to meet with representatives of the Government of the Republic of Poland (key ministries for implementing the CCC) in order to identify barriers, challenges, and new opportunities, with a particular focus on raising funding for activities as well as removing infrastructural and legislative barriers, as part of the National Cooperation Platform. In Q4 2024, we are planning the first meetings aiming at acquiring more city stakeholders into the contract and carrying out workshops with stakeholders (internal and external) to look for links and synergies between the actions described in the Action Plan.

In the first quarter of 2025, we plan to organise a meeting of the Internal Transition Team, made up of city officials, employees of city companies, representatives of districts, to jointly analyse the measures contained in the Climate City Contract in terms of gaps and opportunities, and to consider whether additional analyses and studies will be needed concerning its assumptions and the manner in which it is implemented. The next step will be to consult the conclusions of the above-mentioned meetings within the External Transition Team, composed additionally of city stakeholders (contract signatories and other interested representatives of business, science, civil society, public institutions), and to obtain more concrete (at the operational level) commitments from stakeholders concerning actions supporting the implementation of the CCC.

The conclusions of the meetings will be discussed within the Climate Team already functioning within the city and communicated.

We are also planning the following actions:

external evaluation (ex-ante) of the coherence of the Climate City Contract with other municipal documents defining or influencing the city's climate policy,
monitoring the implementation of the CCC every 6 months, following a positive evaluation of the document,
annual internal evaluation (mid-term) and, after three years, an external evaluation, concerning the relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency of the planned activities.

Conclusions of the monitoring and evaluation activities will be discussed annually in terms of a Programme Board consisting of the entire Transition Team, with the participation of representatives of the managers of the districts implementing the climate contract and the district councils, representatives of the government and central institutions, representatives of the regional authorities, with the possibility of residents' participation.

The results of the monitoring and evaluation of the Climate City Contract will be presented to the Climate Team. The Team will also be addressed with key implementation findings and needs to support the implementation of activities or adjustments to activities at the strategic level (including updates to the CCC). The team will issue recommendations to the Board of the City of Warsaw
1

concerning possible CCC adjustments, including additional resources or actions to facilitate, streamline contract implementation, and deal with identified barriers.

Depending on the nature of the recommended decisions or the resources needed for mobilisation, decisions will be taken by the Board of the City of Warsaw, in agreement with the management boards of the mission districts, the Warsaw City Council, or the mission district councils, in accordance with their competences.

The entire management process is described later in this document.

# Key Stakeholders

Warsaw is strongly dependent on external factors in its climate neutrality efforts, including the pace of transition away from fossil energy sources at the national level, and on the actions of the private sector and non-local government institutions. Key stakeholders for achieving the objectives of the Climate City Contract are:

State-owned energy companies (energy producers) and energy distributors. The rate of decarbonisation of the CHP plants supplying the city with energy to a very large extent is decisive in terms of the rate of decarbonising the entire city. Warsaw's power grid is outdated and in need of modernisation, and requires investment in modern energy transmission management systems and energy storage. The absorption capacity of the grid depends, to a large extent, on the profitability of investing in renewable energy sources in the city. Moreover, the availability of certified green energy to be sourced from the grid now depends, almost entirely, on the policies of energy distributors. Therefore, companies such as Veolia Energia Warszawa, PGNiG Termika, or Stoen Operator are key stakeholders here.

The Government of the Republic of Poland and relevant ministries. Cooperation with central authorities is critical for the success of the Climate City Contracts. The actions of cities are highly dependent on the government's funding policy for local government, the availability of external funds for the transformation, the legislative framework, national energy, and climate policy. The Treasury is also a major shareholder in energy companies. The key ministries for implementing the Climate City Contract are the Ministry of Climate and Environment (in terms of coordinating the CCC with the national climate policy), the Ministry of Infrastructure (in the area of solutions related to construction and transport), and the Ministry of Funds and Regional Policy (in the area of financial support programmes). Currently, cooperation between mission cities and representatives of the central administration is actively developing in terms of the National Cooperation Platform, the aim of which is to discuss ways of the needed support (legislative, financial, technical, etc.) and the necessary interventions at the national level, enabling the CCC to be implemented and systemic barriers to be eliminated. In 2023, discussions between the Polish Mission Cities and ministries, coordinated by the Ministry of Climate and Environment, were initiated with the aim of establishing cooperation to support cities in their quest for climate neutrality. A series of multi-stakeholder meetings involving cities and representatives of several key ministries responsible for the sectors of climate, environment, domestic and foreign funds, development, technology, innovation, infrastructure, energy, etc. began in 2024. Barriers, including legislative, organisational, technical, and financial ones, were discussed during these discussions. A process has been initiated to involve the government side in the Climate City Contracts as a signatory.

costs, so securing adequate funding for local authorities from external sources plays a key role here.

The science sector - reducing the demand for primary energy requires a continuous search for and implementation of innovative solutions in the form of: ways to reduce consumption, energy recovery methods, ways to use waste energy, efficient storage of surplus energy. Therefore, cooperation with universities and scientific institutions in this field, but also in monitoring projects, climate diagnoses and scenarios, as well as social processes, is very important. Involving local communities in climate action, building commitment and ownership, supporting behavioural change, and developing a framework for working with local authorities is crucial to the success of the transition process.
Manufacturing, trade, and service companies - are key players for several reasons: they consume a large amount of energy and have a high potential for reducing energy consumption and using waste energy. Specialised companies - operators of vehicle charging stations as well as companies with large vehicle fleets can have an impact on developing electromobility. The companies also have properties in the mission districts that can be used in terms of efforts to invest in RES, increase energy efficiency, and develop blue-green infrastructure.
Municipal companies and units, including districts. These are the entities responsible for expanding pedestrian infrastructure, cycling and the public transport network, as well as investments in blue-green infrastructure in urban areas. The municipal units and companies constitute also the administrators of the land where much of the transformation work will be carried out. The districts are also in direct contact with residents and a valuable source of information about the situation of the vulnerable and excluded groups they work with on a daily basis.
Construction and renovation companies as well as cooperatives and housing associations. Entities operating in the construction industry and building administrators have a significant impact on developing and implementing new energy standards in new and modernised buildings. Without their commitment it will be difficult to carry out effective activities in this area.
Residents. Because the planned measures will be implemented largely with public money and their effects will affect the quality of life of the residents, they must be involved in the entire process and accept the implemented measures. In particular, they must be consulted on manners of developing public areas, on issues of reducing car traffic and changing transport habits, on measures for increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, on issues of a fair energy transition, and on the protection of vulnerable groups. Residents who know their districts, their problems, and their needs can constitute the source of many important initiatives and ideas to support the implementation of the CCC.

# 2 Part A - Current status of climate action

As Poland's largest city and its administrative capital, Warsaw is aware of its significant role in striving for climate neutrality. The city is home to more than  $5\%$  of the country's population (according to the Central Statistical Office for 2022), and an additional  $1\%$  are its users - which amounts to approx. 2

million people functioning in the Warsaw area every day. The largest central offices, institutions, headquarters of many national and international companies, as well as institutions are located here. Therefore, the city has a significant share of national greenhouse gas emissions and, as the capital, a major opinion-forming role.

Therefore, Warsaw wants to play a leading role in the region and in the country in striving for climate neutrality, to implement, test, and replicate new solutions and to set trends for other cities in Poland and Europe.

Warsaw has been pursuing a consistent climate policy for many years through the following measures:

2007 r. - Warsaw joined the C40 Cities association, an organisation bringing together the world's metropolises working together on climate protection. Warsaw is a member of five working groups and a signatory to several agreements and declarations, the implementation of which has had a very positive impact on adaptation and mitigation measures and the quality of life and health of the population.
2009 - joining the European Commission's initiative Covenant of Mayors - 31 August 2021 the Warsaw City Council has adopted Position No. 37 on a new climate declaration as part of the international initiative "Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy". It obliges the Capital City of Warsaw to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the goal of achieving climate neutrality in 2050, to increase the city's resilience and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change, and to combat fuel poverty as one of the key actions to ensure a just transition.
2009 - Adopting the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) - the first document of a strategic nature that set out the principles for developing urban transport in a sustainable manner (on 16 November 2023, the Warsaw City Council adopted the new Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan for the Warsaw metropolitan area - SUMP).
2011 - Adopting the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) - aimed at reducing the city's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere by, among other things, increasing energy production from renewable sources.
2016 - Adopting the Environmental Protection Programme (updated in 2021. A new programme up to 2030 is currently under development), indicating actions aimed at improving the quality of life in the city through sustainable development, preserving the significant values of the natural environment, improving its condition, improving spatial order, and developing environmental infrastructure (equipment, systems, as well as activities aimed at protecting and improving the environment), protecting the climate, and adapting the city to its changes.
2018 - Adopting the #Warsaw2030 Development Strategy - a general document that defines the city's vision, strategic and operational goals. Work is currently underway to update the document, including making climate protection issues (mitigation and adaptation) a higher priority in the city's strategic objectives.
2019 - Adopting the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the Capital City of Warsaw by 2030 with a perspective to 2050. Municipal Plan, constituting the policy of Warsaw in terms of taking action to prevent and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. The document describes the key threats resulting from climate change and the associated risk areas for Warsaw and its residents, as well as indicating courses of action through which the City will protect itself against the negative effects of climate change-related phenomena.
2019 - Establishing the Air Protection and Climate Policy Department (BOPiPK), whose tasks include coordinating the city's climate policy, initiating actions and processes on climate change mitigation and adaptation.
2017 - one of the largest municipal companies Miejskie Przedsiębiorstwo Wodociągów i Kanalizacji signed the "Charter of Ecological Responsibility of Entrepreneurs and Employers in Poland", whose signatories-initiators are 33 Polish companies and organisations. The document constitutes a voluntary, open initiative including declarations of concrete actions for climate neutrality, environmental education, and the promotion of a circular economy. The company is
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

consistently implementing decarbonisation measures by investing in renewable energy, energy recovery, and circular economy. In 2023, the company was already one-third self-sufficient in terms of energy.

2020 - carrying out a citizens' panel called: the Warsaw Climate Panel. The aim of the panel was to enable the citizens of Warsaw to participate in the decision-making process concerning increasing the energy efficiency of Warsaw and the share of renewable energy sources in the city's energy balance. A group of randomly selected 90 residents, representative for the city's social structure in terms of age, gender and education, came up with 49 recommendations, which are being implemented by Warsaw on the basis of the Mayor's commitment.
2023 - Adopting the Green Vision for Warsaw - a document describing how the city can achieve climate neutrality by 2050. It is a comprehensive Green City &amp; Climate Action Plan. It builds on the city's declared levels of greenhouse gas emission reductions and plans to strive for climate neutrality and sustainable development goals, while promoting social inclusion.
2022 - application to the European Commission's Mission 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities 2030 initiative and to the Pilot Cities Programme within the Mission 100 Cities, receiving a grant and joining the NEEST - Climate Neutral and Environmentally Sustainable Urban Areas project consortium.
2023 - initiating works on the General Plan, which will divide the city into planning zones with specific functional profiles for which basic land use parameters will be defined. Due to legislative changes in Poland, the plan will replace the hitherto binding Study of Conditions and Directions for the Spatial Development of Warsaw, which sets the directions for the city's development.
2023 - establishing the Climate Team chaired by the Mayor of Warsaw - an interdisciplinary team composed of heads of units of the City of Warsaw and representatives of other municipal entities with the greatest impact on implementing the city's climate policy. The task of the team is to coordinate the implementation of projects and processes in the area of mitigation and adaptation, which are systemic and interdisciplinary in nature.
2023 - accessing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development project: Enhancing City-level Climate Governance: Implementation Plan and Initial Climate Risk Disclosure for the City of Warsaw, which aims to build awareness and competence in the city's departments and organisational units regarding a better understanding of climate change risks and potential opportunities, to help develop climate proofing processes for city investments and to support the identification of an effective governance model to integrate climate issues into key city management and planning processes (climate governance).
Since 2007, Warsaw has been carrying out a GHG inventory in 2-year cycles. Since 2018, the inventory is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the "GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard". The most recent inventory was carried out in 2023 and includes data concerning 2022 emissions.

# 2.1 Module A-1 Baseline greenhouse gas emissions inventory

## Baseline greenhouse gas inventory

Warsaw is developing a greenhouse gas emissions inventory on a biennial basis. It consists of collecting data and counting emissions based on an accepted methodology in line with an international standard for counting greenhouse gas emissions called The Global Protocol for Community Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC). All emissions are calculated for three main sectors: stationary energy, transport, and waste. The inventory is in accordance with the requirements of the C40 organisation, by which it is also verified, and constitutes one of the elements of the annual report submitted to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) platform of the Covenant of Mayors in which Warsaw participates. The inventory takes advantage of various types of data obtained from a number of departments and organisational units of the City of Warsaw and eternal entities such as energy companies, municipal companies, technology companies, and also from national databases (e.g. National Centre for Emissions Management, Central Statistical Office). All calculations are collected in the CIRIS tabulation tool, which constitutes the international benchmark application for analysing this data. The results obtained are consulted with technical experts from C40 and form the basis for ensuring that the conditions for the city's participation in the organisation are compatible.

Warsaw has all the data necessary to develop a greenhouse gas emissions inventory, both for the districts covered by the Climate City Contract and for the city as a whole, including at the level of each district. The following gases are analysed: carbon dioxide - $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, methane - CH4, and nitrous oxide - N2O.

The inventory presents the level of greenhouse gas emissions for a given year for the three main sectors:

stationary energy, i.e. emissions associated with the consumption of electricity and heat in buildings, machinery and installations, as well as fugitive emissions from the gas network,
transport, i.e. emissions caused by the movement of cars, trains, buses, trams, metros and aircraft moving within the city's administrative area,
waste, i.e. emissions associated with the treatment of solid waste and wastewater generated within the city.

The agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) sectors were not included in each of the GHG inventories carried out.

The baseline GHG emission inventory for Warsaw was carried out for the year 2018 and, on its basis, an economic model (an integrated tool supporting the climate transition planning process, enabling data-driven strategic decision-making) was developed for the Climate City Contract. The following GHG inventory results were obtained for the 3 sectors:

Stationary energy - 9,380,016 tCO2e

Transport - 3,036,454 tCO2e

Waste - 61,404 tCO2e

The total emissions for the entire area of the City of Warsaw amounted to: 12,477,873 tCO2e.

The following GHG inventories carried out in 2020 and 2022 showed the dynamics of change for each of the studied sectors, which are included in the graph below:

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)
Figure 5
Dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions from the area of Warsaw in the years 2018-2022

The increase or lack of reduction in 2022 is, in our opinion, temporary and related to the war in Ukraine, as a result of which Poland, including Warsaw, has become an aid and logistics hub, thereby increasing the number of city users (migrants from Ukraine and people involved in aid to Ukraine) by several hundred thousand. An economic model was also developed for two Warsaw districts, which indicates the following sectoral emissions:

Stationary energy - 1,502,090 tCO $_2$ e

Transport - 372,725 tCO $_2$ e

Waste - 2023 tCO $_2$ e

The total emissions for the area of the two districts amounted to: 1,883,243 tCO $_2$ e.

According to calculations of the economic model, in order to achieve the reduction goals of the Climate City Contract, it will be necessary to reduce CO2 emissions at 1,599,000 tCO $_2$ e, of which concerning transport - 190,000 tCO $_2$ e, buildings and heating - 517,000 tCO $_2$ e, electricity - 881,000 tCO $_2$ e, waste - 6,000 tCO $_2$ e and other sectors - 6,000 tCO $_2$ e.

The greenhouse gas emissions inventory carried out in 2022 showed the following contribution by sector to the city's total emissions:

nearly three quarters of Warsaw's greenhouse gas emissions result from the production and consumption of electricity and heat by buildings.
a quarter of the emissions are related to transport - primarily road and to a lesser extent rail, water, and air.
approximately one % of emissions result from the treatment of waste generated within the city.

Figure 6
Emissions of greenhouse gasses from the area of Warsaw in 2022

As the inventory shows, the greatest potential for emission reductions is in the stationary energy sector and the transport sector. Consequently, the Climate City Contract places the greatest emphasis on actions from these sectors. The waste sector has a minimal impact on the city's carbon footprint and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  reduction potential.

The 2018 baseline GHG emissions inventory forms the basis for further analyses of reduction needs within the city. Based on its results, a level of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  reduction (reduction effect) has been assigned to each measure described in the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP), providing a reference point for monitoring the progress of reduction measures implemented in the city, in various sectors.

# Methodology for calculating emissions for the activities described in the Action Plan

All emission reduction calculations have been prepared based on:

the assumptions of the Green Vision for Warsaw and its reduction goals,
results of the Economic Model for Warsaw,
results of the 2018 greenhouse gas emissions inventory for Warsaw for electricity, heat, transport, waste
results of the heat source inventory for Warsaw,
assumptions of the Warsaw Green Building Standard,
analyses of the Public Roads Authority in Warsaw in terms of installing city lighting,
the city's database systems: the Central Land, Building, and Premises Register, the Building and Premises Inventory and Management System.
climate change adaptation strategy for Warsaw up to 2030 with a perspective for 2050, the Municipal Adaptation Plan, the Study of Conditions and Directions for Spatial Development of Warsaw.
studies and articles from online sources concerning estimating  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  reductions.

available for the districts covered by the Climate City Contract, an indicator based on the percentage share of Ursynów and Praga-Południe (as of 2022) in the total population of Warsaw was used for the calculations. Based on this share, the proportions of emissions per district were calculated. These are as follows: Praga-Południe - 186,623, representing 10% of Warsaw's population, and Ursynów - 151,345, representing 8% of Warsaw's population. In the performed calculations these figures are taken collectively, giving a total of 337,968 representing 18% of the city's total population (the total population of Warsaw as of 2022 was 1,862,000 according to the Central Statistical Office).

Note: CO₂ reduction calculations have been prepared on the basis of the best available knowledge obtained by the persons preparing the document during its development. Due to the complexity of the measures described in the Climate City Contract and the lack of publicly available, proven methodologies for estimating emission reductions for specific sectoral measures, the calculations will need to be further verified and updated at a later stage.

Calculating CO₂ emission reductions for each of the measures described in point B.2.2 has been prepared based on the most up-to-date information available, including the results of the 2018, 2020 and 2022 GHG inventories and available methodologies for counting CO₂ emissions for each sector. The resulting total CO₂ reduction is close to the estimate of the Economic Model.

For the selected sectors: buildings and heating as well as energy, the calculated values are inconsistent with the Economic Model. This is due to the nature of the Economic Model, which estimated values based on the assumptions entered into it, some of which were based on data obtained from the city and some on averaged indicators. Therefore, its results can be considered as a more large-scale approximation, which was very useful at the start of the work on the Climate City Contract. Whereas, real data was used to calculate the emission reductions for each measure, which enabled a more precise result. These discrepancies will continue to be analysed before the following iteration of the Climate City Contract which will be carried out in the following months.

In addition, the values estimated by the Economic Model have been entered for the AFOLU/IPPU sectors in Table A.1.3. While the greenhouse gas emissions inventory that Warsaw carries out every two years involves calculating the carbon footprint at the Basic level, thus excluding these two sectors. It also does not include the calculation of emissions of gases such as SF6, HFCs, PFCs, or NF3, so these cannot be counted for individual activities. All activities described in detail under the Green Infrastructure and Nature-Based Solutions have been treated as those that can be undertaken under the Agriculture, Forestry, and Land Use (AFOLU) sector.

### Local level

**Assumptions to the plan for supply of heat, electricity, and gas fuels for Warsaw (being updated)**

**Territorial scope:** local

**Significance:** Document, adopted on 27 August 2020 by a resolution of the Warsaw City Council No. XXXV/1074/2020, sets out changes to the operation of the energy system in the city, describing the assumptions and possibilities for transforming it into a less carbon-intensive system.

**Description:** the document constitutes a strategic act which is based on the provisions of the Energy Law. It is drawn up for at least 15 years and is subject to at least three-yearly updates. Its purpose is to analyse and assess the forecast changes in demand for heat, electricity, and gaseous fuel, as well as to assess the level of energy security in the municipality and make suggestions for measures to improve it.

The document constitutes a description of all energy systems and energy demand projections. At the same time, energy companies are obliged to prepare their own development plans. If the assumptions are not in line with the companies' development plans, the Mayor of Warsaw prepares heat, electricity, and gas supply plans for individual areas for which the energy companies do not provide supply.

Assumptions to the plan for supply of heat, electricity, and gas fuels for Warsaw constitute a tool for implementing the law when shaping energy management and energy planning in the city. The document is intended to serve energy companies operating in and on behalf of Warsaw, as well as those which may undertake such activities in the field of energy management, to prepare or verify their development plans with respect to, inter alia, satisfaction of the City's present and future demand for energy and gaseous fuels, as well as forecasts concerning the state of security of energy and fuel supply and the volume of energy production in compliance with the provisions of the Energy Law Act, Article 16, item 12, point 2, on an obligatory or optional basis.

The assumptions constitute the basis for planning the development of energy and gas fuel supply systems for the organisational units of Warsaw taking into account, among other things, the requirements of sustainable development, environmental and climate protection as well as equal competition and the need to fulfil international obligations in accordance with the obligation set out in the Energy Law.

In the Assumptions to the plan of supply of heat, electricity, and gaseous fuels for Warsaw, an assessment was made concerning the current state and projected changes in demand as well as its potential to cover demand for heat, electricity and gaseous fuels in the city, based on calculated energy balances and descriptions of the functioning of the electricity, heat, and gas network systems. The balances take into account the energy demand (excluding transport) of all entities operating on the territory of the City of Warsaw and from outside the city which supply Warsaw.

# Study of Conditions and Directions of Spatial Development of Warsaw (replaced by the currently developed so-called General Plan)

Territorial scope: local

Significance: the study presents the conditions and directions for spatial development. These are binding for local development plans.

Description: The city has drafted a new Study for Warsaw as a vision for the entire city. The study fulfilled three basic functions: it defined the assumptions of the local spatial development policy; it coordinated the spatial assumptions of the city-wide scale at the level of drawing up local spatial development plans; it integrated the individual elements that make up the urban ecosystem. The draft study included many pro-climate solutions, such as the protection of natural resources, the development of a blue-green infrastructure system, the development of sustainable mobility, climate change adaptation and mitigation, the development of technical infrastructure in terms of creating conditions for the introduction, of solutions to support the process of achieving climate neutrality. However, due to changes in the Spatial Planning and Development Act, the municipalities' spatial planning studies will cease to apply from 2026 and their role will be taken over by the municipal development strategy and the municipal general plan. Therefore, Warsaw's authorities have decided to suspend work concerning the new study in favour of preparing a master plan. Most of the materials that have been prepared so far for the study will be used. The currently developed master plan will not set the direction of the city's development. Instead, it will divide the city into planning zones with specific functional profiles for which basic land-use parameters will be defined.

The aim of the panel was to enable the citizens of Warsaw to participate in the decision-making process concerning increasing the energy efficiency of Warsaw and the share of renewable energy sources in the city's energy balance. A group of randomly selected 90 residents, representative for the city's social structure in terms of age, gender and education, came up with 49 recommendations, which are being implemented by Warsaw on the basis of the Mayor's commitment.

# Green Vision for Warsaw - Green City and Climate Action Plan

Territorial scope: local

Significance: An action plan, in the style of a comprehensive "road map" for a green city and climate. The Green Vision for Warsaw supports implementing climate and greenhouse gas reduction targets contained in other strategic documents of the city. The study establishes new climate targets for Warsaw. It guides the city's development, while pointing to specific measures whose implementation will bring it closer to achieving climate neutrality.

Description: The Green Vision of Warsaw is an action plan containing reduction scenarios in the perspective up to 2030 and up to 2050, adopted by Resolution No. LXXX/2648/2023 of the Warsaw City Council of 20 April 2023. The scenarios developed during the work on this document support the implementation of the objectives included in the #Warsaw 2030 Strategy and the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy of Warsaw by 2030 with a perspective to 2050. It combines two methodologies used around the world: the Green City Action Plan, developed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Climate Action Plan, developed by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. Combining these two methodologies allowed producing a document that is comprehensively based on verified data. Creating the Green Vision of Warsaw was preceded by a thorough analysis of the state of the city (based on 122 indicators) in terms of the pressures exerted by various areas of the city's functioning on the environment and climate, the state of the natural environment and the city's responses to environmental and climate risks to date. In accordance with the Green Vision for Warsaw, Warsaw has declared targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the entire city: 40% by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality no later than 2050. The document is designed so that both the long-term goals and the accompanying

Description: The SUMP for the Warsaw metropolitan area aims to improve the mobility of residents. It will make it possible to make better use of the existing infrastructure in the cities, municipalities, and counties of the metropolis, to plan the expansion of the transport system and maintain its high quality, to coordinate investments. Thanks to the SUMP it will be possible to more efficiently plan a people-friendly space and ensure greater comfort and safety for all traffic participants. The sustainable urban mobility plan is intended to contribute to reducing the negative environmental impacts of transport, such as air pollution, noise and greenhouse gas emissions. A condition for these changes consists in increasing the role of environmentally friendly modes of transport, which include: public, cycling, and walking transport, as well as low-emission transport. Implementing the plan means also greater safety for all road users: drivers, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists, and people with disabilities. Sustainable mobility means both good roads, even pavements taking into account the comfort of all users (including low kerbs) and bicycle paths, as well as improving access to public transport for as many residents as possible. All of these elements are intended to help improve the quality of life for residents and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of passenger and freight transport.

SUMP includes specific objectives aimed at reducing the negative impact of transport on people and the environment. One of its horizontal objectives (Horizontal Objective II) consists in reducing the environmental and climate impact of transport: "aiming for climate neutrality no later than in 2050" points to the need to reduce emissions from transport in the MW by nearly half already in 2030 (compared to 2019 levels) and a decrease of at least two-thirds thereafter compared to 2030 values.

Description: this regulation establishes a management mechanism to achieve the 2030 targets and objectives of the energy union and in the long term, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.

Scope: The energy union should encompass five dimensions: energy security, the internal energy market, energy efficiency, decarbonisation, as well as research, innovation, and competitiveness

The aim of a stable energy union pursuing an ambitious climate policy is to provide EU consumers - including households and businesses - with a secure, sustainable, competitive, and affordable energy supply and to stimulate research and innovation by attracting investment.

Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU with regard to corporate sustainability reporting.

Territorial scope: EU

Significance: it imposes an obligation on companies to report annually according to common European sustainability reporting standards.

Description: Under the Regulation, all large entities as well as small and medium-sized listed companies will provide information on environmental, social and human rights issues and corporate governance in their management report.

The provisions of the Regulation provide for a three-stage timetable concerning the application of the new obligations by individuals. Initially, the information will be presented (for the financial year 2024) by the largest entities that already report so-called non-financial information under the Accounting Act. These are large public interest entities with more than 500 employees. A year later, the first reports will be presented by the other major entities. Small and medium-sized listed companies will report for the first time for the 2026 financial year.

## Assessment of plans, policies, and strategies

Issues concerning sustainability and climate policy are complex, systemic, interdisciplinary, and affect a great number of areas of the society's functioning. Therefore, they are regulated by a great number of separate pieces of legislation, created for different areas of regulation (spatial policy, buildings, energy, transport, water relations, finance, environmental policy, etc.) as well as strategy and policy documents. These acts and documents are not always consistent with each other - during development they often focus on the specifics of a dedicated thematic area. These inconsistencies are evident at local as well as the regional, national, and European level.

Warsaw is currently in the process of reviewing and aligning policies, regulations and documents affecting climate policy and sustainable development policy. The first step towards this consisted in

developing a roadmap describing how the manner in which the city would achieve climate neutrality and sustainability measures - the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP). The policies and documents of a local nature listed in this section of the Action Plan are or will be amended in terms of consistency and compatibility with the Green Vision for Warsaw and the Climate City Contract.

There is also a lack of consistency in terms of regulations and policies at the national level, setting and supporting the achievement of reduction targets. This is evidenced by European Commission Recommendation 2024/608 of 18 December 2023. on the coherence of Poland's measures with the EU's climate neutrality target and with ensuring progress in adapting to climate change, which recommends, inter alia, establishing an appropriate legal framework for climate change adaptation policies and related actions, which recommends, inter alia: intensifying mitigation efforts by making measurable progress in implementing existing and planned strategies, as well as considering additional urgent measures to align assumed and planned greenhouse gas emission reductions with the climate neutrality target.

Local operation in cities needs to be supported by regulations at the national and regional level, which enable more effective protection of green areas and water resources from urbanisation pressures (regulations in spatial policy, building law, environmental law), implementation of building efficiency standards (building law and other building regulations), facilitate investment in renewable energy sources (RES Act and strategy documents), provide incentives for rapid energy decarbonisation (energy law and other energy regulations), and provide incentives for rapid energy decarbonisation (energy law and other energy regulations). support the development of low-emission transport and create the frameworks for a circular economy.

National and European regulations and policies are highly fragmented and scattered. They require a more coherent form and simplification, and perhaps codification, understood as a process of bringing together a large set of laws, strategies and policies into a single, structured set that will assume:

greater coordination of mitigation and adaptation activities,
holistic and systemic approach to mitigation, adaptation and GOZ in place of fragmented, non-seeing actions, policies,
integration of activities at various levels (EU, supranational, national, regional, local) concerning planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating actions,
integration and coordination of policies and actions between sectors (energy, buildings, BZI, transport) - an integrated approach.

Greater integration of legal frameworks and policies will make it easier to carry out integrated, systemic activities, which will make more efficient use of resources and increase their effectiveness through synergies.

A detailed analysis of individual policies and legislation as well as their individual impacts on the actions described in the Climate City Contract requires further work, which will be addressed in subsequent iterations of the Action Plan.

# Main barriers and gaps identified in the city.

High costs and unknown scale of energy efficiency needs for buildings. Three quarters of the city's emissions form from the production of energy (electricity and heat) and its consumption by buildings. According to the results of the latest GHG inventory (for 2022), Warsaw's dominant sector, in terms of emissions, consists in stationary energy (electricity and heat production and consumption by buildings), which accounts for 73% of the city's total emissions. The number of municipal buildings in need of deep thermal modernisation is approx. 1200 public utility buildings (including 237 listed historical buildings) and 1197 single-family and multi-family residential buildings (including 607 listed historical buildings). The cost of such thermal modernisation has been estimated in the Green Vision for Warsaw at more than PLN 5 billion (an amount estimated before inflation due to the war in Ukraine and should now be increased by approx. 20%). In addition, there are buildings that do not belong to the city. According to the Land and Building

O

Register, there are more than 180,000 buildings of various uses in Warsaw. The condition and energy performance of most of them is unknown. In Poland, the Integrated Low Emission Reduction System (ZONE), of which the Central Emission Inventory for Buildings (CEEB) is a part, has recently been implemented, but it does not yet have enough data to estimate the scale of thermal modernisation needs for all buildings in the city. The biggest challenges to climate transformation in our assessment are: buildings with unregulated ownership, buildings in a poor state of repair, buildings listed on the historic register or under conservation protection. In the two districts covered by the Climate City Contract, the number of total buildings is similar, with a very large difference in the number of urban buildings: Praga-Południe approx. 12,000 buildings (of which 1,392 are municipal), Ursynów approx. 11,000 (including 30 municipal). Thermal modernisation of buildings is crucial for achieving the climate neutrality of Warsaw. All available analyses say that it is impossible to produce as much heat energy from renewable sources as is currently consumed by buildings in Warsaw.

Actions to be taken:

a. completing building data in the Integrated Low Emission Reduction System (ZONE),
b. carrying out a thermal imaging survey of buildings in the mission districts,
c. launching (at national and EU level) systemic programmes of financial support for the deep thermal modernisation of buildings and an advisory system to make the programmes easier to use and more accessible.

Limitations in developing blue-green infrastructure (BZI). The city has a high potential for developing the BZI, but is increasingly facing challenges such as: a lack of sites for new tree planting (mainly through conflicts with underground infrastructure), a complicated land ownership structure (open areas, valuable in terms of nature, are often outside the city's ownership and not protected against development), urbanisation pressure from private investors for more land, increasingly difficult habitat conditions for plants in the city (heat waves, droughts, frosts, emergence of new pests, diseases and invasive species), multiple entities responsible for maintaining the city's green spaces.

Actions to be taken:

a. legislative changes at the national level enabling local authorities to protect valuable areas more effectively against urbanisation pressures and introducing quality standards for investors concerning the development of the surroundings of linear and cubic investments (e.g. concerning the quality of biologically active surface or the management of rainwater on a plot),
b. implementing the Warsaw Green Building Standard currently being developed for new and modernised municipal buildings, an important element of which is the requirement to apply the Warsaw Green Management Standards,
c. introducing uniform standards for developing and maintaining green spaces for all those responsible for maintaining urban green spaces,
d. selecting plant species with increased resistance to heat, drought, and other hazards.

Lack of a developed network of local and district centres. A large proportion of housing estates do not have sufficiently developed service centres, forcing residents of these areas to

C

meet many of their needs in the centre of the capital. This results in more pressure on the public transport network and increased traffic within the city.

**Actions to be taken:**

a. developing a feasibility study and a development plan for the mission districts in terms of the 15-minute city concept (the concept assumes that most daily needs can be met within a 15-minute walking distance).

**Dependence on the National Grid (KSE) and the national energy mix.** Warsaw has very limited impact on the sources of power generation, which are regulated at national level. There are two energy companies operating within the city, which supply 80% of the city's heating needs, are independent of the city, and are not obliged to consult their development plans with the local authority. During the winter period, the city's demand is covered by 63% from CHP sources at Siekierki CHP Plant and Žeráń CHP Plant. During the summer, the Warsaw electricity system requires support from the KSE at a level of approximately 80%.

The heating sector in Warsaw is based on heat production from fossil fuels, coal, and natural gas, with a residual use of biomass. Whereas, the current national energy mix is based on fossil fuels. The main fuel is coal. For example, in 2022, 66.2% of the country's heat production came from coal and almost 16% from other fossil fuels: natural gas and fuel oil (Energy Regulatory Office - Report: Thermal power industry in numbers - 2022),

**Actions to be taken:**

a. decarbonisation and modernisation of the national energy system,

b. creating a local strategic partnership between the city and the main energy producers and suppliers in the city in order to agree on joint decarbonisation measures, including: increasing energy production from non-fossil sources (e.g. biogas), reducing energy losses on transmission networks and distribution lines, using waste energy (from industrial processes, refrigeration processes, undergrounds, server rooms), storing energy, increasing the offer of certified green energy sales, seeking new sources of energy supply.

**Limited direct impact on the city's greenhouse gas emissions.** The GHG inventory in Warsaw, for the years 2018, 2020, 2022, shows that the share of urban units in the emissions of the entire of Warsaw oscillated at approximately 7.4% (concerns Scope 1 and 2 emissions). This means that entities over which the city has no direct influence are responsible for the majority of emissions.

a. involving the widest possible range of urban stakeholders in climate neutrality efforts,

b. launching (at national and EU level), a broad, attractive programme of incentives (subsidies, discounts) for residents, businesses, and other municipal entities encouraging action to reduce greenhouse gases in various sectors (energy efficiency of buildings, conversion to renewable energy sources, electromobility, etc.).

**Difficulties in using data.** Sources of data (environmental, energy, and other) are highly dispersed and are often held by external entities that are not obliged to provide them to the Office of the City of Warsaw. There is no integrated database to collect and process it quickly. This makes it difficult to carry out monitoring and evaluation processes concerning sustainability and emission reduction measures.

**Actions to be taken:**

#

a. completing building data in the Integrated Low Emission Reduction System (ZONE),
b. carrying out a thermal imaging survey of buildings in the mission districts,
c. launching (at national and EU level) systemic programmes of financial support for the deep thermal modernisation of buildings and an advisory system to make the programmes easier to use and more accessible.

Problems with using rainwater. Only a small proportion of rainwater is reused in the city, which affects the city's degree of adaptation to climate change. This is influenced by factors such as: the dispersion of responsibility for rainwater management for various entities (in particular, for management of rainwater infrastructure), a high degree of land sealing, especially in inner city districts, lack of legal provisions and a systemic solution to oblige investors to apply solutions ensuring retention and management of rainwater on investment sites, while at the same time there is a strong investment and urbanisation pressure on almost all areas, a low degree of implementing rainwater drainage solutions, lack of standards concerning retention and management of rainwater.

Actions to be taken:

a. implementing the Warsaw Green Building Standard currently being developed for new and modernised city buildings, an important element of which is the requirement to manage rainwater or snowmelt on site,
b. implementing legislation at national level obliging investors to take advantage of solutions to ensure retention and management of rainwater or snowmelt on investment sites,
c. intensifying efforts to unseal city-owned impervious surfaces in the districts covered by the Climate City Contract,
d. intensification of educational activities, using the "Warsaw Climate Change Adaptation Handbook" addressed to property owners, cooperatives, housing communities in the districts covered by the Climate City Contract.

System barriers to RES development. The development of renewable energy sources in cities faces many systemic barriers in Poland. These include formal and legal barriers such as: the lack of stable legal regulations and a long-term development strategy, which leads to investment uncertainty, the so-called "distance criterion" in the Wind Power Investment Act, which prevents windmills from being built in more densely built-up areas, the lack of legal possibilities to establish energy cooperatives in urban municipalities, the unfavourable billing of electricity supplied to the National Grid for prosumers. There are also infrastructural barriers, such as constraints for prosumers related to their ability to access connection capacities due to the lack of adequate infrastructure (especially in terms of transmission networks). Such barriers discourage or even prevent investment in RES. In the case of photovoltaics, they make it most profitable to produce for self-consumption at the point of generation and it is not profitable to produce surplus energy. In the case of wind energy, they prevent the construction of windmills in an urban or peri-urban area.

Actions to be taken:

a. legislative changes at the national level, including a reduction of the so-called "distance criterion" in the Wind Power Investment Act, allowing for establishing energy cooperatives in urban municipalities, a more favourable energy billing system for prosumers.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

b. the emergence of stable legal regulations and a long-term strategy for the development of renewable energy sources at national level.

Financial barriers. Systemic transformation requires a great amount of financial resources, which cannot be covered by local authorities. Therefore, the most costly changes have to be carried out using external funds: regional, central, EU, foreign, and private. Access to current funding programmes is severely limited by the dispersion of funding programmes, the complicated application procedure, and rigid nature of the procedures, the narrow scope of the programmes (they are targeted at specific activities, comprehensive transformation activities require the use of multiple programmes with different application and settlement rules), the lack of an adequate number of qualified staff at the City of Warsaw to process applications and implement projects, and, in particular, the statutory restrictions on local government indebtedness, limiting the use of loans.

Actions to be taken:

a. facilitating access to national and EU funding programmes by: simplifying application procedures, more comprehensive funding programmes and their modular design allowing flexible use of various programme options, launching a counselling system to support local authorities in the process of obtaining and accounting for grants, adapting funding programmes to the real needs and constraints found in EU member states.

b. increasing the level of private capital involvement in public investment in the city through the use of public-private partnerships (PPP), the Energy Service Company (ESCO) formula, or by setting up funds dedicated to various activities, e.g. Sustainable Energy Investment Fund - along the lines of the city's existing Green Fund.

The unknown scale of energy poverty. The scale of energy poverty is not precisely known and its proper diagnosis is not easy to carry out. This measure is still being analysed. Without a thorough knowledge of the nature and scale of the phenomenon, it will be difficult to create effective support programmes.

Key factors contributing to energy poverty are low energy efficiency in buildings, insufficient income to cover energy costs, and rising energy prices. It is estimated that in Poland, 12% of the population is affected by this phenomenon. In Warsaw, energy poverty is exacerbated by the higher cost of living and legal problems related to the status of property ownership, which hinder significant investment in building upgrades. Therefore, the level of energy poverty in the city reaches 15%. Of the districts implementing the Climate Climate Contract, the Praga-Południe district is particularly affected, with serious challenges due to outdated heating systems and reliance on expensive electric heating.

Initial analyses concerning the phenomenon of energy poverty have been carried out in Warsaw in terms of a project conducted by the Infrastructure Department of the City of Warsaw named The Sun4All, developed within the framework of the European Sun4All project - "Eurosolar for all: energy communities for a fair energy transition in Europe".

Actions to be taken:

a. performing a thorough analysis of the scale and specifics of energy poverty in Warsaw, starting with the districts covered by the Climate City Contract,

b. designing public policies (at national, regional and local level) so that they can alleviate energy poverty by improving the energy efficiency of buildings, promoting renewable

c. removing legal barriers at national level that restrict the development of energy communities,
d. developing targeted financial support programmes for low-income households,
e. expert support in obtaining funding, appropriate investment selection and matching energy community models are tailored to local conditions.

# A-3.3: Description or visualisation of the participatory model of climate neutrality of the city

The GHG inventory of Warsaw, for the years 2018, 2020, 2022, shows that the share of municipal units in the emissions of the entire Warsaw oscillated at approx.  $7.5\%$  (concerns emission scope 1 and 2). Therefore, a key factor for success in achieving the goal of the Climate City Contract is to involve the widest possible range of stakeholders.

In the process of implementing the CCC, we want to build on our previous good experiences, adding to them the experience and knowledge we have gained in the course of implementing the measures: from

our project partners, advisors, other cities, stakeholders, etc. We also want to extend the involvement of stakeholders and residents throughout the process.

In this regard we will take advantage of our extensive experience from past participatory and consultative processes. Warsaw has been involving residents and stakeholders in important decision-making processes for many years through:

Consulting residents and stakeholders on key plans and actions. Since 2010, 2353 public consultations have taken place in Warsaw. Current information concerning them can be found at the dedicated website (https://konsultacje.um.warszawa.pl)
Extensive consultation with residents and other stakeholders concerning documents programming the city's development and important projects affecting quality of life, such as: the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for Warsaw by 2030 with a perspective to 2050. The Municipal Adaptation Plan, Study of Conditions and Directions of Spatial Development of Warsaw, Clean Transport Zone, revitalisation programmes, Local Spatial Development Plans, etc.
Participation in developing the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP). We've invited a wide range of stakeholders who had a significant impact on the final character of the document: representatives of NGOs, science, and businesses. Experts from various fields and residents of the capital were also involved in the work. More than 20 working meetings and workshops for external stakeholders took place, as well as dozens of sessions for internal stakeholders - municipal units and units responsible for implementing individual measures. Approx. 300 people participated in them. Residents of Warsaw had also the opportunity to submit their comments on the document via a virtual platform.
Between 2020 and 2021, Warsaw organised the Warsaw Climate Panel, which was commissioned to NGOs selected in the course of a competition, and 90 residents selected at random (representative of the city's social structure in terms of age, gender, education, residence) decided on climate policy in the area of increasing Warsaw's energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy sources in the city's energy balance. The panellists developed and voted on 49 recommendations for Warsaw. The panel also included experts, representatives of NGOs and urban movements. Implementing the Panel's provisions is monitored by the Monitoring Team, which includes the social side.
For more than 10 years, Warsaw includes the institution of the Participatory budgeting, a process in which the residents of Warsaw decide what to spend part of the city budget on. They submit their ideas and then, by voting, select those to be implemented by the City of Warsaw.
For many years, the city has had a platform called Partnership for Climate, which brings together organisations and institutions representing a wide variety of backgrounds, including state and local government units, embassies, businesses, NGOs and institutions committed to nature conservation and building a sustainable city. Members of the platform share knowledge, experiences, and carry out joint projects.

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The selection of impact pathways is based on 3 sources: The Green Vision of Warsaw (GCAAP), developed based on data collected in terms of the State of the City Analysis (124 indicators of environmental pressure), based on the results of the greenhouse gas inventory (for 2018-2022) and based on the predictions of the economic model (an integrated tool supporting the climate transition planning process, enabling data-driven strategic decision-making). We've put emphasis on measures that will bring the most tangible effects in the form of a quick reduction of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ .

According to the results of the latest GHG inventory (for 2022), Warsaw's dominant sector, in terms of emissions, consists in stationary energy (electricity and heat production and consumption by buildings), which accounts for  $73\%$  of the city's total emissions. Another key sector is transport, which accounts for  $26\%$  of Warsaw's emissions.

The above results in the strategic, systemic priorities for achieving the 2030 reduction target by the mission districts that have been outlined in the Commitments. They are:

Changing the energy mix structure - replacing fossil energy sources in the area of electricity and heat production and distribution with low-carbon renewable sources.
Reducing the need for heat and electricity from fossil sources.
Increasing the level of electrifying public transport and reducing the scale of individual car transport.
Developing blue-green infrastructure.

All priorities are reflected in the impact pathways. The three initial priorities concern the most effective manners of influencing the reduction of emission levels in the specific situation of Warsaw. Priority 4 is less relevant in terms of direct impact on emission reductions. However, maintaining and developing blue-green infrastructure is very important both in terms of sequestering surplus carbon, as well as adaptation measures to increase the city's resilience to the effects of climate change and increasing access for residents to recreational areas. The list of priorities did not include waste management due to its low contribution to the city's greenhouse gas emissions.

C

However, it is included on the list of impact pathways due to its significance for the circular economy and indirect impact on emissions. Sectors such as agriculture and industrial processes were not included among the priorities or pathways, as the impact of these sectors on Warsaw's overall emissions is traceable - on the verge of statistical error.

# 3.2 Module B-2 Designing a climate neutral portfolio

Below is a description of the portfolio of actions leading to achieving the reduction targets of the Climate City Contract and an outline of the individual actions that correspond to the defined priorities. Additionally, at the end of this section, there is a description of the portfolio of supporting actions that need to be implemented in order to support reduction efforts, to take care of important issues such as a just transition and the elimination of systemic barriers. In this version of the document, the support measures are described at a general level, because a large part of them have yet to be developed. In subsequent iterations of the document, the actions will be detailed.

|   | Impact (with reference to module B-1.1) | Investment in renewable energy generation, which is zero-carbon and reduces the city's CO2 emissions balance. Undertaking decarbonisation measures in collaboration with energy companies will enable a shift away from or a significant reduction in the fossil fuels currently used in the city's energy industry, resulting in a significant reduction in emissions within the city limits.  |

|   |  Comments concerning implementation – resources needed, timetable and milestones | Investment in measures aimed at decarbonising the energy industry, which at the moment is largely based on fossil fuels such as coal (75%), natural gas and fuel oil, are actions with a very high impact on the city's final reduction target. Using renewable sources as much as possible by switching to RES at source or building low-temperature heating systems will significantly reduce emissions and improve air quality.
The action of developing a heating network requires a lot of financial resources.
Developing the heating network in new investment areas is often uneconomic or infeasible due to the dispersal of customers or the cost recovery of its implementation.
However, developing this network in highly urbanised areas is also hampered by the technical complexity of the solutions and the necessary interference with existing infrastructure.
Furthermore, developing small district heating networks based on local heat pump-fired boiler houses provides an alternative for all those areas of the city where the district heating network does not reach or where there are fossil fuel-fired boiler houses.
The actions may include, for example, constructing new sections of the heating network and new heat connections, constructing modern individual single and double-function heat substations, liquidating  |

|   | Comments concerning implementation – resources needed, timetable and milestones | Waste heat (from industrial processes, refrigeration processes, subways, server rooms) can be used locally to raise the temperature of the heating medium in district heating network pipelines. This would mean a reduction in producing system heat from fossil fuel sources located within the city. However, this action requires a very strong involvement of external actors such as large industrial plants with such waste heat and their cooperation on many levels with the city. Such actions generate great costs concerning the construction of heat exchangers and building district heating plants. In this regard there is a need for regulation at the national level to make it profitable for these actors to invest in such solutions.  |

|   |  Comments concerning implementation – resources needed, timetable and milestones | The development of electricity storage should be preceded by an analysis of its use, location, and the capacity required in the current electricity grid. Investments in building local storage facilities for electricity from renewable energy sources can be used as an energy buffer for the city's existing electricity grid and serve primarily to compensate for energy losses occurring on the grid. They require great amounts of financial resources as well as involving private entrepreneurs, who often have surplus unused but produced electricity.  |

|   |  | What is needed here is a system of incentives and support programmes for those who want to have such energy storage facilities. Following regulatory changes are needed at national level in this area. Stoen Operator Sp. z o.o. currently operates an energy storage facility in Warsaw. An energy storage lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 62 kWh represents a reduction in emissions of 43.4 kgCO2e. Only the existing energy storage facility was used in the calculations, due to the lack of studies concerning the construction of new energy storage facilities in the city.  |

|   |  Comments concerning implementation – resources needed, timetable and milestones | Developing the city's electrical power infrastructure constitutes a complex infrastructural undertaking dependent on a number of both technical and financial factors. From the point of view of the increasing use of RES, electrical power grids need to be continuously developed so that they do not break down and are better managed. Implementing smart grid management systems primarily involves using systems to: optimise energy transmission in power operators' networks, supervise energy flow in smart grids, manage local energy storage.

In addition, it is used to monitor and control the manner in which energy is distributed (in lines and at substations) and to determine consumer needs, to manage generation sources and to monitor energy flow lines, and to optimise energy flow from a cost and demand perspective.

National policies related to network design guidelines, use and development also have an impact on this.  |

The districts of Praga-Poludnie and Ursynów include deficiencies in the continuity of greenery, which should be remedied by the various measures taken, just as their quality should be systematically improved. Implementing a comprehensive system for managing the city's blue-green infrastructure is key to keeping it in good condition and providing high levels of ecosystem services, building the city's resilience to climate risks. It depends on land ownership and management structure, which is dispersed in the city. In 2016, the Warsaw Greenery Board (a budgetary unit of Warsaw established by Resolution No. XXXIII/816/2016 of the City Council of 25 August 2016), which cares for and finances the care and development of green spaces in the city, including city parks, gardens, squares, greens. managing green spaces and some surface water constitutes the responsibility of a number of municipal entities both central at the city level and territorial in the districts. Implementing uniform management and standards of caring for and developing blue-green infrastructure areas and applying them by all responsible parties in the city will be a key task to ensure the proper functioning of the BZI system.  |

# Dialogue between the city of Warsaw and PGNiG Termika S.A.

Warsaw's central district heating network is mainly supplied by several sources owned by PGNiG Termika S.A., which developed a Climate Neutrality Plan in June 2024. System heat generation activities are a very important element of the city's energy transition and have been recognized as one of the supporting activities for the Buildings and Heat sector (p. 114). As part of the dialogue on including stakeholders from all sectors in the joint climate effort, PGNiG Termika S.A. has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the City of Warsaw. PGNiG Termika S.A.'s actions, such as using waste and renewable heat to produce system heat, maintaining the status of an efficient district heating system, generating low- and zero-emission electricity locally in cogeneration to meet the needs of the Warsaw agglomeration in order to counteract the import of energy from outside, or increasing the efficiency of heat production by building a flue gas heat recovery facility, will positively contribute to building a more resilient, equitable and sustainable future for our community and our city.

# B-2.3: Summary of residual emissions strategy

To bridge the potential gap between emission reductions of up to 80% and net climate neutrality, we envisage the following measures:

increasing the efficiency of natural CO2 sequestration (through selecting vegetation and increasing areas of blue-green infrastructure) within the mission districts and outside the boundaries of these districts, but within the administrative boundaries of the city,
geological sequestration (its use will depend on the emergence of new, more efficient and cheaper technologies),
Purchasing carbon credits - certificates confirming the reduction of greenhouse gases by investing in an environmental project (the issue of purchasing carbon credits must, however, be analysed by the municipal legal and accounting services for their compliance with the regulations governing the operation of the local authority).

A concrete action plan will be presented in one of the following iterations of the document.

The following constitutes a description of the portfolio of support measures that are necessary in terms of facilitating the implementation of reduction measures and taking care of important social issues. The actions are address to previously identified system barriers and constraints.

# 4. Part C - Enabling climate neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module C-1 Innovation interventions in terms of organisation and management

### C-1.1: Description or visualisation of a participatory governance model to achieve climate neutrality

The city cannot achieve the targets set in the CCC on its own, given that its units are only directly responsible for 7.5% of emissions. Achieving the 80% reduction target in the selected districts will only be possible with the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders and gaining broad public acceptance, and that is why the implementation process involves the active participation of stakeholders at many levels. This process is based on bodies that already exist (Climate Team, Transition Team) or are currently being constituted (National Cooperation Platform). The activities carried out within the CCC will be coordinated by the Department of Air Protection and Climate Policy, a unit established in the City of Warsaw to initiate and coordinate operations in favour of the climate.

Elements of multi-level process management:

An internal Transition Team, made up of city officials, employees of city companies, and representatives of districts, will mainly deal with agreeing on the operational aspects of activities and plans that require cross-sectoral coordination and cooperation, discussing their implementation and needed adjustments. The internal Transition Team will also commission analyses concerning the impact of individual measures on various aspects of the city's functioning, particularly in terms of a just climate transition and the impact on residents' health and well-being. It will also cooperate with the External Transition Team within the framework of sectoral cooperation (concerning transport, energy, buildings, etc.).

The External Transition Team, composed additionally of city stakeholders (contract signatories and other interested representatives from business, science, civil society, and public institutions) will be in charge of: agreeing on sectoral activities and priorities, determining the field of cooperation,

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

the contribution of individual stakeholders to the action, responsibilities and methods for verifying the effectiveness of the action, discussing the degree of implementation of the action, and needed adjustments.

Due to the large number of stakeholders, meetings focusing on specific sectors (buildings, energy, transport, etc.), among stakeholders involved in the sector, will be most appropriate. The External Transition Team will be able to set up working groups of selected stakeholders to work on developing new solutions (technical, organisational, funding, etc.), problem solving or project groups. It will also constitute a forum where stakeholders can share their knowledge, experiences, solutions and invite experts from specific fields with knowledge that can support particular activities or the CCC process itself.

The Programme Board - will meet periodically. These will be meetings of the entire Transition Team, with the participation of representatives of the boards of the districts implementing the climate contract and of the district councils, representatives of the government and central institutions, representatives of regional authorities, with the possibility of residents' participation. It will discuss crucial action plans and priorities, analyse the workflow and monitoring results, identify the needed directional changes, discuss proposals, as well as identify barriers and needs. The Board will also recommend the need to update the Climate City Contract.

National Cooperation Platform - bringing together representatives of the cities participating in the EC Mission and representatives of the Polish government, mainly ministries that are signatories to the CCC. Its aim is to discuss the manners of the needed support (legislative, financial, technical, etc.) and the necessary interventions at the national level to enable the CCC to be implemented and potential barriers to be addressed.

Climate Team - the results of monitoring the implementation of the Climate City Contract will be presented to the Climate Team. Key implementation findings and needs to support the implementation of activities or adjustments of activities at the strategic level (including CCC updates) will also be addressed to the team. The team will issue recommendations to the City Board concerning the mobilisation of additional resources or actions to facilitate, streamline contract implementation, and deal with identified barriers.

Reports concerning the progress in implementing the Climate City Contract will also be reported periodically to the City Board and Warsaw City Council as well as the boards and councils of the mission districts.

## C-2.2: Description of innovative social measures

Warsaw is implementing a number of initiatives and projects in the area of innovative social measures aimed at meeting real social needs and solving specific problems. The objective of social innovations is to develop processes and tools for addressing future challenges. Their characteristic feature consists in the involvement of urban stakeholders in their development, to whom the developed ideas and solutions are addressed.

Warsaw is implementing the "Generate Innovation Programme", which was adopted for implementation by order of the Mayor of Warsaw 1947/2021 on 9 December 2021 as an executive programme for one of the objectives. "#Warsaw2030 Strategy". The programme is addressed at Warsaw-based creatives and innovators - representatives of startups, creative and innovative companies, scientists, artists, and cultural creators. The programme is also aimed at institutional actors from the business, science, culture, and business environment sectors. An important group of stakeholders in the programme are the employees of the local government administration of Warsaw.

#

Some of the projects implemented under the programme can be used to meet the objectives of the Climate City Contract. The experiences and developed tools can also be used as inspiration for further innovative initiatives.

The Warsaw Booster programme, which serves as an accelerator for innovative projects and start-ups, can generate ideas to be used in contract activities. The Research Issue Exchange can be used in a similar manner for joint research projects between the scientific world and local governments, as well as the Urban Living Lab, which aims to generate innovative solutions and foster innovation in response to real needs and challenges in the city.

The WawaShare programme stimulates residents and city stakeholders to engage in activities related to the circular economy.

Other social innovations, implemented independently of the "We Generate Innovations" programme include:

**Participatory Budgeting (BO)**, which mobilises specific financial resources for residents and the support of officials to implement the ideas they have developed for specific urban investments. Although, the most common ideas put forward and implemented concern the development of green spaces.

**Partnership for Climate**, which is a platform for exchanging knowledge, experience, ideas, but also a place where ideas for implementing specific projects in the city are generated. It brings together diverse stakeholders (NGOs, businesses, institutions, universities, diplomatic missions).

**Green Fund for Warsaw** - a fund dedicated to entrepreneurs. It allows funding measures in favour of developing green spaces in the city. Following its example, Warsaw plans to set up a Sustainable Energy Investment Fund that would have the potential to raise funds from external sources for measures related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including support for developing RES and improving energy efficiency.

In the years 2020-2021, Warsaw also organised its first citizens' panel, the Warsaw Climate Panel. 90 residents, selected at random, decided on climate policy in the area of increasing Warsaw's energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy sources in the city's energy balance. The 49 recommendations developed and voted on by the panellists are now being implemented in the city. Citizen panels could be another social innovation to be used for developing solutions to the challenges of implementing the Climate City Contract.

# 5. Prospects and following steps

## The planned activities for the following iterations of the Climate Contract Action Plan

The initial version of the Action Plan contains key assumptions and a description of activities developed on the basis of those included in the Green Vision for Warsaw (with the assumption of intensifying them and increasing their scale in the districts covered by the Climate City Contract), supplemented by ideas for additional activities aimed at closing the emissions gap. Due to a lack of sufficient data, the scale and scope of activities has, in this version of the Action Plan, been developed at a general level and includes approximate values.

Future iterations of the Action Plan will address the following issues:

Taking into account the specific characteristics of the districts. All planned activities require a more accurate estimation of the possible scale of implementation separately for each
7

Warsaw

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

district. This estimation must take into account the opportunities that exist within them to accelerate, increase the scope and intensity of activities, and the possibility of applying new solutions to close the emissions gap. On this basis, action plans will be refined, reviewed, and missing activities are going to be added.

Identifying thermal modernisation needs in districts. In order to more accurately determine the needs of the mission districts for the deep thermal modernisation of buildings, an inventory of the buildings in terms of their energy intensity must be prepared. On the basis of this, specific quarters requiring deep thermal modernisation as a matter of priority (municipal and private buildings) will be identified. The successive addition of new data to the national Integrated Low Emission Reduction System (ZONE), of which the Central Emission Inventory for Buildings (CEEB) is a part will be helpful in this regard. Additional measures on the part of the city, such as thermal imaging mapping of buildings, are also being considered.

Analysing the potential for developing RES in districts. In order to maximise using the possibilities of decarbonisation by increasing the share of RES in the energy mix of districts, a thorough analysis should be carried out concerning the possibilities of using various sources of renewable energy. It must concern examining the potential of the roofs of buildings in districts (particularly large-scale buildings), the roofing of car parks and sheds, as well as sites suitable for ground-mounted installations, for photovoltaic systems. There must also be an analysis concerning the use of renewable energy sources in heating on a larger scale: the possibility of installing heat pumps (large-scale, smaller, individual), the use of ambient heat (shallow geothermal, deep geothermal), heat from sustainable biomass (certified) and other sources (solar panels, biomethane/biogas). The potential for RES energy storage is also to be explored. The results of the analysis will be incorporated into a revised Action Plan.

Analysis of the potential of municipal companies for RES development. Selected municipal companies own properties in the mission districts (e.g. Miejskie Zakłady Autobusowe - Zajezdnia Autobusowa Ostrobramska, Warszawskie Metro - Stacja Techniczno-Postojowa Kabaty). The potential of these properties for RES investments, on the basis of which specific investments will be planned, is to be examined.

Examining the opportunities to provide green energy to districts. Subsequent iterations of the Action Plan will require assessing the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of increasing the level of green energy produced outside the administrative boundaries of the mission districts. This concerns both purchasing certified green energy from the National Grid and using energy generated from municipal sources - generated by municipal companies or entities of Warsaw.

Mapping and analysing the potential waste heat source potential. Subsequent iterations must include a map of waste heat sources created together with stakeholders and an analysis of the possibilities for their use. Currently, the possibility of using waste heat from the metro for heating and hot water in flats is being examined in cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark and Danish companies, and the possibility of feeding heat from the metro into the Warsaw district heating network is being examined in cooperation with Veolia Energia Warszawa. Miejskie Przedsiębiorstwo Wodociągów i Kanalizacji is also exploring the possibility of recovering heat from municipal wastewater in cooperation with energy distributors PGNiG TERMIKA S.A. and Veolia Energia Warszawa. Zakład Unieszkodliwiania Stałych Odpadów Komunalnych (Municipal Solid Waste Treatment Plant) is being modernised and expanded (with the addition of a thermal waste treatment plant). The plant will process almost 300,000 tonnes of waste per year, producing heat and electricity for the city. Other sources of waste

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

heat recovery, such as industrial processes, server rooms, refrigeration processes, transport, are to be explored and mapped, together with municipal stakeholders. The results of these studies, and the resulting plans for the mission districts, will be taken into account in subsequent versions of the Action Plan.

Taking into account the phenomenon of energy poverty. The phenomenon of energy poverty is not yet thoroughly examined in Warsaw. Currently, the Scientific Foundation of the Institute for Structural Research (IBS), at the commission of C40 Cities, is preparing a tool for Warsaw to support investment decisions concerning thermal modernisation of buildings based on energy poverty criteria, which will be handed over to Warsaw. A thorough analysis of the phenomenon in the mission districts, in terms of specificity and scale of occurrence, will be crucial for developing specific equitable transformation solutions and support processes for the poorest groups that will be included in the following iterations of the Action Plan.

Analysis of the potential for developing electromobility. Also to be explored and incorporated into the plans that will emerge in the following iterations of the Action Plan is a thorough examination of the potential for developing electromobility in the mission districts in two areas: the possibility of developing a network of electric vehicle charging stations and hubs, and the possibility of increasing the number of bus routes served by electric buses.

Stakeholder collaboration plans. Subsequent iterations of the document will include increasingly concrete plans of action and ways to support implementing the Climate City Contract obtained from key stakeholders. These will be developed during the collaboration in terms of the External Transition Team and individual agreements. This includes municipal stakeholders (municipal companies), private actors, NGOs, companies, institutions.

Activities carried out in terms of agreements with energy producers and suppliers. A strategic partnership with the energy sector is required (due to the city's dependence on independent energy suppliers) in order to implement key measures related to the decarbonisation of heat and power production. Thanks to agreements with electricity and heat suppliers, it will be possible to identify more precisely the opportunities to increase the share of renewable energy supplied from the grid to CCC districts, energy storage and opportunities to reduce energy losses on transmission networks and distribution lines, and to plan specific actions for subsequent iterations of the document.

Systemic barrier solutions. Representatives of the cities participating in the EC Mission and representatives of the Government of the Republic of Poland (the ministries most important for implementing the CCC) work together in a National Cooperation Platform to discuss ways of required support (legislative, financial, technical, etc.) and necessary interventions at the national level to enable implementing the CCC and eliminating systemic barriers. Meetings have already taken place concerning the sources of funding for decarbonisation measures and the barriers to using them, as well as concerning the needs of local governments for support from the Polish Government. A following meeting is planned to discuss the draft National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030. The developed solutions will be taken into account in subsequent iterations of the Action Plan.

Engaging private capital. In the following iterations of the Action Plan, sources of funding for individual measures will be supplemented, with a particular focus on involving private capital, such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), Energy Service Company (ESCO) formulas, or through establishing dedicated funds for various measures, e.g. the Energy Service Company

(ESCO). Sustainable Energy Investment Fund - along the lines of the Green Fund for Warsaw, which has been operating in the city for several years and provides an opportunity for private entities to finance municipal investment in blue-green infrastructure.

Detailed implementation plans. With subsequent iterations, starting from Q4 2024, the actions contained in the document will be detailed and specific cells and units of Warsaw will be assigned to them, responsible for their implementation, in accordance with their terms of reference. It will also include more specific commitments from individual stakeholders. An important element will also consist in finding a way or designing a process for working on the document "in constant change", which is not currently practised in city document structures.
Development plan for the blue-green infrastructure. The following versions of the document will detail an action plan for developing the blue-green infrastructure for the mission districts, based on a specific analysis of needs and risks, including: information concerning valuable areas threatened by urbanisation pressures, information on the potential for increasing planting areas for various layers of vegetation, an inventory of potential land to be purchased for investment in blue-green infrastructure. The plan will also include a description of ways to eliminate or reduce the impact of the diagnosed threats, actions to create or restore internal natural links in the districts, plans to limit urbanisation of areas predisposed to the creation of blue-green infrastructure (including for as yet unurbanised agricultural and post-agricultural land and forest in the Ursynów District and areas providing biological cover for surface waters), a plan for the protection and development of public green areas and protection of forest resources, measures to reduce investment pressure on hydrologically active areas, and a plan for on-site rainwater management and reduction of soil sealing.
The concept of creating a 15-minute city. Discussions are currently being carried out with representatives of the University of Warsaw in terms of producing a feasibility study and plan for the mission districts on how their urban space can be transformed in line with the 15-minute city concept.

# 1 Introduction

The conclusions included in the latest - 6th report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC (IPCC AR6 WGI) indicate that there is a high risk that the 2015 Paris Agreement targets of limiting global warming to well below 2°C and ultimately stopping it at 1.5°C, relative to the pre-industrial era, will not be achieved. This means that we have one last chance to stop global warming and that actions aimed at achieving climate neutrality has gained critically urgent and global priority status.

According to the GHG Protocol for Cities. An Accounting and Reporting Standard for Cities, cities account for approx. 70% of greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time driving the growth of the global economy, producing about 80% of global GDP. They are occupied by approx. 55% of the world's population (World Cities Report 2022) and about 60% of Poles (CSO 2023) and they constitute the largest consumers and sometimes also generators of heat and electricity.

They are the places where most construction takes place (critical infrastructure is being built, among other things), they constitute the centres of industry, business, the recipients of most consumer goods, the places of particularly high concentrations of movements of people and goods, as well as the largest generators of waste.

Climate change is increasingly important in terms of health, the economy, urban infrastructure, and public safety. Cities constitute large population centres, have dense buildings, extensive infrastructure, and depend on external resource supplies, making them particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The urban population is particularly vulnerable to the effects of warming due to the nature of the urbanised environment, which stimulates negative phenomena such as urban heat islands. Therefore, transformational activities concerning both reducing the demand and consumption of resources as well as their efficient use should be accelerated. As Poland's largest city and its administrative capital, Warsaw is aware of its important role in the quest for climate neutrality. The city is inhabited by more than 5% of the country's population (Central Statistical Office, 2022), with its users constituting an additional 1% - which amounts to nearly 2 million people functioning in Warsaw on a daily basis. The largest central offices, institutions, as well as headquarters of many national and international companies and institutions are located here. Therefore, the city has a significant share of national greenhouse gas emissions and, as the capital, a major opinion-forming role.

Therefore, the Capital City of Warsaw wants to play a leading role in the region and in the country in climate actions: to implement, test, and replicate new solutions and set the trends for other cities in Poland and Europe.

Joining the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" constitutes the following step for Warsaw and a logical consequence of its long-standing climate policy. It consists in bringing existing objectives and plans down to a very specific, operational, local level. It also constitutes an opportunity to obtain substantive and financial support for planned and ongoing operations responding to the increasingly urgent climate challenges – primarily taking into consideration the needs of the city and its residents in this regard. It provides an opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences, a chance to learn from each other, to prototype, test, and modify specific solutions as well as gather experiences that can be replicated and used on a larger scale. However, participating in the EU Mission is primarily an additional incentive to mobilise all possible stakeholders and resources to implement climate actions. This stimulus is particularly important in the context in which Polish cities operate. In Poland, after many years of neglect, a coherent climate policy is only just beginning to be established at a
4

Warsaw

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

national level. As a result, the more ambitious cities need to look for additional sources of support and opportunities for their pro-climate measures.

Warsaw has established city-wide climate goals in its key climate policy document, the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP). These are a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest.

In joining the EU Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030," Warsaw declared by setting a reduction target of 80% by 2030 for two selected city districts. This decision was dictated by awareness of local and systemic opportunities and constraints, as explained in detail later in this document.

# Warsaw's climate policy

Warsaw has been pursuing a consistent climate policy for many years through the following measures:

2007 - Warsaw joins the C40 Cities association, an organisation bringing together the world's metropolises working together on climate protection. Warsaw is a member of five working groups and a signatory to several agreements and declarations, the implementation of which has had a very positive impact on adaptation and mitigation measures, as well as the quality of life and health of the population.
2009 - joining the European Commission initiative Covenant of Mayors - 31 August 2021 the Warsaw City Council has adopted Position No. 37 on a new climate declaration as part of the international initiative "Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy". It obliges the Capital City of Warsaw to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the goal of achieving climate neutrality in 2050, to increase the city's resilience and adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change, and to combat fuel poverty as one of the key actions to ensure a just transition.
2009 - Adopting the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) - the first document of a strategic nature that set out the principles for developing urban transport in a sustainable manner (on 16 November 2023 the Warsaw City Council adopted the new Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan for the Warsaw metropolitan area - SUMP).
2011 - Adopting the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) - aimed at reducing the city's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere by, among other things, increasing energy production from renewable sources.
2016 - Adopting the Environmental Protection Programme for the period 2017-2020 with a view to 2023 (updated in 2021. A new programme up to 2030 is currently under development), indicating actions aimed at improving the quality of life in the city through sustainable development, preserving the significant values of the natural environment, improving its condition, improving spatial order, and developing environmental infrastructure (equipment, systems, as well as activities aimed at protecting and improving the environment), protecting the climate, and adapting the city to its changes.
2018 - Adopting the #Warsaw 2030 Development Strategy - a general document that defines the city's vision, strategic and operational goals. Works on updating the document, including making climate issues (mitigation and adaptation) a higher priority in the city's strategic goals, is currently underway.

Warsaw

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

2019 - Adopting the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the Capital City of Warsaw by 2030 with a perspective to 2050. Municipal Adaptation Plan (Resolution No. XV/339/2019 of the Warsaw City Council of 4 July 2019), constituting the policy of the Capital City of Warsaw in terms of taking action to prevent and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. The document describes the key threats resulting from climate change and the associated risk areas for Warsaw and its residents, as well as indicates the courses of action through which the City will protect itself against the negative effects of climate change-related phenomena.
2019 - Establishing the Air Protection and Climate Policy Department (BOPiPK) with the task of, inter alia, coordinating the city's climate policy, initiating activities and processes regarding mitigating and adapting to climate change.
2020 - carrying out a citizens' panel called: the Warsaw Climate Panel. The aim of the panel was to enable the citizens of Warsaw to participate in the decision-making process concerning increasing the energy efficiency of Warsaw and the share of renewable energy sources in the city's energy balance. A group of randomly selected 90 residents, representative for the city's social structure in terms of age, gender and education, came up with 49 recommendations, which are being implemented by Warsaw on the basis of the Mayor's commitment.
2023 - adopting the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP) (resolution No. LXXX/2648/2023 of the Warsaw City Council of 20 April 2023) - a document describing how the city can achieve climate neutrality by 2050. It is a comprehensive Green City &amp; Climate Action Plan. It is based on the city's declared levels of greenhouse gas reductions and pledge to aim for climate neutrality. The GCCAP works in favour of achieving sustainable development goals while promoting social inclusion.
2022 - an application to the Pilot Cities Programme in terms of the EU 100 Cities Mission, receiving a grant and joining the consortium of the project NEEST - Climate Neutral and Environmentally Sustainable Urban Areas (Resolution of the Warsaw City Council No. LXXXVI/2839/2023 of 31 August 2023 on undertaking cooperation between the Capital City of Warsaw with the following cities: Kraków, Łódź, Rzeszów, and Wrocław in implementing the project)
2023 - the beginning of work on the General Plan, which, due to legislative changes in Poland will replace the existing Study of Conditions and Directions for Spatial Development of Warsaw - the main planning document defining the land use policy for the entire city area. The documents determining the city's spatial policy have a significant impact on the implementation of climate goals.
2023 - establishing the Climate Team chaired by the Mayor of the City of Warsaw - an interdisciplinary team composed of heads of units of the City of Warsaw and representatives of other municipal entities with the greatest impact on implementing the city's climate policy. The task of the team is to coordinate the implementation of projects and processes in the area of mitigation and adaptation, which are systemic and interdisciplinary in nature.
2023 - accessing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development project: Enhancing City-level Climate Governance: Implementation Plan and Initial Climate Risk Disclosure for the City of Warsaw, which aims to build awareness and competence in the city' departments and organisational units regarding a better understanding of climate change risks and potential opportunities, to help develop climate proofing processes for city investments and to support the

identification of an effective governance model to integrate climate issues into key city management and planning processes (climate governance).

Since 2007 as part of the Covenant of Mayors (SEAP), Warsaw has been carrying out a GHG inventory in 2-year cycles. As of 2018, the inventory is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the "GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard". The most recent inventory was carried out in 2023 and includes data concerning 2022 emissions.

# Documents outlining the climate policy

The Capital City of Warsaw currently includes three main documents outlining the climate and sustainable development policy:

The Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP - Green Cities and Climate Action Plan) - a "roadmap" containing the city's reduction targets and a description of measures for achieving them, as well as an action plan for a sustainable city.
Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the Capital City of Warsaw by 2030 with a perspective to 2050. Municipal Adaptation Plan - a document defining the city's policy to prepare and adapt Warsaw to ongoing climate change and support building the resilience of the city's residents to its effects, with acceptable economic, social and natural costs..
Environmental Protection Programme - an executive document for the #Warsaw 2030 Strategy (relating to operational objective: 3.2. We live in a clean natural environment), containing a diagnosis of the environment's state, main objective, performance areas, specific objectives, areas of intervention and targets that the city must take to protect the environment (its quality, functions), including climate protection.

The most comprehensive document describing climate policy goals and actions for achieving them is the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP).

It combines two methodologies used around the world: the Green City Action Plan, developed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Climate Action Plan, developed by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. Combining these two methodologies allowed producing a document that is comprehensively based on verified data.

Creating the GCCAP was preceded by a thorough analysis of the state of the city (based on 122 indicators) in terms of the pressures exerted by various areas of the city's functioning on the environment and climate, the state of the natural environment and the city's responses to environmental and climate risks to date.

The document establishes the climate objectives of the Capital City of Warsaw: a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. It includes:

Results of analysing the state of the city including identifying the most vulnerable and endangered areas.
A description of the 3 action scenarios and their consequences: a business-as-usual scenario, a reduction scenario (which we want to follow), and an extended scenario (assuming more ambitious climate targets possible in case of favourable external factors).
Long-term targets, indicating specific areas requiring action with a cut-off date for achieving the main reduction target, and short-term targets.

Warsaw

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

27 specific actions allowing to achieve short- and long-term goals, in the following areas: energy infrastructure, buildings, urban planning and blue-green infrastructure, transport, municipal waste, building social capital, and integration.
A description of the existing and potential challenges and barriers to achieving the stated objectives.
Estimated costs of activities (CAPEX and OPEX) as well as possible sources of funding.

The next natural step towards achieving climate neutrality is to participate in the European Commission's Mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030, which will allow Warsaw to:

speed-up operations in favour of climate-neutrality in two selected city districts and test solutions allowing to determine which are most effective and whether more ambitious citywide climate targets are feasible,
develop and promote systemic innovations in implementing urban investments towards climate neutrality,
mobilise the city's resources, those of the municipality and, above all, those in private hands, around ambitious climate goals and to gain experience in this area that can be implemented throughout the city. Mobilising stakeholders will also raise their awareness concerning the climate crisis, help to build a sense of shared responsibility for decarbonising and adapting the city in them,
gain substantive support and facilitate access to financial support for transformational activities.

# The Climate City Contract as an acceleration of the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP) for two districts that constitute laboratories for change.

We perceive participating in the EC Mission primarily as an opportunity to bring the city-wide goals and actions contained in the Green Vision for Warsaw to the local and maximally operationalised level. It will be valuable to learn lessons from their implementation for the city as a whole in order to implement the extended scenario described therein, as well as to adopt new, even more ambitious assumptions and develop innovative activities by 2030. Implementing the Climate City Contract with its ambitious reduction target for two large districts of Warsaw will also constitute a significant contribution in terms of reducing greenhouse gases on a city-wide scale.

Therefore, we are treating the CCC as an action aimed at accelerating and intensifying the implementation of the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP) for the two districts that constitute urban laboratories for change, for which the proposed actions will achieve a reduction in line with the Mission's targets of 80% or the base year.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

Warsaw has pledged to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest and this is a priority expressed in City Council Position No. 37 of 31 August 2021. However, in the face of the worsening climate crisis
8

Warsaw

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

and its effects being experienced more and more strongly in cities, accelerating decarbonisation measures is essential for the continued sustainability, safety, health, and functioning of residents and urban infrastructure.

The key document for the city, the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCAAP), identifies 3 climate scenarios for the entire city:

A business-as-usual scenario, taking into account the "no additional climate action" emissions projection, which is a scenario that serves as a baseline and comparison for the planned actions.
Reduction scenario, which defines long-term, achievable goals to achieve the Climate Action Plan (CAP). At the same time, they are linked to the short-term goals of the Green City Action Plan (GCAP), covering a 10-15 year time perspective.

This scenario assumes a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as an interim target (compared to 2007, equivalent to a 35% reduction compared to 2018) and climate neutrality in 2050.

An extended scenario, which is potentially possible to be implemented in the city if two conditions are met: the city will operate in favourable political conditions (Poland's climate policy will be developed, enabling Warsaw to meet its ambitious climate targets) and the city will receive sufficient financial resources (national and European) to implement pro-climate measures. This scenario assumes a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as an interim target (compared to 2007, equivalent to 50% compared to 2018).

The applicable scenario for the entire city is the reduction scenario. The level of the reduction target that has been set in terms of it is based on the following considerations:

The greenhouse gas inventory for Warsaw, for the years 2018, 2020, 2022, shows that almost three quarters of the city's emissions arise from the production of energy (electricity and heat) and its consumption by buildings.
The city has a highly limited impact on the sources of energy generation, which are regulated at national level. There are two energy companies within the city, which supply 80% of the city's heating needs, are independent of the city and are not obliged to consult their development plans with the local authority. The current domestic energy mix is based on fossil fuels. The main fuel is coal. For example, in 2022, 66.2% of the country's heat production came from coal and almost 16% from other fossil fuels: natural gas and fuel oil (Energy Regulatory Office - Report: Thermal power industry in numbers - 2022),
The results of the greenhouse gas inventory in Warsaw, for the years 2018, 2020, 2022, show that the share of municipal units in the emissions of the entire City of Warsaw oscillated around 7.5% (concerns the 1 and 2 emission range).
#

![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)

Nearly three quarters of Warsaw's greenhouse gas emissions result from the production and consumption of electricity and heat by buildings.

A quarter of the emissions are related to transport - primarily road and to a lesser extent rail, water, and air.

Approximately one% of emissions result from the treatment of waste generated within the city.

The above information shows that in terms of its climate neutrality efforts, including the pace of transition away from fossil energy sources at the national level, Warsaw is to a great degree dependent on external factors and the actions of the private sector and non-local government institutions.

Warsaw, despite its ambitious aspirations, has to face existing limitations, which is why the application for acceptance to the City Mission included a selected area of the city - two districts, Praga-Poludnie and Ursynów, for which greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of  $80\%$  by 2030 have been declared. Such an ambitious goal, very difficult to achieve on a city-wide scale, is possible on a more limited scale. Focusing on two districts and the smaller scale of activities will facilitate the involvement of shareholders, that are external to the City of Warsaw, to become involved in implementing the adopted objective (due to the smaller scale of activities) and to develop cooperation paths, which will help to create a city-wide cooperation system at a later stage.

The decision to identify two selected areas of the capital, the districts of Praga-Poludnie and Ursynów, was made because of their diversity and potential in terms of development structure, transport infrastructure, blue-green infrastructure areas, industrial and service development, as well as power grid characteristics. Moreover, they include a very similar emission structure in relation to that of the entire city, making them representative for Warsaw as a whole in this respect. Their location was also important due to their setting within the urban fabric in dense, relatively old buildings, as well as near the Vistula Rive (Praga-Poludnie) and on the outskirts of the city (Ursynów) with fairly modern, mainly residential and also large volume buildings, as well as the end of the metro line and a large area of greenery (the Kabacki Forest nature reserve) surrounding part of the district. Thanks to this, Warsaw has the opportunity to develop diverse innovative solutions in response to the various threats posed by the growing climate crisis, which can be replicated across the city. Other reasons for making this choice included the good cooperation with the districts to date, their commitment to climate-neutral activities and their awareness of their importance in the quest for climate neutrality and improving the lives of local people.

The idea behind preparing the CCC for the two Districts was to create so-called local centres (city labs) of climate transformation, progressive areas of the city to test the feasibility of implementing the solutions required to achieve climate neutrality in 2030 across the city.

![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)

Irrespective of the plans and actions developed in the Climate City Contract for the designated area of the two districts of Praga-Południe and Ursynów, work towards climate neutrality in the 2050 perspective will be carried out in parallel across all of Warsaw, in accordance with the goals and directions currently outlined in the Green Vision for Warsaw. At the same time, successful solutions, action paths, innovations and synergies developed for the districts covered by the Climate City Contract will be analysed on an ongoing basis for applicability in other districts of Warsaw in order to intensify operations concerning decarbonisation. The cooperation developed between the city's internal units, the relationships established with stakeholders, the good cooperation practices in the urban environment, will already be tested and ready to be implemented elsewhere.

## Additional benefits associated with adopting the Climate City Contract

In addition to the previously mentioned benefits of adopting an ambitious target for the districts submitted to the EU Mission, the districts, and consequently the entire city, will benefit as a result of intensified climate action:

increasing the city's energy independence in the face of an uncertain geopolitical situation through becoming independent from fossil fuels and increased national, regional and local energy sources,
increasing energy security through dispersing energy sources,
reducing the city's operating costs, through increased energy efficiency and an increased number of own as well as diversified energy sources,
reducing energy costs for residents by increasing energy efficiency and developing a prosumer model of energy generation,

increasing the awareness and involvement of residents in pro-climate transformation and operation in favour of the city, building co-responsibility for the city,
improving the quality of life and health for residents resulting from reduced air pollution and reduced levels of ambient noise, light pollution,
improving the quality and aesthetics of the urban space and making it more attractive,
increasing the city's resilience to the effects of climate change, through increased biodiversity, and expanding blue-green infrastructure,
an impulse for sustainable economic development thanks to developing new sectors working for the climate and energy transition and an increase in the economic competitiveness of the city,
creating new "green" jobs,
an impulse for scientific development and the formation of innovation,
greater social inclusion through the involvement and cooperation of various stakeholders,
developing and testing tools for reducing energy poverty, including by being able to resell green electricity or heat produced by the city on preferential terms to people in a difficult material situation and by reducing energy demand through energy efficiency improvements in buildings,
increasing the quality of life of residents, the level of health, as well as the tourist attractiveness of Warsaw and the surrounding area by expanding and diversifying the urban ecosystem and creating friendly places for recreation and relaxation,
increasing the area and ensuring the protection of nature-rich areas, increasing biodiversity and improving access to nature-rich areas for residents,
improving the convenience of connections and accessibility of public transport and cycling, as well as improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists,
less traffic, less road congestion due to a reduction in the proportion of individual transport on the road, increased use of public transport, and the implementation of the idea of 15-minute districts and communities,
increasing social inclusion and stimulating sustainable economic development by creating spaces with less traffic that can constitute local centres of community life,
reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill as well as improving local waste management and recycling rates.

Due to the fact that there are no large-scale ETS facilities within the administrative boundaries of the districts covered by the Climate City Contract, all facilities in their area are included in the reduction target.

# 3 Strategic priorities

In setting the strategic priorities, we relied on the results of the GHG inventory for Warsaw and the predictions of the economic model (an integrated tool for supporting the climate transition planning process, enabling data-driven strategic decision-making). We've placed emphasis on measures that will have the most measurable effect in terms of rapid $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction.

The following priorities concern implementing the Climate City Contract for the Ursynów and Praga Południe Districts. While they are based on the assumptions of the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP), they take into account local specificities.

According to the results of the latest GHG inventory (for 2022), Warsaw's dominant sector, in terms of emissions, consists in stationary energy (electricity and heat production and consumption by buildings), which accounts for 73% of the city's total emissions. Another key sector is transport, which accounts for 26% of Warsaw's emissions.

The above findings result in strategic, systemic priorities for the mission districts to achieve the 2030 reduction target. These are:

# System priority 1: changing the structure of energy sources - replacing fossil energy sources in the area of electricity and heat production and distribution with low-carbon/ renewable sources.

Key measures for drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving climate neutrality include a change in the energy mix concerning the sources of electricity and heat used in the Warsaw districts covered by the Climate City Contract.

One of the key elements of the priority consists in, as described in the Green Vision for Warsaw, a strategic partnership with the energy sector (energy distributors and producers) in terms of implementing strategies for achieving climate neutrality in areas such as: increasing energy production from non-fossil sources (e.g. biogas), modernising energy networks allowing optimum use of energy produced by prosumers, using waste energy, energy storage, increasing the offer of sales concerning certified green energy, green energy, searching for new energy supply sources (e.g hydrogen energy, geothermal energy). An important element of the priority will also be to increase the efficiency and synergy of activities through the implementation of integrated projects, combining the above elements (energy production from RES + energy storage (electricity/heat/cooling)+energy management systems, etc.).

Another element of the priority is to continue and intensify investments in RES in city-owned buildings and in municipal companies within the districts covered by the Climate City Contract (with due regard for the protection of historic buildings). The Urban Photovoltaic Development Programme, created in 2022, will be used for this. The city will continue its efforts to decarbonise city companies (Metro Warszawskie - en. Warsaw Metro, Miejskie Zakłady Autobusowe – en. Municipal Bus Company, Tramwaje Warszawskie – en. Warsaw Trams, Miejskie Przedsiębiorstwo Oczyszczania – en. Municipal Cleaning Company, Miejskie Przedsiębiorstwo Wodociągów i Kanalizacji – en. Municipal Water and Sewerage)

O

Company) by using owned properties for RES investments (solar energy, wind energy, biogas plants). The city will also continue its financial support for residents (grants for renewable energy sources in private properties and those belonging to housing associations and cooperatives) as well as substantive support in the form of a free energy advisory scheme that has been in place since 2021.

Another element for implementing the priority will consist in cooperation with stakeholders: businesses and institutions not related to local government, in the form of agreements for decarbonisation measures (including incorporating such measures into the ESG strategy of businesses) as well as promotional and educational activities.

The key stakeholders in implementing this priority are:

state-owned energy companies - energy producers. The rate of decarbonising the entire city depends, to a large extent, on the rate of decarbonising the CHP plants supplying the city with energy, including the most carbon-intensive building sector.
energy distributors - Warsaw's power grid is outdated and requires modernisation. It also requires investment in modern energy transmission management systems and energy storage. The profitability of investing in renewable energy sources in the city depends, to a large extent, on the absorption capacity of the grid.
the government of the Republic of Poland and relevant ministries - the main shareholder of energy companies is the Government of the Republic of Poland, which has an impact on their operations strategy and also the national decarbonisation policy. Moreover, legislative initiatives for more favourable settlements with prosumers for the electricity they supplied into the grid, or regulations allowing establishing energy cooperatives in cities, are needed to develop RES and the prosumer energy market.

# System priority 2: Reducing the demand for heat and electricity from fossil sources.

The system priority will be implemented mainly by increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. It assumes primarily the thermal modernisation of the municipal stock of residential and commercial buildings, as well as the thermal modernisation of private, cooperative buildings as well as those belonging to enterprises and institutions not associated with the local authority (with due regard for the protection of historic buildings). Therefore, in the next 3-5 years, the city will focus on carrying out modernisations of its own buildings to increase their energy efficiency and on creating incentives and support systems for private building owners to take such measures.

Currently, in terms of preparatory projects involving the preparation of analyses, the typing of buildings, developing modernisation models (NEEST project) as well as projects related to the preparation and implementation of thermomodernization investments for municipal buildings (ELENA project), the city is preparing to scale up thermal modernisation measures for city buildings.

Another element of implementing the priority consists in a system of free energy consulting for residents concerning technical issues and the use of municipal, regional, and national funding programmes.

Implementing the priority will be supported by the Warsaw Green Building Standard, which sets out requirements concerning urban buildings in terms of sustainable construction, including energy efficiency, and the Energy Management System being introduced in the city's buildings, which monitors electrical, heating, ventilation, and environmental parameters, optimising energy

by 2030

consumption. Similar solutions will be promoted to private building owners, entrepreneurs, and developers, with whom agreements will be established to cooperate in this scope.

Other measures, in terms of implementing the priority, consist in continuing the modernisation of the city's outdoor lighting through the use of LED luminaires, which will reduce energy consumption by 40%, as well as recovering and using waste heat from production processes, cooling systems, server rooms, subways, wastewater, and other sources in the districts covered by the Climate City Contract.

In implementing this priority, the main stakeholders are:

the Government of the Republic of Poland, the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, and other operators of funding programmes - the deep thermo-modernisation of buildings involves great costs (for own investments or financial support for residents), hence the key role here is to ensure adequate funding for local authorities from external sources,

science sector - reducing the demand for primary energy requires constantly searching for and implementing innovative solutions in the form of: ways to reduce consumption, energy recovery methods, ways to use waste energy, efficient storage, of surplus energy,

municipal companies as well as manufacturing, commercial, and service companies - these are entities consuming great amounts of energy and having a high potential for reducing consumption and using waste energy,

construction and renovation companies, as well as housing associations and cooperatives - building operators and building administrators have a huge impact on developing and implementing new energy standards in new and renovated buildings. Without commitment on their part, it will be difficult to carry out effective activities in this area,

residents, especially in the area of maintaining the principles of a fair energy transition and protecting vulnerable groups.

# System priority 3: Development and promotion of sustainable transport

Transport constitutes the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Warsaw, after stationary energy, accounting for 25.6% of all emissions and a major source of air pollution. These emissions are mainly generated by road transport, with individual car transport accounting for the largest share. Therefore, the key actions concerning priority 3 focus on developing low-carbon alternative modes of urban travel, which will become an attractive (comfortable, accessible, safe) alternative for a large proportion of people travelling around the city using individual car transport.

Warsaw is steadily increasing the level of electrifying public transport. There are currently more than 160 electric buses, 70 hybrid buses, and 418 gas-powered buses operating in Warsaw. In 2023, the Public Transport Authority signed a contract for the purchase of additional 12 electric buses. This trend will continue, with an increased number of lines served by electric buses in the mission districts. The city is also testing hydrogen-powered buses.

The Green Vision for Warsaw includes the "Further development of urban integrated rail transport" (Polish: Dalszy rozwój miejskiego zintegrowanego transportu szynowego) operation, as part of which an intensive expansion of the tramway network, which is now 134 km long, and the extension of the Fast Urban Rail network are taking place. The aim of the operation consists in increasing the number of people travelling by public transport, decreasing the number of private cars travelling through the
5

WORSW

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

city, and reducing the average journey time by rail transport from the suburbs to the city centre. Further development of existing and construction of new subway lines is also planned.

In 2023, the number of public transport passengers exceeded 955 million, compared to 863 million the year before. This is an increase of almost 100 million. Buses carried the most passengers (the bus network is the largest) with more than 450 million, and the metro had the highest increase of passengers with more than 40 million compared to 2022.

Reducing the scale of individual car transport will also be facilitated by a systematic improvement in the comfort and safety of public transport travel thanks to purchasing new rolling stock, modernising and creating new P+R car parks, increasing the number of safe and accessible stops, developing environmentally friendly (green tracks and green stops) transport infrastructure, measures to increase passenger comfort in transport waiting areas, dosing traffic by means of a traffic control system and by changing the cross-section of the roadways, as well as o the introduction of priority for public transport (priority in traffic lights, the traffic lights, separation of bus lanes).

Other measures in favour of carrying out the priority include systematically expanding the bicycle infrastructure (the bicycle network in the capital city already has 773.4 km of routes), developing the Veturilo system, which is one of the largest urban bicycle systems in Europe, expanding paid parking zones, creating the Clean Transport Zone, expanding pedestrian infrastructure (by modernising and greening streets, widening pavements, creating safe pedestrian crossings, reducing traffic), educational campaigns. These activities will be particularly intensified in the districts covered by the Climate City Contract.

Support for the development of electromobility is an another element aimed at reducing emissions from individual car transport. Developing electromobility will consist in the form of investing, together with private partners, in appropriate infrastructure, expanding the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, promoting Car-sharing and other forms of vehicle sharing

In this case, the main stakeholders include:

the Government of the Republic of Poland, the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, and other operators of funding programmes - investments in public transport are costly, so securing adequate funding for local authorities from external sources plays a key role in this regard. Whereas, the development of electromobility requires support through, for example, proper tax breaks or subsidies for purchasing electric vehicles,
companies - operators of vehicle charging stations so that a proper infrastructure can be developed and maintained to encourage the purchase and use of electric vehicles,
municipal companies - responsible for developing pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, as well as the public transport network,
residents - the issues of reducing car traffic and changing transport habits are socially important topics, and therefore the residents of the areas affected by the changes will be involved in each consultation process concerning specific solutions.

# System priority 4: Developing blue-green infrastructure

Warsaw is a city with a very high proportion of greenery - the ratio of open green areas (understood as parks, public and residential green areas, as well as protected areas) per 100,000 residents is high, and urban forests alone account for approx. 15% of the city's area. However, these areas need to be protected against excessive urbanisation pressures, re-naturalised, enhanced in terms of providing ecosystem services, as well as increasing the area of biologically active surface where this is possible and most needed. As part of protecting the blue-green infrastructure, the city will, inter alia, through Local Spatial Development Plans, impact the density of urban development in such a way as to protect areas of natural value and to ensure the sustainability of development (Warsaw has a relatively low density of development, but is threatened by excessive horizontal building development).

Measures concerning densification will affect the Ursynów district to a greater extent, as Praga Południe is the district with the highest population density in Warsaw.

Maintaining and developing the blue-green infrastructure is very important both in terms of sequestering excess carbon, as well as adaptation measures for increasing the city's resilience to the effects of climate change and increasing access for residents to recreational areas.

The planned activities include: securing natural areas not covered by protection (without legal forms of nature protection or local plans) from further urbanisation pressure (which will help ensure the protection of environmentally valuable areas, such as elements of the hydrographic system with a biological enclosure like Zgorzała Lake in Ursynów, or Gocławskie and Balaton lakes, as well as Wystawowy and Gocławskie canals in South Praga), planting trees and shrubs, increasing biologically active areas and unsealing impermeable surfaces, expanding small retention facilities, water reservoir revitalization.

These activities will be implemented both through direct city investments such as the continuation of the modernisation and greening of streets programme, tree planting as part of the existing Million Trees for Warsaw programme (in which residents suggest planting sites using an app), the green track programme and other activities. District and citywide programmes for removing concrete from backyards and squares will also be continued and developed. Supporting measures consist of implementing and enforcing greenery management standards (standard for information on cuttings, standard for protecting greenery in investment processes, standard for tree care and pruning, standard for dendrological reviews and analyses).

The city will also encourage residents, cooperatives, housing communities, and businesses to remove concrete surfaces, plant greenery, and set up small-scale retention facilities on land owned by them, through education (e.g. Warsaw Climate Change Adaptation Guidebook) and support programmes - expert advice from municipal entities and grant programmes for small-scale retention facilities, as well as the civic budget.

These activities will be similar for both mission districts, but with a different distribution of emphasis due to their specificities. The peripheral Ursynów District includes large areas of green space (including the vast Kabacki Forest), so the emphasis here will be on protecting and expanding green spaces. On the other hand, the Praga Południe District is a central district with more dense development, where the priority will be to increase the biologically active area, e.g. by removing concrete surfaces and installing small retention facilities.

The key stakeholders for Priority 4 are:

municipal entities and companies and district offices, which are land administrators,
7

Warsaw

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

the Greenery Management Board of the City of Warsaw - with regard to investments concerning blue-green infrastructure in the areas subordinate to the unit as well as establishing and enforcing greenery management standards,
cooperatives, administrators of buildings and undeveloped land, housing communities,
companies and institutions possessing property in the mission districts,
universities and research institutions in terms of finding new solutions concerning developing blue-green infrastructure,
residents who must be consulted in terms of how public land is developed.

For all the above-mentioned priorities, the residents of the districts implementing the CCC and representatives of civil society (NGOs, urban movements, associations) constitute very important stakeholders, as implementing the measures described will have a huge impact on their lives (financial resources, comfort of living and moving around the city, or lifestyle). They can also have a strong impact on other stakeholders, e.g. as members of housing associations or cooperatives and on developers as customers. We will continue to develop cooperation with residents and NGOs, supporting them in changing their energy consumption behaviour, modernising their housing stock and transport habits.

# 4 Process and principles

The City of Warsaw treats the EU's mission of "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" as a key element of its climate policy, as well as an opportunity to rank it higher rank in the city's hierarchy of priorities.

The city has been implementing decarbonisation and sustainability measures for many years. However, for a long time these were grassroots activities, carried out by cells, units, and municipal companies without systemic coordination. As a result, municipal resources and provided funds have not been optimally utilised due to a lack of synergy and systemic planning.

The plans and programmes emerging in the city were sectoral, because in the city's main strategy #Warsaw2030, the climate objective was not one of the main objectives. As a first step towards synchronising and optimising all city activities in a systemic way, the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP) was developed, a document preceded by an analysis of the state of the city, based on data, bringing together the city's most important measures for sustainable development and climate neutrality and describing them in a way that facilitates implementing (specific objectives and actions, schedule) and indicates how progress is to be monitored (indicators and monitoring system). The following step consisted of establishing the Climate Team, which coordinates climate policy in the city across the substantive "silos" of the City Hall. The city is also preparing for the evaluation of the Adaptation Strategy in 2024, with the aim of linking mitigation and adaptation measures systemically, including by creating a single monitoring and evaluation system for all climate policy issues. The city includes also a number of interdisciplinary groups and working teams dealing with specific projects or processes that go beyond the responsibility of individual units.

Undertaking the Mission and implementing the Climate City Contract will allow, independently of the city-wide measures described in the Green Vision for Warsaw, not only accelerating the
8

Warsaw

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

decarbonisation measures within the two districts, but also entering into an even higher level of planning, synchronisation and inclusiveness in implementing the city's climate goals. The smaller scale of the action (two districts, not the entire city), will allow to develop, in a safe way - on the principle of urban laboratories - cooperation mechanisms and ways of action, which can be applied in other districts.

In the process of implementing the CCC, we want to build on our previous good experiences, adding to them the experience and knowledge we have gained in the course of implementing the activities: from our project partners, advisors, other cities, stakeholders, etc.

We also want to extend the involvement of stakeholders and residents in the entire process - to make them feel even more like hosts of the city, co-responsible for its shape and functioning in the future. We will also support them in this process in the course of cooperation with external stakeholders.

In this regard we will take advantage of our extensive experience from past participatory and consultative processes. Warsaw has been involving residents and stakeholders in important decision-making processes for many years through:

Consulting residents and stakeholders on key plans and actions. Since 2010, 2353 public consultations have taken place in Warsaw.
Current information about them can be found on a dedicated website (https://konsultacje.um.warszawa.pl)
extensive consultations with citizens and other stakeholders concerning documents programming the city's development and important projects affecting quality of life, such as: the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the City of Warsaw. Warsaw by 2030 with a perspective to 2050. The Municipal Adaptation Plan, Warsaw Spatial Planning Study, Clean Transport Zone, revitalisation programmes, Local Development Plans, etc.
Participation in developing the Green Vision for Warsaw (GCCAP). We've invited a wide range of stakeholders who had a significant impact on the final character of the document: representatives of NGOs, science, and businesses. Experts from various fields and residents of the capital were also involved in the work. More than 20 working meetings and workshops for external stakeholders took place, as well as dozens of sessions for internal stakeholders - municipal units and units responsible for implementing individual measures. Approx. 300 people participated in them. Residents of Warsaw had also the opportunity to submit their comments on the document via a virtual platform.
From 2020 to 2021, Warsaw organised the Warsaw Climate Panel, which was entrusted to non-governmental organisations selected in a competition, with 90 residents selected at random to decide on climate policy in the area of increasing Warsaw's energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy sources in the city's energy balance. The panel also included experts, representatives of NGOs and urban movements. Implementing the Panel's provisions is monitored by the Monitoring Team, which includes the social side.
For more than 10 years, Warsaw has includes the institution of the Citizen's Budget, a process in which the citizens of Warsaw decide what to spend part of the city budget on. They submit their ideas and then, in the way of voting, select those to be implemented by the Warsaw City Council.

For many years, the city has had a platform called Partnership for Climate, which brings together organisations and institutions representing a wide variety of backgrounds, including state and local government units, embassies, businesses, NGOs, and institutions committed to nature conservation and building a sustainable city. Members of the platform share knowledge, experiences, and carry out joint projects.

The PRINCIPLES we wish to follow in implementing the CCC are as follows:

![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

# A strong mandate and cooperation

In order to effectively implement the planned operations, they must include multi-level support and strong legitimacy. Therefore, the Climate City Contract, its implementation method, as well as the measures it stipulates will be subject to a consultation process not only at the preparation stage, but also during the stage of implementation and adjustments made under the influence of experience. The legitimacy must be multi-level: City Management, the Climate Team, the units, cells, and municipal companies involved in the implementation, a wide range of municipal stakeholders (entrepreneurs, academia, residents, institutions, organisations, associations, and urban movements, residents of mission districts), mission district councils and boards, representatives of the government and elected central offices. For this, we provide for a multi-stage arrangements process, depending on the subject matter and scope of the topic. Cooperation is also embedded in the multi-level management of the process.

# Compatibility and coherence

Actions implemented as part of the Climate Contract must be coherent with the strategic objectives and documents programming the city's development as well as other documents that define the
0

Warsaw

Commitments to climate neutrality by 2030

city's development policy, in particular the Green Vision for Warsaw. This will allow using the capital's resources optimally to achieve the CCC's goal and finding synergies in the city's activities in such a way that they support each other. Therefore, the Urban Climate Contact is perceived as a continuation of the activities described in the Green Vision for Warsaw: in a more detailed form, with more ambitious goals, but limited in scope to two districts. Compatibility will be ensured through a process of multi-level collaboration, both within the office and with municipal stakeholders and representatives from government and central offices. The implementation process also provides for an evaluation of selected municipal documents in terms of their compliance with the Climate City Contract.

## Transparency

Plans, activities, and process management must be public and knowledge concerning them easily accessible. Therefore, a website will be created for the CCC, where the content of the contract, reports from Transition Team meetings, monitoring results or activity reports, as well as other information about the process can be viewed. Residents will also be able to submit their needs and ideas, via the site. Apart from that, regular information meetings will be organised in the district taking part in the CCC, where urban stakeholders will be able to ask questions or make their requests and comments on the process. The results of Transition Team meetings will also be public, with reports published. The city's Public Consultation digital platform (https://konsultacje.um.warszawa.pl/) will be used for public consultation concerning climate contract measures.

## Continuous improvement

The Climate City Contract is an iterative process - a process of continuous prototyping. Therefore, a mechanism for permanent feedback concerning its progress and effects, as well as a process of monitoring based on concrete, measurable indicators, is crucial in it. The process must include frequent monitoring (twice a year) and evaluation, arrangements for ongoing feedback and knowledge of new solutions and innovations emerging on the market. Discussing the results of monitoring must always be concluded with conclusions and recommendations concerning the modification of the process with a view to improving it and making it more effective.

## PROCESS DESCRIPTION

The city cannot achieve the targets set in the CCC on its own, given that its units are only directly responsible for 7.5% of emissions. Achieving the 80% reduction target in the selected neighbourhoods will only be possible with the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders and gaining broad public acceptance, and that is why the implementation process involves the active participation of stakeholders at many levels. This process is based on bodies that already exist (Climate Team, Transition Team) or are currently being constituted (National Cooperation Platform). The activities carried out within the CCC will be coordinated by the Air Protection and Climate Policy Department, a unit established in the City of Warsaw to initiate and coordinate operations in favour of the climate.

Elements of multi-level process management:

An Internal Transition Team, made up of city officials, employees of city companies, and representatives of districts, will mainly deal with agreeing on the operational aspects of activities
Warsaw

O

and plans that require cross-sectoral coordination and cooperation, discussing their implementation and needed adjustments. The Internal Transition Team will also commission analyses concerning the impact of individual measures on various aspects of the city's functioning, particularly in terms of a just climate transition and the impact on residents' health and well-being. It will also cooperate with the External Transition Team within the framework of sectoral cooperation (concerning transport, energy, buildings, etc.).

The External Transition Team, composed additionally of city stakeholders (contract signatories and other interested representatives from business, science, civil society, and public institutions) will be in charge of: agreeing on sectoral activities and priorities, determining the field of cooperation, the contribution of individual stakeholders to the action, responsibilities and methods for verifying the effectiveness of the action, discussing the degree of implementation of the action, and needed adjustments.

Due to the large number of stakeholders, meetings focusing on specific sectors (buildings, energy, transport, etc.), among stakeholders involved in the sector, will be most appropriate. The External Transition Team will be able to set up working groups of selected stakeholders to work on developing new solutions (technical, organisational, funding, etc.), problem solving or project groups. It will also constitute a forum where stakeholders can share their knowledge, experiences, solutions and invite experts from specific fields with knowledge that can support particular activities or the CCC process itself.

Programme Board - will meet periodically. These will consist of meetings of the entire Transition Team, with the participation of representatives of the boards of the districts implementing the climate contract and of the district councils, representatives of the government and central institutions, representatives of regional authorities, with the possibility of residents' participation. It will discuss crucial action plans and priorities, analyse the workflow and monitoring results, identify the needed directional changes, discuss proposals, as well as identify barriers and needs. The Board will also recommend the need to update the Climate City Contract.

Cooperation with the Polish cities of the Mission - Krakow, Lodz, Rzeszow and Wroclaw. This cooperation has resulted in a number of solutions that take into account the nationwide specifics. It has also resulted in cooperation with authorities at the national level, including individual ministries

National Cooperation Platform - bringing together representatives of the cities participating in the EC Mission and representatives of the Polish government, mainly ministries that are signatories to the CCC. Its aim is to discuss the manners of the needed support (legislative, financial, technical, etc.) and the necessary interventions at the national level to enable the CCC to be implemented and potential barriers to be addressed.

Climate Team - the results of monitoring the implementation of the Climate City Contract will be presented to the Climate Team. Key implementation findings and needs to support the implementation of activities or adjustments of activities at the strategic level (including CCC updates) will also be addressed to the team. The team will issue recommendations to the City Board concerning the mobilisation of additional resources or actions to facilitate, streamline contract implementation, and deal with identified barriers.

Reports concerning the progress in implementing the Climate City Contract will also be reported periodically to the City Board and Warsaw City Council.

# 5 Signatories

The table below lists the signatories who join this Climate City Contract and thus to help the city reach its goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 in the two designated districts of Praga-Południe and Ursynów. Annex 1 adds detailed contracts/agreements/letters of intent that set out the details of the declared pro-climate actions between the city and the signatories (see example in section 6). The number and significance of signatory commitments is likely to increase over time.

In the first stage, we start with the key stakeholders who have been invited to sign the CCC because of: the contribution they may bring to the planned activities, the need to develop all the key sectors for implementing the contract or because of the level of their own emissions. When implementing the Climate City Contract, we will gradually increase the number of signatories.

Contracts of the City of Warsaw are concluded on three levels:

A BASIC partnership, in terms of which a stakeholder signs a letter of intent expressing support for the objectives of the Climate City Contract and the actions of the City of Warsaw as well as a general declaration of substantive and organisational support for the Praga-Południe and Ursynów districts in their efforts to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.
A FRAMEWORK partnership in which the stakeholder expresses support for the aspirations of the districts of Praga-Południe and Ursynów to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and declares a concrete contribution to the activities related to implementing the Climate City Contract of the City of Warsaw.
A PREMIUM Partnership: in which the stakeholder expresses support for the aspirations of the districts of Praga-Południe and Ursynów to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, pledges to contribute to activities related to implementing the Climate City Contract by the City of Warsaw and commits to taking concrete steps towards achieving its own climate neutrality by 2030.

The Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the city of Warsaw by 2030 with the prospects until 2050 Urban Adaptation Plan has been developed through the concerted effort of Warsaw residents, entrepreneurs, representatives of various organisations, and the City of Warsaw authorities.

Warsaw, 4th July 2019
Dear Reader,

Climate change affects most European cities, including Warsaw. For the sake of residents' safety, we must be prepared for extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts or heavy rains, which are more and more frequent. For this purpose, the Urban Adaptation Plan was created. The strategic document will set the directions for the spatial development and the budget of the city. It is not only a theory, but real actions that strengthen the city's resilience. Implementation of the Plan will positively affect the quality of life of Warsaw residents - provide a sense of comfort and protect their health.

Can cities play an important role in the fight against global warming? Certainly Yes! It is important to invest in public transport, renewable energy sources, improve energy efficiency and air quality, greening the city and save water resources. Thinking about future steps, we all have to look through the climate lens and raise awareness. We also have to take care of nature, because we are a part of it.

# INTRODUCTION

Big cities today are already experiencing the effects of the climate change which affect many aspects of their functioning. Intense urbanization and high population density, decrease in the share of biologically active area and hence reduced potential of rainwater retention, all that reinforces the consequences of these changes. On top of that, there are extreme weather events, such as heavy precipitation, rainstorms or floods. Heat waves and droughts cause a lot of material and immaterial damage and pose direct risk to human health and life.

The subject of climate change has been treated very seriously in Warsaw for many years. In 2008 the Climate Protection Team was appointed with one of the objectives: to inspire and launch activities mitigating climate change impacts by reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly, carbon dioxide. As a result of this action, in 2009 Warsaw joined the European initiative The Covenant of Mayors, and in 2011 Sustainable Energy Action Plan for Warsaw in the perspective of 2020¹, and then in 2015, the Warsaw Low Carbon Economy Plan² were adopted. The preparation of the Adaptation Strategy constitutes the next, natural step in the implementation of the City's climate policy. This document sets the action lines consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals³, especially with Goal

Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, and Goal 13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

The best tools of modern climatology – the hydrodynamic climate models – have been used to carry out the analyses and prepare forecasts concerning the climate changes that will take place in the Warsaw agglomeration in the 21st century. The results suggest that the climate in Warsaw will be significantly warmer in future. So much so, that it will transfer us all into a yet unknown climate zone. The temperature growth trends are visible in all the analysed thermal characteristics. The simulations also point to an increase in both average and maximum precipitation levels, while at the same time they do not forecast any substantial changes regarding periods without precipitation.

Therefore it has become necessary to assess which groups of residents and which sectors of the city life are exposed to climate change. Such an assessment makes it easier to take decisions about the lines of action and investment outlays which can prevent huge financial losses or threats to the life and health of the city residents. Public participation is one of the main success factors in the implementation of individual measures and in adapting them to the residents' needs. It will also help to involve the residents, from the very beginning, in the protective actions, which will result in more rational and informed behaviour in case of threat and, in addition, will increase their safety. Finding the

right solutions will also have positive impact on various elements of the infrastructure thus improving the comfort of living in the city.

Climate change adaptation action entails substantial expenditure, which should be seen in relation to the level of losses incurred during undesirable weather events. With the awareness growing as a result of the availability of climate change forecasts, it is possible to undertake action to prevent or mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. Thus it is possible to avoid damage caused by extreme weather events whose cost would be disproportionately high compared to the cost of preventive action. It should also be noted that adaptation action creates a new market for innovative solutions, improving the standing of the city in Poland and in Europe. It is expected that, in the nearest future, there will be a significant increase in the use of funds for adaptation-related projects. The European Union, taking notice of this trend and the need for protection against the negative consequences of climate change, has included expenses related to such actions in its policies. This funding will only be available to the local government authorities that have the relevant strategic documents in place.

Adaptation and mitigation actions must be implemented simultaneously, while the resources available in the city must be used in a rational manner. Integration of those actions will help to improve the condition of the environment, the quality of the urban space and to raise the climate policy awareness of the city residents, thus influencing the quality of our life and that of the future generations.

# 1. FACTORS DETERMINING THE PREPARATION OF THE DOCUMENT

## 1.1. FORMAL CONSIDERATIONS

Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the city of Warsaw is consistent with the EU commitments of Poland regarding adaptation to climate change. On 29 October 2013, the Council of Ministers adopted the document „Strategic adaptation plan for sectors and areas vulnerable to climate change by 2020 with the prospects until 2030" (SPA 2020), which „... was prepared with the aim to provide conditions for stable social and economic development in the context of the risks posed by climate change, but also to take advantage of the positive effect that the adaptation actions may have not only on the condition of the environment in Poland, but also on the economic growth."

Since urban areas are the ones where negative impacts of the climate change will be the strongest, in January 2017 the Ministry of Environment launched a two-year project evaluating the vulnerability to climate change of the biggest Polish cities and planning adaptation measures appropriate to the identified threats, reflected in the Urban Adaptation Plan of individual cities.

Warsaw was not part of the ministerial project because the preparation of the documents programming the development of the city, taking into account the climate risk, had begun 2.5 years earlier. The project entitled „Preparation of a climate change adaptation strategy for the city of Warsaw, with the use of city climate mapping and with public participation", in short, ADAPTCITY, of which this document is the most important deliverable, was launched on 1 July 2014.

## 1.2. CLIMATIC CONDITIONS

Climate change, that is, the process of climate warming, is already taking place and will continue. The forecasts of the Fifth Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC⁵) show that Poland will experience the highest increase in temperature among the countries of our region - together with countries such as Sweden, Latvia and Lithuania. The occurrence of very high temperatures can increase the death rate, particularly in big cities, exposed to the so called urban heat island effect. In the period 1750 - 2013, the average annual temperature in Warsaw rose by almost 2°C, and, according to the two climate change scenarios developed for the purpose of this report, by the end of the century, depending on the action taken, it can grow by 3.5°C to 5°C.

Both the findings of UN Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change studies as well as the KLIMADA⁶ project, predict that Poland will experience a significant increase in the frequency/intensity of heat waves, occurrence of droughts, the number and intensity of floods, heavy rainfalls and strong winds. The analyses conducted for the purpose of this document have shown that Warsaw is exposed to the same threats. This is an important reason to undertake action to adapt to climate change.

At the same time, the Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change concerning the reduction of the global rise in temperature to $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}^7$ emphasizes that at present, the level of global warming has risen by about $1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ compared to the pre-industrial era, while it is possible to avoid long-term and irreversible negative impacts of climate change by limiting the increase in the average global temperature to not more than $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Any warming of the climate higher than $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ increases the risk of long-term or irreversible changes. According to the report of the World Meteorological Organization, the year 2018 was one of the warmest years on record (that is, from the 19th century). In spite of the Agreement concluded at the Climate Summit in Paris in 2015, world greenhouse gas emissions are still growing (e.g., between 2017 and 2018 they increased by $1.6\%$), whereas according to the above mentioned Special Report, by 2030 they should fall by $45\%$ compared to the 2010 levels.

With the continuing climate change, it is important to manage the climate risk properly. This is made possible by providing appropriate tools, especially to the local government. Such tools will help improve the adaptability of households, enterprises, public institutions, civil society organisations as well as individual residents. They will also help increase awareness, build up knowledge and share information and will influence the ability to implement measures that enhance the resilience of the city and its infrastructure, enabling it to avoid damage and to restore proper operation of the city functions, both with respect to the residents and the economy, if any negative consequences of climate change occur.

The most important objective of the measures adapting Warsaw to climate change is to improve the safety of its residents, exposed directly or indirectly to weather extremes and their effects. These measures should focus on protecting the city against the consequences of extreme weather events and on mitigating their impact, such as losses caused by flooding and heavy rains, increase in the mortality rate caused by heat waves, decline in the diversity of the ecosystems providing services to the city and its residents.

There are numerous analyses focusing on the economic rationale for adaptation to climate change. They all indicate that failure to take appropriate action will lead to the generation of inaction costs, that is, costs that may arise as a result of future damage, which will be considerably higher, both economically and socially, than the costs the adaptation measures$^8$.

According to the Green Paper on Insurance of Natural and Man-made Disaster$^9$ in the initial period of adaptation, focused on management issues, one should expect growth in the economy and in employment. The second phase should contribute to the reduction of losses associated with extreme weather events. The third phase means a high rate of return on the investments made.

Adaptation to climate change is a process which definitely enhances the competitiveness of the city, improves the quality of life and healthcare, helps create attractive and safe spaces, improves the level of environmental protection and creates demand for modern technologies and jobs.

# 2. INFORMATION ABOUT THE DOCUMENT – WORKS FORMAT

The city of Warsaw began the work on preparing the documents programming the development of the city while taking account of the climate risk, on 1 July 2014, with the accession to the ADAPTCITY project. The Project made it possible to have a number of expert analyses carried out and to secure the broad stakeholders' commitment. The structure of the document follows the guidelines of the Ministry of the Environment for preparing documents of this type¹⁰.

This document, the “Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the city of Warsaw by 2030, with the prospects until 2050. Urban Adaptation Plan” defines the city’s policy¹¹ aimed at preparing and adapting Warsaw to the progressing climate change.

¹¹ The document plays the role of a policy document for the Strategy #Warszawa2030 and sets the rules and guidelines for the urban climate change adaptation programmes, in accordance with the Regulation No. 1868/2017 of the Mayor of Warsaw dated 5 December 2017 on introducing standard documents programming the development of the city of Warsaw.
The work on the Adaptation Strategy began with the Team working on the document getting acquainted with the good practices applied in Stuttgart, a partner of the ADAPTCITY Project. Drawing from the experience of the German partner, after conducting a number of studies and analyses, the Committee of Scientific Consultants developed the Warsaw Climatic Atlas¹². The work on the maps was conducted by scientists from the Faculty of Geography and Regional Studies of the Warsaw University, with the participation of the Warsaw University Interdisciplinary Centre of Mathematical Modelling. The Atlas comprises maps which provide a lot of valuable information, showing the threats that the city may face. They present the occurrence of various weather events in Warsaw in recent years, including precipitation, a rise in temperature, storms or strong winds, as well as a list of scenarios predicting what pattern they may form as a result of climate change by the end of the 21st century. They show the risk of the occurrence of heat waves, harsh frosts, severe precipitation, heat island effects appearing in different places in the city.

The development of the Adaptation Strategy has been a multistage process, conducted with the broad participation of the public. The document is the effect of the cooperation between the residents of Warsaw, representatives of civil society organisations, entrepreneurs, a team of scientists and experts and the city authorities. The participation process began in September 2016, when the first of six meetings of the Warsaw Round Table for Adaptation to Climate Change (WOSAK)¹³ was held. WOSAK's work was completed in January 2017 with the drafting of the Assumptions to the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the city of Warsaw by 2030 with the prospects until 2050¹⁴. That document was the subject of public consultation¹⁵ conducted between February and June 2017. The problems related to climate change were discussed with the residents of the city at 18 meetings and during outdoor family picnics. Groups of professionals were also invited to debate (teachers, healthcare sector, services responsible for security and crisis management and the institutions in charge of the broadly understood water management) as were City Bureaus and organisational units of the Warsaw City Hall. This activity resulted in the preparation of the document "Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the city of Warsaw by 2030 with the prospects until 2050. Urban Adaptation Plan", submitted to the people of Warsaw for consultation¹⁶ in February-March 2019.

After collecting the opinions and examining the list of problems, the final draft of the Adaptation Strategy was prepared, taking account of the entirety of the issues related to adapting Warsaw to climate change. The document describes the main threats resulting from climate change and the related risk areas that may affect Warsaw and its residents. It also proposes the lines of action needed to protect us against the negative impacts of the climate change-related phenomena.

# 3. DIAGNOSIS

# 3.1. CLIMATE OF WARSAW AND ITS EXPECTED CHANGES

The geographical location makes the climate of Warsaw a result of the combined impact of humid and mild sea air, dry and harsh continental air and icy cold Arctic air or hot Mediterranean air (transitional climate). This means that these four different air masses move over the city, changing with great frequency, and as a result, the weather is extremely variable.

Throughout almost entire 20th century, the climatic conditions of Warsaw were the following:

The average annual temperature for individual years in this period ranged from 7oC to 8oC. Within a year, the lowest temperatures were noted in January, the highest – in July. The average number of hot days during the year (with average temperature above 25oC) was about 40.
The annual precipitation was approx. 520 mm, the highest monthly precipitation was noted in July, the lowest – in February.
Snow coverage was present for 50 to 60 days in a year with 33 freezing days (average temperature below 0oC).
Average wind speed in the city was approx. 4 m/s.

![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)
Fig. 2 Average temperature in Warsaw in the period 1750 - 2013 and possible change scenarios

Moderate scenario, labelled as RCP 4,5, that is, representative GHGs concentration pathway (RPC) leading to radiative forcing (an alteration in the radiative equilibrium in the Earth's atmosphere connected with a distortion in the climate system) at the level of  $4.5\mathrm{W / m2}$ . For such a scenario to occur it will be necessary to reduce the use of energy, to halt the changes in land use, to increase the share of forested areas and deploy carbon capture and storage technologies.

High concentration scenario labelled as RCP8,5 that is, representative GHGs concentration pathway (RPC) leading to radiative forcing (an alteration in the radiative equilibrium in the Earth's atmosphere connected with a distortion in the climate system) at the level of  $8.5\mathrm{W / m2}$ . This "business as usual" scenario means that nothing will change in the functioning of the city. The population will increase significantly while the income will rise relatively slowly, changes in technology and improvement of energy efficiency will be rather modest, leading, in the long term, to high demand for energy and high emission of greenhouse gases not accompanied by any policy addressing climate change.

Already at the end of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century these conditions have changed. The following has been observed since the 1990s:

An increase in the average annual temperature. The average annual temperature in the city has already exceeded 80C and in the central parts of the city – even 100C. The increase in temperature can be blamed on both, the so called urban heat island effect and the global climate warming.
Shorter periods with snow coverage and a greater number of hot days. A decrease in the number of freezing days has not been observed. There have been more sudden and heavy rainfalls in the summer.

The observations and studies conducted in the years 1981 – 2014 have made it possible to describe the key phenomena connected with climate which have negative impact on the city and its residents.

Increase in air temperature and thus an increase in the number and intensity of very hot days.

In the period 1981 – 2014, an annual increase was observed in the number of hot days and tropical nights (according to the scenarios applied by the IPCC, adapted for the purpose of assessing the changes in the climate of Warsaw, this increase will be progressing (Fig. 3., Fig. 4.). This leads to a greater demand for cooling in summer and therefore potential shortage of energy, possible deterioration of air quality (occurrence of smog in summer - photochemical smog), deepening of the urban heat island effect (Fig. 5.), increased demand for water or direct threat to the lives of the residents. Those most vulnerable to the risks associated with high air temperature and

solar exposure are mainly elderly people (over 65 years of age), young children, people suffering from respiratory system and cardio-vascular diseases, people with disabilities, especially with reduced mobility, as well as the homeless¹⁹

# 2. Increase in the frequency and intensity of precipitation causing local flooding

The period under analysis, the years 1981 - 2013 was marked by a statistically significant increase in annual precipitation, mainly in the southern part of Warsaw. The number of days with high precipitation (above  $10\mathrm{mm}$  of water/m2) increased and growing single rainfall levels (over  $90\mathrm{mm}$  of water /m2) were observed. It is expected that this trend, according to the climate change scenarios for the city, will continue. First of all, the number of short-time rainfalls with high intensity, causing local flooding will grow (Fig. 6., Fig. 7.). This will lead not only to transport difficulties but will also pose a threat to property and lives of the people who will find themselves within the reach of the quickly rising waters.

Increase in the intensity and scale of flooding or drought

In the years 2008 - 2014, in Warsaw, dry periods prevailed, but the rainy periods occurring between them had unprecedented intense nature. According to forecasts, we should expect an increase in the frequency of extreme events such as floods. The above is confirmed by the results of the KLIMADA project, which concludes that as a result of climate change, in the coming years, the number of floods will increase.

In 2010, the flood wave moved through Warsaw twice in rapid succession (in May and June). Another similar event, albeit on a smaller scale, took place in 2012. The levees along the Vistula River protect the city from a 1-in-100 year flood wave (Table 1). It is, however, anticipated that such flooding might occur more than once in a century, although the anticipation is based on historical data, and not only on analyses of future climate changes. Locally, also smaller water courses within the city limits may pose a threat, such as Bródnowski Canal, the Długa River or the Służewiecki Brook, whose swelling waters can be even more troublesome because of the increasing scale of single extreme rainfalls.

# 4. Increased intensity of storms and strong winds

The number of days with strong wind and the average wind speed throughout the year decreased in the years 1981 - 2013. However, isolated episodes of hurricane wind in the city led to ever more dangerous effects. They had been brought by increasingly deeper low-pressure systems flowing over Poland from the Atlantic. Combined with violent storms, strong wind always brought serious negative impacts on the city: disruptions of power supply, fallen trees, disruptions in transport services as well as fatalities. At present, there are no reliable predictions as to changes in the intensity of storms and strong winds by the end of the 21st century. Some positive phenomena that

may occur as a result of the predicted climate change should also be brought to attention.

Higher air temperature, both within the urban heat island and as a result of the overall change of the climate may lead to the following:

Decrease in the number of days with snowfall and thus to shortening the periods with snow cover,
Extending the plant growing season,
Shortening of the heating period.

However, it must be remembered that the threats resulting from climate change are disproportionately higher than the benefits.

## 3.2. TOWS ANALYSIS²⁰

The diagnosis of the status of climate change and Warsaw's options to adapt to them has the structure of TOWS analysis, while its individual elements bear their own names derived from the nature of the conducted analyses²¹.

First, the Exposure Analysis was performed, which constituted the Analysis of climate threats. Further analyses were conducted only with reference to the threats identified at this stage. Opportunities (that is, reduction of the scale of the threats), resulting from the exposure analysis, were taken into account only at the stage of developing the actions on the basis of the entire analysis.

²⁰ The English abbreviation SWOT reads as: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. The SWOT analysis is carried out by analysing the factors described by the letters of the acronym, from the strengths through to threats. TOWS means an analysis of the same elements carried out in the reversed order, from threats through to strengths.

²¹ Names of the analyses have been adopted following the Podręcznik adaptacji dla miast – wytyczne do przygotowania Miejskiego Planu Adaptacji do zmian klimatu, Ministerstwo Środowiska, 2014 [Adaptation Manual for Cities – guideline for preparing an Urban Climate Change Adaptation Plan, Ministry of Environment 2014].

During the Vulnerability Analysis, based on the assessment of the potential occurrence of negative and positive impacts on the city (people, built-up areas including technical infrastructure and the natural environment, together with green and blue infrastructure) as a result of climate change threats (flood events, flooding, heat waves, droughts, violent storms, strong winds), the vulnerability of the city to climate change was estimated.

This was followed by the Adaptability Analysis, which assessed the characteristics of the city and the actions that the urban community can take or is prepared to take in case of extreme weather events and other negative effects of climate change, which consequently help to withstand these adverse phenomena.

The next step was the Susceptibility Analysis - analysis of interdependencies between elements of the TOWS analysis. In particular, this analysis sought answers to the questions of how adaptability affects the reduction of vulnerability (resilience as

sessment) and how the scale of climate threats affects the city's resilience level (susceptibility assessment). The extent to which the city is unable to cope with the negative impacts of climate change or seize the opportunities associated with climate change has been determined. Susceptibility is a function of the type, intensity, scale and speed of the changes to which a city is exposed, its vulnerability and adaptability.

## 3.2.1. Exposure Analysis
(analysis of climate threats and opportunities)

![img-28.jpeg](img-28.jpeg)

In the analysis of the city's exposure, a number of climate factors have been taken into account, analysed on the basis of data from the years 1981 – 2014, including the following:

Average air temperature,
Extreme above-zero temperature,
Extreme sub-zero temperature,
solar radiation,
anual precipitation,
heavy rainfalls,
snowfall and snow buildup,
humidity,
average wind speed,
maximum wind speed,
tornadoes and whirlwinds,
storms (lightning),
drought,
floods,
growing season,

and the current level of exposure has been determined using a three-grade scale: high, medium, low.

Possible directions of changes in these climate factors were analysed, taking into account the analysis of climate change scenarios for Warsaw. The trend of the change had an impact on the raising or lowering of the current assessment
Exposure to climatic factors

|  Factor | Scale of phenomenon | Probability of occurrence during a year – so far | Exposure so far | Climate change by 2050 | Future exposure  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Average air temperature | 8,6-8,8 °C | n/a, whole year | Low | Increase by 1-2 oC | Low  |
|  Annual precipitation | 520-540mm | n/a, whole year | Low | Increase by 3-5% | Low  |
|  Average wind speed | 4,3-4,4 m/s | n/a, whole year | Low | Lower average speed | Low  |
|  Humidity | 78-80% | n/a, whole year | Low | No change or decrease by 0,5% | Low  |
|  Solar radiation | 1600-1700 hours | 18-19% | Low | No change or decrease | Low  |
|  Tornadoes and whirlwinds | 0 | <1% | Low | No change | Low  |
|  Plant growing season | 210-220 days | 60% | Low | Extension by 10-20 days | Low  |

|  Extreme sub-zero temperature | <-10 oC, 14 days per year | 4% | Medium | Decrease by 5-10 days | Low  |
|  Heavy rainfall | Heavy rainfall above 10mm approx. 13 days per year | 3,50% | Medium | Increase by 7-8 days, higher maximum level of precipitation | High  |
|  Snowfall and snow buildup | 50 to 60 days per year with snow coverage | 15% (snow coverage) | Medium | Fewer days with snow coverage | Low  |
|  Drought | Dry periods exceeding 20 days - 2 times a year | 10-11% | Medium | No change in no. of days | Medium  |
|  Maximum wind speed | Wind speed >10m/s | do 30% | Medium | No change or slight decrease | Medium  |
|  Storms (lightning) | Number of storms per year – approx. 30 | 8% | Low | Increase in number and strength | Low  |
|  Floods | 1-in-100, 1-in-500 or 1-in-1000-year flood | 1% | High | Increase in number | High  |

# HIGH AND MEDIUM EXPOSURE

Future high exposure for the following climate factors:

extreme above-zero temperature – the period in which such temperatures occur may significantly extend, increasing the number of events such as very hot days, tropical nights and the related negative effects on people's health;
heavy rainfalls – both the volume of a single rainfall may increase as well as the number of days with high precipitation which have so far caused severe losses in the city because of flooding;
floods – there may be an increase in the number of events involving high water level in the Vistula River or its tributaries located within the city limits; the high water level may increase further.

Future medium exposure for the following climate factors:

droughts (dry periods) – the length of periods without precipitation may remain the same but the severity of droughts will increase because of the increasing average and maximum air temperatures and the variability of the precipitation characteristics;
strong wind – episodes of strong wind have so far brought seasonal problems for the functioning of the city; this should essentially not change, the strength of the wind and the number of strong wind periods should not change, either.

# LOW EXPOSURE

For the following climate factors the exposure will fall to low:

extreme sub-zero temperatures – the current medium exposure of the city has been replaced with low exposure in this respect because the number of such days may decrease even by half, below the number of days with extreme above-zero temperature;
snowfall and snow build-up – the current medium level of exposure has been replaced with low exposure in this respect, because together with the decrease in the number of days with low temperature, the number of snowfalls and the period with snow coverage will decrease from several dozen to just several days in a year.

Further analyses take into account the climate threats to which the city's exposure will be medium or high.

# 3.2.2. Analysis of vulnerability and adaptability

![img-29.jpeg](img-29.jpeg)

The analyses focus on the city characteristics from the point of view of climate change, namely its vulnerability and adaptability²². Vulnerability is a set of city's weaknesses, adaptability is its strength. Their assessment has been based on the assumption that a specific climate threat identified in the exposure analysis occurs.

During the works, a set of climate maps of Warsaw was prepared, presenting both the diversity of the city's climate components as well as the elements related to its vulnerability²³.

A number of city's features have impact on its vulnerability to climate change and its adaptation capability. Starting from the location, which is determined by the natural factors, from the landform features, the character of the natural vegetation, through the quality of soils or geological formations to be found in the ground, the quality of hydrographic (river) network, to man-made factors such as density, height and other properties of buildings, availability of municipal infrastructure, modifications to the terrain, plant cover, hydrographic network and others. The man himself, or rather the features of the population living in a given city, is also an element of the city's vulnerability. These may be people who are well informed, aware of the risks and acting responsibly in the face of a threat, or those who are unaware and unable to cope with crisis situations.

In order to assess these two elements which constitute Warsaw's specific characteristics in the face of climate change, i.e. its vulnerability and adaptability, the most important facts about the city were reviewed and divided into strengths demonstrating the adaptability of Warsaw and weaknesses demonstrating its vulnerability.

²² In accordance with Podręcznik adaptacji dla miast – wytyczne do przygotowania Miejskiego Planu Adaptacji do zmian klimatu, Ministry of Environment, 2014.

²³ More to be found on the website adaptcity.pl and in section ADAPTCITY on the website mapa.um.warszawa.pl
Then, the strengths and the weaknesses were analysed by sector:

human health and healthcare system,
crisis management system
public awareness,
transport and communications,
buildings and other enclosed structures,

agriculture and forestry,
Warsaw's nature system,
energy sector,
water and wastewater management,
waste management.

## HIGH VULNERABILITY

The highest vulnerability has been identified for the following sectors:

health, buildings and network facilities, nature system and energy sector (energy supply) – in case of heat waves;
public awareness, transport and communications infrastructure, buildings and water management – in case of heavy rainfall events (flooding);
crisis management, transport and communications as well as buildings and network facilities – in case of floods;
public awareness and agriculture and forestry as well as the city's nature system – in case of drought;
public awareness, crisis management system and the city's nature system – in case of strong winds.

## HIGH ADAPTABILITY

The highest level of adaptability has been identified for the following sectors:

transport and communications, the city's nature system and the energy sector – in case of heat waves;
health, agriculture and forestry, the city's nature system and waste management – in case of flooding;
crisis management, buildings and network facilities, nature system and water management – in case of floods;
human health, crisis management and the energy sector – in case of drought;
construction sector and network facilities – in case of strong winds.

## 3.2.3. Susceptibility Analysis

The next step was to show the interdependencies between the elements of the climate change TOWS analysis carried out for Warsaw.

It is not sufficient to determine the level of adaptability and vulnerability in case of threat for selected sectors. It is also required to examine to what extent the sectors' adaptability reduces their vulnerability level and then how these factors depend on the actual scale of climate threats. Revealing these interdependencies is the subject of the susceptibility analysis.

![img-30.jpeg](img-30.jpeg)

## Resilience assessment

The first part of the susceptibility analysis is the resilience assessment. Resilience is the difference between the vulnerability and the adaptability assessments. The resilience was low when high vulnerability was linked with low or medium adaptability. The resilience was described as medium when the levels vulnerability and adaptability were similar. The resilience was assessed as high when the level of adaptability was much higher than vulnerability.

In order to create proper conditions for adapting Warsaw to climate change it is necessary to increase the city's adaptability and to reduce its vulnerability to the threats in the sectors where the diagnosis indicated low resilience.

## RESILIENCE ASSESSMENT LOW

The low resilience diagnosis has been given for the following sectors:

public awareness – with respect to high temperatures, rainfall and floods;
transport and communications – with respect to rainfall, floods and strong winds;
construction sector – with respect to high temperatures, rainfall and floods;
nature system – in case of high temperatures, drought and strong winds;
health and crisis management – in case of high temperatures;
water and wastewater management – in case of heavy precipitation;
agriculture and forestry – in case of drought.

# Susceptibility assessment

![img-31.jpeg](img-31.jpeg)
Susceptibility assessment

In order to produce an overall assessment related to the adaptation of Warsaw to climate change, the relationship between the city's exposure to climate change (threats) and its resilience (strengths and weaknesses) was analysed for individual sectors. These interdependencies constitute the susceptibility assessment.

The susceptibility assessment is a function of resilience assessment and exposure assessment. Susceptibility is high where high exposure coincides with low or medium resilience to a given threat. Susceptibility is described as medium if the exposure to a threat is at medium level and the resilience is medium or high. Susceptibility is low when the exposure level is low and resilience is high.

The susceptibility assessment for Warsaw has been made with respect to the threats the exposure to which has been assessed as medium (strong winds and drought) or high (floods, extreme temperature levels and rainfall). As a result of the analyses it has been established that for Warsaw to be able to adapt to climate change it is necessary to increase its resilience in the sectors where susceptibility to a given threat has been assessed as high.

# SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT

## HIGH

The high susceptibility diagnosis has been given for the following sectors:

residents' awareness, transport and communications and construction sector – with respect to high temperatures, rainfall, floods and strong winds;
nature system – with respect to high temperatures, floods, drought and strong winds;
agriculture and forestry – in case of high temperatures, drought, precipitation and strong winds;
crisis management – with respect to high temperature, rainfall and floods;
health and energy sector – with respect to high temperatures, floods and strong winds;
water and wastewater management – in case of floods and rainfall.

## 3.2.4. Risk Analysis

![img-32.jpeg](img-32.jpeg)
Risk Analysis

In the process of adapting Warsaw to climate change it is necessary to build the resilience to the identified threats, in particular for the sectors with high susceptibility. In order to ensure that the resilience is developed in a responsible manner, a risk analysis has been carried out to determine the scale and the probability of the negative impacts that the identified threats may bring. The analysis has shown which adaptation measures should be undertaken in the first place so as to avoid the most probable negative effects. Prevention and protection of the city against the most probable impacts should be treated as the most urgent, priority issue to address.

During the work, the sectors where divided into the following areas:

Human life and health – sectors: healthcare system, crisis management and public awareness;
Elements of technical infrastructure – sectors: construction, transport and communications;
Green and blue infrastructure – sectors: agriculture and forestry and the Warsaw's nature system;
Supplies of utilities for the city – sectors: energy, water management, waste management

For these areas the analysis was conducted concerning 5 most important threats identified during the exposure analysis, that is, heatwaves, flooding, flood events, droughts and strong winds.

## THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOLLOWING THREAT IMPACTS:

Higher mortality or damage to health suffered by a number of people as a result of heatwaves;
Single deaths and people harmed as a result of strong winds;
Area-specific disruptions to the functioning of technical infrastructure and disruptions in utilities supply as a result of floods;
Technical infrastructure failures as a result of heatwaves, flooding or strong winds;
Spot damage to green infrastructure or small damage in larger areas of the city as a result of flood, drought or strong winds;
Small spot damage to green and blue infrastructure as a result of flooding.

# 3.3. PRIORITY AREAS

Risk analysis by sector is not sufficient for a city covering a large area, such as Warsaw. It has been established that threats significant in one part of the city are not so important in another part. This applies, for instance, to the flood risk which covers about 25% of Warsaw's area whereas on the remaining area it is not very significant. It is expected that part of the adaptation measures will have to be implemented as a reaction to or protection against specific impacts occurring as a result of flooding, flood risk or occurrence of urban heat island effect. The risk analysis has been conducted on the basis of the assessment of the key climate change threats, thermal and hydrological (Fig. 9).

The threats²⁴ are spatially diversified, which is connected with density of development, landform, distance from water courses, etc. The biggest threats appear in densely built-up areas, situated relatively close to the Vistula riverbed – in the southern part of Praga-Pólnoc and in the western part of Praga-Południe, in Żoliborz as well as in the eastern part of Mokotów, where there is a synergy between thermal and hydrological threats (mainly flood-related). The second area with high scale climate threats is Green Ursynów (the area west of the Puławska Street and the edge of the Kabaty Woods up to the border of the district), where hydrological threat is related to the risk of flooding after heavy rains and springtime snowmelt. The Vistula river valley stands out as an area of high hydrological threat but low thermal threat, which is connected with the impact of surface water on the local climate, reducing the thermal contrasts

In the western districts (Bemowo, Wola, Bielany, Włochy) there are small areas with high thermal threat (resulting from the high influx of solar energy converted into heat, the so called active surface) and low level of hydrological threat. In the districts with lower density of development and substantial share of green areas (part of Wawer, Wesoła, Białołęka) there are moderate climate threats, connected with the relatively low albedo of the active surface and no significant hydrological threat. More than 25% of the area of Warsaw lies within the zone of high thermal threat and moderate hydrological threat (for instance Targówek, northern part of Praga-Pólnoc, Śródmieście, Ochota, Wola, Mokotów,

²⁴ The studies prepared for the purposes of the ADAPTCITY Project made it possible to carry out an overall assessment of the scale of thermal and hydrological threats. For each threat three classes were distinguished. Their combination resulted in showing the cumulative threat on a five-grade scale, from the highest to the very low threat. The list of studies used to make this assessment is included in the Bibliography.
Ursus). The thermal threat is connected mainly with the type of land cover and high temperature of the active surface; the hydrological threat – with the risk of local flooding as a result of heavy rainfall events. The areas with low climate threats are situated mainly on the outskirts of the city suburbs, surrounded by green spaces, with low-rise and dispersed development.

Taking into account the basic information about the exposure to climate threats²⁵ and the combination of thermal and hydrological threats, it is possible to describe the climate threat exposure by districts, divided into five groups.

![img-34.jpeg](img-34.jpeg)

²⁵ 14 types of climate threat information were analysed: impermeability, density of development, share of built-up and urbanized areas, albedo, greenspaces quality indicator, average temperature, coverage with biologically active surfaces, flood risk, number of warm nights, threat of local flooding, periods without precipitation, increase in the number of housing units, urban heat island effect and the share of greenspaces and forests. Then, an integrated classification was prepared for individual districts, dividing the climate threat into five categories, from the highest to the lowest.
I. GROUP WITH MODERATE CLIMATE THREAT (194.9 KM2, 37.7% OF THE CITY AREA).

This Group includes the following districts: Wesola, Rembertów, Wawer and Białołęka.

## Wesola

This is a district with a substantial share of green spaces and forests. No significant increase the number of housing units is foreseen in these areas by 2030. At present and in future there are and will be a lot of permeable areas and the density of development is and will be low. The biggest threat is and will be posed by heavy rains that may cause local flooding. The district is situated outside the Warsaw's urban heat island. However, the fact that it is surrounded by coniferous forests, often growing on sandy soil, may be conducive to local, significant rise in temperature. The occurrence of at least two-week periods without rain that is twice as frequent in this district as in other parts of the city, may lead to plant wilting and breakouts and spreading of dangerous forest fires.

## Rembertów

This is a district with a substantial share of green spaces and forests. No significant increase in the number of housing units is foreseen in these areas by 2030. At present and in future there are and will be a lot of permeable areas and the density of development is and will be low, although slightly higher than in the Wesola district. The biggest threat is posed by heavy rains that may cause local flooding. It is foreseen that short, heavy rainfall events may be more frequent than in other parts of the city. Rembertów is situated on the border of the Warsaw's urban heat island. What is particularly tiring for the residents is the occurrence of hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. In spite of the threat of heavy rainfall, the district experiences dry periods, at least two weeks without rain, twice as frequently as other parts of the city. In summer this may lead to plant wilting as well as to breakouts and spreading of dangerous forest fires.

## Wawer

In the Wawer district, the situation is similar to that in the districts of Wesola and Rembertów, that is, green spaces and forests play an important role and the development of housing units (by 2030) is foreseen at a moderate level. At present as in future, there are and there will be a lot of permeable areas, the density of development is low and it may become moderate in future. The source of the biggest threat are heavy rains that may cause local flooding. Long periods without rain are typical for the Wawer area, whereas the rainfalls, when they occur, are intense. In addition, part of the district, including the built-up areas, is at risk of flooding from the Vistula River. The district is situated outside the Warsaw's urban heat island. However, the fact that it is surrounded by coniferous forests, often growing on sandy soil, may be conducive to local, significant rise in temperature. At the same time, the occurrence of at least two-week periods without rain that is twice as frequent in this district as in other parts of the city, may lead to plant wilting and breakouts and spreading of dangerous forest fires.
7

# Białołęka

The situation in the Białołęka district, where at present the threats are low, may change in future (by 2030), because of the forecasted intensive development of housing units, which may lead to significant increase of climate threat. First of all, as a result of the higher development density and the growth of impermeable area, the risk of local flooding will be greater. Currently, the biggest threat for Białołęka is flood on the Vistula River which may inundate a significant part of housing estates in Tarchomin and

Nowodwory as well as those located further away from the river, towards Annopol and Brzeziny. Because of heavy rainfall, local watercourses such as the Długa River may also be a threat. The Białołęka district, currently classified within the group with moderate threat, may in future be shifted to the group of significant threat.

## II. GROUP WITH SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE THREAT (112.8 KM2, I.E. 21.8% OF THE CITY AREA).

This Group includes the following districts: Ursynów, Wilanów and Bielany.

### Ursynów

This is a district with a smaller area covered by green spaces and forests (compared to Group I) and with forecasted significant increase in the number of housing units by 2030, which in future may lead to higher climate threat. First of all, as a result of increased density of development and greater impermeable area the risk of local flooding will grow. In the northern part of Ursynów, the urban heat island effect exists. Some surfaces covered with concrete may heat up to more than 40° C. What is particularly tiring for the residents is the occurrence of hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. The large area of the Kabaty Woods has some heat mitigating impact. In the southern part of Ursynów there is a high threat of heavy rains which often result in local flooding.

### Wilanów

This is a district which, similarly to Ursynów, has fewer green spaces and forests (compared to Group I) and where significant increase in the number of housing units is forecasted by 2030. In future this may lead to higher climate threat, such as locally higher temperatures (local heat island) or to local flooding due to increased development density and larger impermeable area. In case of a catastrophic flood on the Vistula River, a substantial part of Wilanów may be flooded with a water column 2-3 m high. The district is also exposed to heavy rainfall. The risk is aggravated by the rising water of local watercourses, e.g. Potok Służewiecki, following heavy rains. Wilanów is situated outside the Warsaw's urban heat island.

### Bielany

Green spaces and forests play a great role in the Bielany district, but in spite of that, the district lies on the border of the Warsaw urban heat island. What is particularly tiring for the residents is the
occurrence of hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. In future, the situation may change for the worse because of the significant increase in the number of housing units forecasted by 2030, which will increase the climate threat. First of all, as a result of the growth in development density and larger impermeable area, the risk of local flooding will grow. Green spaces constitute an important element in

the district's water management. They help to significantly delay the drainage of water after a heavy rain and by "retaining" water during hot periods, they substantially reduce the level of heat felt. The parts of Bielany district bordering the Vistula River are at risk of inundation during a flood event. These include mainly the Bielański Forest and the Młociński Forest.

8

## III. GROUP WITH STRONG CLIMATE THREAT (87.2 KM2, I.E. 16.8% OF THE CITY AREA).

This group includes the following districts: Targówek, Bemowo, Włochy and Ursus.

### Targówek

In this group, Targówek is the district with the lowest climate threat, where an important role is played by green spaces and forests, but this may change as a result of the significant development of housing units by 2030. First of all, as a result of the growth in development density and larger impermeable area, the risk of local flooding will increase. The most troublesome effect for the residents of Targówek, and especially Zacisze, may be local flooding following a heavy rainfall. Heavy rains also pose a risk of flood from local canals, especially the Bródnowski Canal. The district is situated within the limits of the Warsaw urban heat island and, as a consequence of the housing development, the heat island effect may intensify. Particularly tiring for the residents are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover.

### Bemowo

The situation in Bemowo is similar to Targówek, although the role of green spaces and forests is less significant. For the residents of Bemowo the most troublesome weather events are heatwaves. The district is situated on the border of the Warsaw heat island, which may extend and intensify as a result of the significant increase in the number of housing units forecasted by the year 2030. The areas covered tightly with concrete may heat up even to 40°C. Particularly tiring for the residents are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. Thick greenery in housing estates as well as the numerous parks and squares help reduce the nuisance caused by these phenomena. i.

### Włochy

This is a district with a small share of green spaces and forests. An increase in the number of housing units is forecasted by 2030. Heatwaves are the weather event most troublesome for the residents. The district is situated on the border of the Warsaw's urban heat island. With the high sun exposure, the vast areas covered with warehouses and storage spaces heat up even above 40°C.
Particularly tiring for the residents are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. Heavy rains cause serious problems leading to a threat of local flooding. Most of the rainwater drainage systems are based on absorbing wells which are not able to absorb huge amounts of water in a short time during an above-average rainfall event.

## Ursus

The Ursus district, similarly to the Włochy district, has a low percentage of green spaces and forests and by 2030 an increase in the number of housing units is forecasted. This may contribute to extension and intensification of the Warsaw's urban heat island effect, which is already present within the limits of the district. Some spaces in the post-industrial areas heat up to more than 40°C during hot weather. Particularly tiring for the residents are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. In Ursus there is a high threat of heavy rains which may cause local flooding.

## IV. GROUP WITH HIGH CLIMATE THREAT (53.6 KM2, I.E. 10.4% OF THE CITY AREA).

This group includes the following districts: Mokotów, Żoliborz and Ochota.

### Mokotów

The Mokotów district's exposure to negative impacts of climate change and extreme weather events varies. The Upper Mokotów lies within the limits of the Warsaw's urban heat island and therefore heatwaves may be the most troublesome for the residents there. Particularly tiring are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. In future, Mokotów may be in a difficult situation because of the little role played by green spaces and forests and the forecasted significant increase in the number of housing units by 2030. First of all, as a result of the growing density of development and larger impermeable area, the risk of local flooding will grow. Floods pose the greatest threat to Lower Mokotów. In case of a catastrophic flood on the Vistula River, almost the entire area may be flooded with a water column 2-3 m high. The threat is aggravated by the rising water of local watercourses, e.g. Potok Służewiecki, following heavy rains.

### Żoliborz

For the residents of the Żoliborz district the most troublesome may be the heatwave events. The district is situated on the border of the Warsaw urban heat island. Particularly tiring are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. Thick greenery at the housing estates as well as numerous parks and squares help to reduce the nuisance caused by these phenomena. Żoliborz is a district with high percentage of impermeable areas. In future, Żoliborz, similarly to Mokotów, may find itself in a difficult situation because of the significant increase in the number of housing units by 2030. It is the area with the heaviest short-term rainfalls which lead to local flooding.

9
0

# Ochota

Ochota is situated in the centre of the Warsaw urban heat island, therefore heatwaves may be the most troublesome phenomenon for the residents. During the hottest days the temperature in Ochota may be 6 degrees higher than outside the city. Particularly tiring are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. Ochota is a district with high percentage of impermeable areas, which cover more than 70% of the district's surface. Such a situation aggravates the heat and contributes to excessive accumulation of rainwater in undesirable places on the surface, leading to local flooding. In future the situation may deteriorate because of the little role played by green spaces and forests and the forecasted significant growth in the number of housing units by 2030.

# V. GROUP WITH THE HIGHEST CLIMATE THREAT (68.7 KM2, I.E. 13.3% OF THE CITY AREA).

This group includes the following districts: Praga-Południe, Praga-Północ, Wola and Śródmieście.

## Praga-Południe

The Praga-Południe district, and especially Saska Kępa and Gocław, is the area with high threat of floods. In case of a catastrophic flood, the area may be inundated by a water column 3 m high, and the cubature of the flooded buildings may exceed 1 million m³. In the part of Warsaw on the right bank of the Vistula River, the centre of the urban island effect is located near Rondo Wiatraczna. Particularly tiring are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. The small percentage of green spaces and forests makes the situation even worse. An increase in the number of housing units is forecasted in the area by 2030.

## Praga-Północ

The Praga-Północ district, and especially its centre and the area surrounding the ZOO, is the area with higher threat of flood. In case of a flood event, the area may be hit by a water column from 0.5 to 2 m high, and locally reaching even 4 m. Praga-Północ is situated within the limits of the Warsaw urban heat island. During the hottest days, the temperature in Praga-Północ may be 4-5 degrees higher than outside the city. The post-industrial and residential areas heavily covered with concrete (61% of the district's area) may heat up to more than 40°C. Particularly tiring are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. The small percentage of green spaces and forests makes the situation even worse. An increase in the number of housing units is forecasted in the area by 2030.

## Wola

In the Wola district the climate threat is very high, with the role of green spaces and forests assessed as moderate and a significant increase in the number of housing units is forecasted by 2030. In future this may lead to increased climate threat exceeding the current levels. First of all, as a result of the higher development density and the growth of impermeable area the risk of local flooding will increase. Wola is situated at the centre of the Warsaw urban heat island and therefore heatwaves may be the most troublesome
me weather events for the residents. During the hottest days the temperature in Wola may be 5-6 degrees higher than outside the city. Particularly tiring are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. Wola is a district with high percentage of impermeable areas, which cover almost 70% of the district's surface. This aggravates the heat and contributes to excessive accumulation of rainwater in undesirable places on the surface, leading to local flooding.

## Śródmieście

Śródmieście district is the area with the highest climate threat in Warsaw. This is caused by little number of green spaces and forests. However, by 2030 no significant increase in the number of housing units is forecasted. Śródmieście is situated at the centre of the Warsaw urban heat island therefore heatwaves may be the most troublesome phenomenon for the residents. During the hottest days, the temperature in Śródmieście may be 6 degrees higher than outside the city. Particularly tiring are hot nights with temperature above 20°C, which do not allow people to rest and recover. Śródmieście is an area with high share of impermeable surfaces – almost 70% of the district's area. The quick drainage of water from such areas during rain often leads to local flooding that may affect especially the Powiśle area, which is also vulnerable to flood risk.

ADAPTATION OF WARSAW TO CLIMATE CHANGE

PRIORITY AND RULES

In spite of the efforts of the international community, climate change is progressing. For Warsaw and its residents it means the growing threat of a greater number and intensity of extreme weather events,

primarily heatwaves, drought, strong winds, flood events and local flooding. Considering this, the members of the Warsaw Round Table for Adaptation to Climate Change (WOSAK)²⁶ proposed that the city of Warsaw and its residents should be guided by the following motto:

**WARSAW – A COMMUNITY ACTING RESPONSIBLY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE.**

The following PRIORITY has been adopted:

**TO PREPARE WARSAW TO THE IMMINENT CLIMATE CHANGE, MAINLY BY MITIGATING ITS IMPACTS AND ENSURING SMOOTH FUNCTIONING OF THE CITY WITH ACCEPTABLE COSTS FOR ECONOMY, SOCIETY AND NATURE.**

The rules by which the authorities, the residents and the entrepreneurs of Warsaw should be guided are the following:

) The authorities of Warsaw, when preparing planning documents, especially those pertaining to spatial development and adoption of the city budget, shall take into consideration the need for action aimed at adaptation to climate change and its consequences;

²⁶ Warszawski Okrągły Stół ds. Adaptacji do Zmiany Klimatu, known as WOSAK [Warsaw Round Table for Climate Change Adaptation] was convened by Mayor of Warsaw and comprised representatives of non-governmental organisations, academia, Warsaw City Hall and the entities providing services for the residents of the city. The aim of WOSAK was to enable cooperation between the local government, academia, non-governmental and business communities on preparing the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the City of Warsaw. It was an advisory body that prepared recommendations on the directions and the manner of implementing the Strategy.

7
8

When undertaking investment or procurement activities (wherever it is justified) the need for climate change adaptation action shall be considered and the standards and norms resulting from future climate conditions shall be applied;

The Warsaw administration shall introduce model solutions aimed at adaptation to climate change and its consequences;

The needs of the emergency services shall be the priority in Warsaw, both in developing spatial development solutions and in the management of individual facilities;

Individual areas of Warsaw (according to their local specificity) and social groups (according to their vulnerability) shall be given equal treatment from the point of view of adaptation action;

Information about climate change, its consequences and the meteorological data shall be collected in a uniform manner and shall be fully available for the services and entities managing the climate risk; the information and the data shall be also relayed to the population and the business community of Warsaw in a clear manner – the threats shall not be concealed;

In Warsaw, the authorities, the local communities and the business community shall regularly conduct educational activities to inform about climate change threats and their consequences according to the following principle: see, touch, understand, act; every important activity in the city aiming to protect the climate or adapt to climate change shall be used as an opportunity to educate and inform the residents in order to raise their climate awareness;

Conditions shall be created for local activism and strengthening the self-organisation and self-sufficiency (using the social capital) in the face of the appearing threats;

The areas of Warsaw and the places exposed to high climate change risk must be covered by contingency plans developed with the participation of the public;

Because of the specific nature of climate change and its consequences, Warsaw shall be guided by the following rules when dealing with vital detailed issues:

During the hot season, measures shall be applied to reduce the heat entering building structures whereas in the cold season the escape of heat from building shall be prevented;

Rainwater shall be properly managed, in particular, it should be managed where generated;

Green and blue infrastructure shall be preserved, strengthened and developed as much as possible with reference to the concept of ecosystem services.
The following should be done in order to reduce the threats to Warsaw while following the above mentioned rules:

To ensure the possibility of safe management or collection of water in Warsaw;
To ensure operation of the technical infrastructure and supplies in Warsaw in case of extreme weather events;
To ensure that human health and lives are protected in case of extreme weather events – mainly heatwaves, floods and heavy rains and sanitary and epidemiological threats related to them;
To support responsible local activities preventing and removing the impacts of extreme weather events, particularly strong wind.

## 4.2. LINES OF ACTION

I. TO ENSURE CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF MEASURES THAT WILL GUARANTEE WARSAW'S ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

In order to maximise the resilience of the city to climate change it is necessary to ensure that activities undertaken by Warsaw, in all areas, take into account the climate change aspect. For a successful outcome it is particularly important to develop the city space in a manner that takes account of the need to adapt to these changes. Therefore, when preparing development programming documents, both at the strategic and the executive level, the threats that the city will have to face must be considered. With appropriate action, the consequences will certainly be mitigated and the smooth functioning of the city will be ensured. For Warsaw, it is especially important is to draw attention to the development of areas at risk of flood as well as construction of systems to control the water flow. This problem should be viewed from the point of view of the infrastructure, bearing in mind the social aspect.

In particular, the following actions should be undertaken:

To monitor climate change and collect data about threats,
To optimise the system for coordination of the adaptation process,
To make the adaptation process more coherent, in particular, by ensuring that provisions included in the Warsaw development programming documents, planning and financial documents are consistent,
To ensure that the Warsaw development programming, planning and financial documents take account of the climate change adaptation requirements relevant to the appearing threats.
1

# II. TO ENSURE COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AT THE LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL.

Extreme weather events occurring as a result of climate change do not need to originate inside Warsaw in order to have negative impact on the city. What is more, they are not limited to the city administrative boundaries but often cover wider areas. That is why Warsaw must seek to establish cooperation at both the local as well as regional and national levels. It is necessary to develop mechanisms for communication and access to information as well as to create common programmes and undertake joint action. To ensure security it is necessary to optimise the system whereby the city administration and the residents work together with emergency and law enforcement services.

It is important to build cooperation with the residents of Warsaw and with the neighbouring local communities, including local authorities, and to foster common education and experience/ good practices sharing with regard to spatial interdependence of climate change-related extreme weather events.

In order to eliminate or reduce the negative impact of extreme weather events it is necessary to ensure proper functioning of the links between the green and the blue infrastructure on the area much larger than just the area of Warsaw. This is one of the reasons why Warsaw, apart from the above mentioned cooperation, should engage in joint activities with administrative institutions, non-governmental organisations or entrepreneurs, both at the local (metropolitan) and national level and at the international level.

In particular, the following should be done:

To form and optimise a system of joint cooperation,
To develop channels for efficient communication between the stakeholders for the purpose of collecting data and exchanging information about the occurrence of adverse weather events and their consequences, within the framework of various data collection systems: local, regional and national,
To create a platform for exchange of information, experience, good practices concerning adaptation activities and their effectiveness,
To implement systemic solutions that enable participation of the entities responsible for green areas maintenance in the design and construction works related to infrastructure projects,
To develop and implement common procedures, warning and information systems in case of the occurrence of extreme weather events and their consequences,
To conduct joint workshops, exercises and training courses for local government administration, the institutions monitoring the environment and the services, guards and inspectorates as part of crisis management.

# III. TO RAISE AWARENESS OF HOW TO BEHAVE IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE

In order to improve the security of the residents and ensure proper quality of life it is particularly important to develop the society that is well informed and responsible for the decisions and choices it makes. It is necessary to foster attitudes of caring for one another, e.g. by building civic and social competencies, both among residents and administration officials. One of the tools to achieve the desired results is to educate the society and the Warsaw city administration, as well as the entities in charge of spatial planning, provision of utilities and security, about the nature and scale of the threats related to extreme weather events and to create a system of information about extreme weather events and the appropriate conduct when they occur.

In particular, the following should be done:

To keep raising the awareness and understanding of climate change among the residents in order to improve their ability to respond to the risk,
To educate the public about the impacts of climate change, adaptation actions and response when the threat occurs,
To ensure regular access to information about the possible threats and the way to respond to them,
To promote and inform the stakeholders about the climate change adaptation activities,
To provide specialist education focused on improving awareness, skills and knowledge, especially among administration officials, decision makers, municipal services, planning specialists, urban planners, architects,
To raise awareness of local governments within the Warsaw Metropolitan Area about spatial interdependence of climate change-related extreme weather events,
To develop pilot preventive projects as elements of education and good practices building,
To introduce a system of prohibitions, recommendations and restrictions related to risks (such as a ban on entry into forests because of fire risk, restrictions in the use of water at the time of water deficit, prohibition on entry into parks or cemeteries in case of strong winds), as an element of education on threats and risks.
IV. TO IMPROVE WARSAW'S RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

In order to ensure that Warsaw's resilience reaches the adequate level, it is necessary, in particular, to attach the same importance to the green and the blue infrastructure as to the technical infrastructure and the built-up areas. The green and blue infrastructure is, on the one hand, a tool for mitigating and adaptation to climate change, on the other hand, it is threatened by this phenomenon and requires protection from extreme weather events. The current change in the approach to this infrastructure makes it also necessary to draw attention to the need to ensure the provision of ecosystem services in the context of climate change and extreme weather events. This applies in particular to such services as the conditions for the provision of high quality food, provision of drinking water, climate regulation and protection from natural threats, soil erosion control or recreational spaces.

In particular, the following should be done:

To strengthen the role of the green and blue infrastructure,
To adapt the water management system, in particular, to improve biodiversity and retention capability of green spaces while increasing their overall area, to restore the retention capability of impermeable surfaces, to create infrastructure capable of retaining water on site,
To improve the resilience of technical infrastructure to extreme weather events and to ensure its efficient operation and the provision of utilities to the city when such extreme weather events occur,
To take action to reduce the severity of extreme weather events and their impact on the health and life of the residents,
To adapt the social infrastructure so as to ensure security to all those who need it in case of extreme weather events.

## 4.3. ADVANTAGES OF TAKING ACTION TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE

The implementation of the guidelines set out in this document will enable the management of climate risk in Warsaw by 2030 and after that date. The adaptability of the entire city as well as that of the individual districts, households, businesses and institutions will improve as will the adaptation capability of the residents and civil society organisations.

It will contribute to a significant improvement of the quality of life in the city and will help protect the residents' health. The process of Warsaw's adaptation to climate change will undoubtedly make the city more competitive, it will help to develop the labour market, to create attractive and safe spaces, will improve the quality of the environment and introduce more effective mechanisms for its protection. It will also result in creating demand for modern technology and innovative solutions in Warsaw.

A lot of the solutions adapting the city to climate change will be multi-functional in character and will be developed together with the residents of Warsaw in the process of co-designing and co-creating, thus enabling the use of the social capital built in the process.

It will also impact on the rise of awareness, knowledge gathering and information exchange as well as the ability to implement adaptation measures improving the resilience of the city and its infrastructure. In particular, it will contribute to ensuring the security of the residents and to avoiding losses or increasing the ability to quickly restore functioning of the city, its residents and businesses, in case of negative impacts of climate change.

### EXPECTED DIRECT BENEFITS

Increased biodiversity, leading to ecological added value for the city and strengthening of the ecosystems providing ecosystem services to the city and its residents.
Improved security and better health protection as well as comfort and quality of life for residents.
Increased public awareness and engagement of residents.
Reducing financial and material losses.
Improving the city's competitiveness and creating new jobs.
# 5. GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTING DOCUMENTS

## 5.1. LINKS TO THE WARSAW DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING DOCUMENTS

The document plays the role of a policy paper for the Strategy #Warszawa2030 and sets out the principles and guidelines for the urban programmes for climate change adaptation.

The issues presented in the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the city of Warsaw by 2030 with the prospects until 2050, because of their specific nature, are linked with a number of areas, both social and economic, as well as the area of nature. It covers

a range activities, from "soft" ones (educational, informational, organisational) to "hard" ones (investment, technology), touching upon practically all areas of the city's functioning. For Warsaw to adapt to climate change, it is necessary to ensure that the documents programming the city's development are consistent and to make sure that projects are implemented in accordance with the established adaptation action lines. It is important to ensure that the preparation of the programmes for achieving the operational objectives of the Strategy #Warszawa2030 is realised taking account of the principles and guidelines set forth in this document as well as in cooperation between the individual areas.

# 5.2. LINKS TO THE PLANNING DOCUMENTS

As the analyses conducted as part of the ADAPTCITY project show, the main climate change-related threats for Warsaw are thermal threats (the urban heat island effect) and hydrological threats (local flooding following heavy rainfall and floods). At the same time, the work adapting the city to climate change should be linked with the measures to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.

In order to achieve the appropriate effects it is necessary to ensure the proper correlation between the strategic and the planning documents. The shaping of the spatial planning policy in a manner that protects the city from the negative impacts of climate change is a necessary condition for the success of the entire enterprise. That is why spatial planning is a very important tool in mitigating the impacts of climate change and implementing adaptation mechanisms; it also guarantees that the right microclimate is created in the city.

The inclusion in the spatial planning of the guidelines for the adaptation of the city to climate change will make it possible to reduce the consequences of climate threats. Such use of spatial planning is based primarily on applying the basic instruments of spatial planning, such as determination of the land use or ensuring coherent use of various environmental forms in a given area, which will enable informed management of spatial resources. Thanks to spatial planning it is possible to specify the function of a given area and thus prevent it from being managed in an inappropriate way, and limit the range and influence the shape of the heat island. Sustainable development, protection of open and green spaces and local management of rainwater are particularly important. It is necessary for planning documents to take account of the results of the monitoring of urban heat island effect and the results of the analyses that provide information about the potential threat of flooding and the risk of flood from the Vistula River.

# 5.3. STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION

The process of the adaptation of Warsaw to climate change, consistent with the direction set out in the Adaptation Strategy is supervised by the Mayor of Warsaw supported in this task by the Climate Protection Team$^{27}$. The coordination of the adaptation process is the responsibility of the bureau nominated by the Mayor of Warsaw to perform, among others, the following tasks:

To cooperate in creating programmes and annual plans for the areas related to climate change adaptation,
To monitor climate change and to assess its impact on the city, including a diagnosis of the city ecosystem's resilience to climate change,
To evaluate the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the city of Warsaw,
To perform the reporting tasks in connection with the adaptation process,
To update, on the basis of the analysis and assessment of the progressing climate change, the lines of action necessary to minimise the costs resulting from the damage caused by extreme weather events and the need to ensure security and comfort of life to the residents,
To study the adaptation awareness and needs among the city's residents and selected city administration units.

The Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the city of Warsaw is a horizontal document, which means that it requires coherent action on the part of all entities responsible for individual areas of the functioning of the city. The Adaptation Strategy will be implemented via implementing documents. The principles and the lines of action included in this document shall constitute the guidelines that should be taken into account during the development of all the implementation documents in Warsaw, including the programmes that describe in detail the implementation of the operational objectives of the Strategy #Warszawa2030 or other mandatory tasks of the city. Thus the entities preparing and implementing the programmes are the direct implementers of the provisions of the Adaptation Strategy.

The programmes of the operational objectives of the Strategy #Warszawa2030, which should, in particular, include the guidelines of the Adaptation Strategy have been presented in Table 3 below.

$^{27}$ Regulation No. 1823/2008 of the Mayor of Warsaw dated 7 July 2008 on appointing the Climate Protection Team, as amended.

# 5.4. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

## Monitoring

In order to optimise the process of Warsaw's adaptation to climate change, ongoing monitoring of climate change and assessment of its impact on the city will be conducted, including a diagnosis of the resilience of the city's ecosystem to climate change.

In addition, the indicators adopted in individual programmes will be used to monitor the implementation of the Adaptation Strategy provisions.

Reports concerning the level of implementation of measures adapting the city to climate change will be prepared in a three-year cycle by the bureau responsible for the coordination of the adaptation process in the city.

## Evaluation

In order to assess the relevance, effectiveness, sustainability, efficiency and usefulness of the actions adapting Warsaw to climate change, evaluation studies will be carried out.

Ongoing evaluation will be conducted to assess whether the actions undertaken so far have been implemented in accordance with the adopted Adaptation Strategy guidelines, whether they bring the expected effects, and whether they are adequate to the threats resulting from the constantly changing climate.

In particular, the results of the monitoring of the implementation of adaptation activities contained in individual programmes, as well as the monitoring of climate change and the assessment of its impact on the city will be used for evaluation purposes.

The results of the on-going evaluation will make it possible to introduce appropriate adjustments to the programmes and the guidelines included in the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the city of Warsaw. In addition, on the basis of the evaluations, a decision may be taken concerning the need to update this document.

It is also planned to carry out a final ex-post evaluation in order to make a comprehensive assessment of the effects of including the Adaptation Strategy guidelines in the implementing documents.

The evaluation studies will be conducted by the bureau responsible for the coordination of the adaptation process in the city.

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Climate change adaptation – according to the United Nations, it is the adaptation to changes in the ecological, social and economic systems in response to the actual or expected climate changes and their effects or impact. This applies also to modification of processes, practices and structures that lead to reducing possible losses and to using the opportunities related to climate change.

Albedo – the ratio of the radiation reflected to the radiation received; it describes the ability of a given surface to reflect radiation.

Very hot days – days with temperature above 30°C.

Supply of utilities and food to the city – supply of utilities such as electricity, heat, gas, water or disposal of wastewater and solid waste, ensuring proper functioning of the city as well as the provision of the appropriate quantity and quality of food products.

Extreme weather events – violent and intense precipitation, strong winds, heat waves, thunderstorms, storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, etc.

Heatwaves – continuous sequence of at least 3 days when the average maximum temperature reaches at least 30°C; that is, during such period there are both very hot days (with maximum temperature above 30°C), and hot days (with maximum temperature above 25°C), with two conditions that must be met: 1) the number of very hot days should exceed or at least equal the number of hot days, 2) the sequence of hot days between the very hot days may not exceed three.

Global climate warming – a phenomenon related to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane or nitrous oxide. Global warming is the increase in the natural greenhouse effect. The essence of the effect

is that greenhouse gases found in the atmosphere let through the sun radiation, which heats the Earth, but retain the long-wave thermal radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. The captured thermal radiation heats the Earth's atmosphere, and the rest of it flows into space. The increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere means that a greater proportion of the long-wave radiation is directed back to the planet's surface. Greenhouse gases form a heat trap that works just like a greenhouse. Without greenhouse gases, the Earth's average temperature would be about 33°C lower, i.e. -18°C, while it is currently +15°C.²⁸

Technical infrastructure – pursuant to the Act dated 21 August 1997 on real property management (Journal of Laws of 2018, item 2204), technical infrastructure facilities shall mean roads and water supply, sewage, heat distribution, electric, gas and telecommunications pipework, cables, facilities and fittings, built under ground, over ground or above the ground.

Green and blue infrastructure – a network of nature-related links which has a positive effect both on the conditions of life in a city and on the city's nature environment. It includes green spaces, e.g. parks, squares, landscaped greens, street greenery, green roofs and walls as well as water resources such as rivers, streams, ditches, lakes and water reservoirs, marshes and various solutions for rainwater management.

Housing unit (number) – number of flats in a selected period in selected areas

Urban heat island effect – a phenomenon that occurs in urban areas, where temperature in the city is higher than in the surrounding area. It concerns, in particular, centres of densely built-up

²⁸ A. Arcipowska, A. Kassenberg, Małe ABC... ochrony klimatu, Institute for Sustainable Development, Warsaw 2007.
cities, without green areas and water courses or water reservoirs. High daily and annual variability is characteristic of urban heat island effect, it also occurs more frequently in summer than in winter. The biggest differences in temperature occur during clear, cloudless nights, when the heat captured in the city during the day is released.

**Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)** – a team of climate scientists conducting assessment studies on the basis of which governments and international organisations may initiate action and set policy frameworks to counter climate change. IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, to assess the risk related to human impact on the climate. Since 1989, IPCC has been regularly preparing reports on the present and forecasted changes of the climate. The Fifth Assessment Report, AR5, was published on 2 November 2014. The Special Report on Global Warming of $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ was released on 8 October 2018.

**Tropical nights** – nights during which air temperature does not fall below 20°C.

**Resilience of the city to climate change** – ability of the city to prepare for the threats related to extreme weather events while maintaining proper functioning of the city.

**The Covenant of Mayors** – the biggest initiative of city authorities in the world concerning energy and climate, grouping representatives of almost 8 thousand local and regional authorities which voluntarily implement the European climate and energy objectives in their areas and implement the integrated programme for mitigating climate changes and adapting the cities to their impacts$^{29}$. Warsaw has been a member of the Covenant since 2009.

**Biologically active surface** – native soil covered with plants together with surface water on a building plot, as well as 50% of the total surface of terraces and flat roofs, landscaped as permanent lawns or flower beds on a soil ensuring the natural vegetation, with an area not smaller than 10 m².

**Impermeable surface** – surface that is not capable of filtering water.

**Climate risk** – the risk, the scale of the effects and the probability of their occurrence, resulting from the intensity, scale and speed of climate change and extreme weather events related to it, which may have negative impact on people, built-up areas, including technical infrastructure and the natural environment, including the green and blue infrastructure.

**Ecosystems services** – benefits that the natural environment brings to humans and the economy, such as conditions for good quality food production, supply of drinking water and wood, climate regulation and protection from natural threats, soil erosion control and space for leisure activities.

**Climate threat** – includes thermal, hydrological threats as well as a threat of drought and strong winds. The degree of thermal threat to the city results from the assessment including average total solar radiation, albedo of the active surface, land cover and average temperature of the active surface whereas the degree of hydrological threat results from the assessment of the scale of local flooding after heavy rains and submersion as a result of flood. The degree of drought threat is a resultant of the thermal threat and is expressed by the length of the period (days) without precipitation and with high temperature. The degree of threat of strong wind is a combined result of its strength and duration.
