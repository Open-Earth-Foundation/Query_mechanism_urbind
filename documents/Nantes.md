# Edito

Will our planet, our cities and our towns still be habitable in 30 years from now?

Will our way of life, our relationship with nature, the state of the environment, will we be able to live happily in the years to come?

These are the dizzying questions we face. And that's why the climate emergency is one of the top priorities of the city's action.

As a pioneer in the fight against climate change, Nantes Métropole adopted its first Climate Plan in 2007, launched a major debate on energy transition in 2016 on energy transition, and drew up its first Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan in 2018. Today, the new 2024-2030 PCAET goes even further. The aim is not only to strengthen our collective efforts to achieve our carbon neutrality targets, but also to speed up the implementation of measures to adapt to climate change, i.e. to anticipate its impacts and protect the population.

Let's face it, our local actions are having an impact: between 2004 and 2024, we reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 35% per capita. Thanks to the actions implemented at the start of this mandate, we are in the process of reversing the trajectory of our emissions.

Nevertheless, at the rate we've been going over the last 20 years, we won't achieve carbon neutrality until 2320! So we need to raise our ambitions and we all need to work together to achieve it. This major change of direction is necessary, and everyone must be convinced of this, especially as the disruptions are becoming more and closer to home every year, with heatwaves, droughts and floods.

This new Climate Plan and the Climate City Contract have one essential characteristic to us: they are the result of a collective dynamic. First and foremost, it was co-constructed with the Metropole's partners, the metropolitan municipalities and citizens through the "Fabrique de nos villes" major metropolitan debate. And many of their actions are devoted to informing, mobilising and supporting everyone.

It is essential to fight for the ecology and for social progress at the same time, because we know that the consequences of global warming affect the most vulnerable more strongly and more quickly than the rest of the population.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Awareness of the urgency of climate change, and the desire to take concrete action, are now widespread in our society. That's what's at stake in this climate plan, which we want to be "popular": to awaken, federate, recognise and support the will to act that exists in our society, this mobilisation of citizens that can undoubtedly change things just as much as the millions of euros we are investing in infrastructure.

Because global warming will be an enormous accelerator of social inequalities, moving towards a greener world necessarily involves a challenge of solidarity and equality.

As the author Salomé Saqué writes, a person born in 2020 will experience seven times more heatwaves in their lifetime than someone born in 1960! We are facing a major generational and collective challenge that we want to help meet.

# 1. Introduction

## Demographics

Nantes Métropole is a French metropolis in the loire-Atlantique département and Pays de la loire region. It was home to 672,420 inhabitants in 2020. Nantes Métropole is one of France's most dynamic metropolitan areas. Indeed, Nantes Métropole's territory has experienced strong demographic growth in recent years. The population grew by 21% between 1999 and 2020, with year acceleration in the last decade. Between 2014 and 2020, more than 8,500 people will have moved into the area each year. Welcoming this new population requires appropriate planning in terms of housing, social, cultural and educational facilities, as well as infrastructure and economic activity. This planning is a major challenge for maintaining quality of life and preserving the region's environmental conditions, in short, it is crucial if the Metropolis is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. All the more so as, among the INSEE scenarios, the one chosen anticipates year increase in the Nantes metropolitan area's population of 75,000 compared to the population in 2013, i.e. 680,000 inhabitants by 2030.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 1 - Towards a slowdown in population growth (INSEE study - October 2023)

## Economy

This demographic dynamism is also accompanied by economic dynamism. Indeed, Nantes Métropole's economic activity has historically been structured around the loire River, which has supported the development of trade, transport and industry. There is a strong tertiary concentration of jobs in the area, with one job in two located in the city center, although there is a tendency for jobs to spread out. Of course, the city of Nantes has retained its role as year economic engine, but employment has grown strongly in the other communes of Nantes Métropole and beyond in the urban area.

# Air

Air quality in the metropolitan area was average, despite a reduction in atmospheric pollutants between 2003 and 2021p. In 2022, air quality was average on 71% of the days of the year and good on only 8 days. It was even considered "degraded to very poor" 29% of the year (in summer mainly because of ozone formation and in winter because of particulate emissions).

Between 2003 and 2021 forecast, Basemis data highlight the following conclusions:

The road transport sector remains the main cause of air quality deterioration in metropolitan France.
The residential sector accounts for the majority of pollutant emissions, particularly particulate matter.

# Climate Change

Nantes Métropole is vulnerable to climate change because of the rise in average temperatures and the numerous heat waves that affect the area. Temperatures have risen by an average of around 1.5°C over the last sixty years. The Pays de la Loire region recorded as many heat waves between 2000 and 2020 as in the previous five decades. These periods will be more frequent, earlier in the year, longer and more severe.

During the summer of 2022, Nantes Métropole experienced unprecedented heat waves, with local temperatures reaching 42°C. Accidental fires were exacerbated by the combined effects of heat and drought. Over such a period, residents are more exposed to a deterioration in their health, particularly for the most sensitive, while the average level of comfort is considerably reduced. Public spaces, particularly in the densely populated urban centres of our metropolis, can become too inhospitable in hot conditions to allow people to recharge their batteries and enjoy a high level of comfort. The phenomenon is exacerbated in urban areas where ventilation of spaces can be reduced due to the density of buildings, and where the high mineral content and lack of vegetation encourage both the absorption and then storage of heat (causing overheating at night) and also the rise in temperature of surfaces (floors, facades and furniture).

# Greenhouse gas emissions

Nantes Métropole has been involved in the fight against climate change for many years. The actions and policies put in place by Nantes Métropole and local stakeholders have produced significant results:

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract
Page 8
Nantes Métropole
Climate City Contract
NET ZERO CITIES

24% reduction in per capita energy consumption between 2003 and 2021. This represents an overall reduction of 3% despite a 27% increase in population at the same time.
32% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per capita over the same period. This represents an overall reduction of 13% despite a 27% increase in population at the same time.

However, continuing on this trajectory will not make it possible to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, let alone 2030.

Currently, the average Nantes resident emits 9.6 tCO2eq/year, whereas the objective of carbon neutrality would require us to emit 2 tCO2eq/year. This significant reduction shows that the effort must come not only from the actions of individual citizens, but also from the massive decarbonisation of our systems and the implementation of certain breakthroughs to achieve carbon neutrality. At a local level, academic partners, players in innovation, smart cities and responsible digital technology are now working together to achieve this objective.

## Action Plan

In terms of mitigating climate change, the action plan envisaged as part of the Climate City Contract and the new Nantes Métropole Climate Plan is based on 5 axes:

A popular Climate Plan to raise awareness, involve and motivate all the forces in the area and its institutions
Sobriety: reducing our needs in terms of energy, mobility, energy renovation and businesses
Resources: reducing imported emissions through food, digital technology and re-use, for example.
The energy mix: 20% local RE production by 2030, 100% RE consumption by 2050
Natural carbon sinks: preserve and develop them

In terms of adapting to climate change, the action plan envisaged under the Climate City Contract focuses on 3 areas:

Urban resilience, towards a natural and healthy metropolis
Agricultural resilience, to protect biodiversity and water resources
Resilience and crisis management

# 2. The City Climate Contract preparation process

Nantes Métropole has built up a strong mandate with all the stakeholders in order to move the process forward within a clear and precise framework. Internally, technical committees and steering committees with elected representatives have been strengthened (C.1-2 Description of organisational and governance measures). Externally, Nantes Métropole initially started with 25 partners in the Mission Ville programme and has now built up a "community" of over 150 players. These players were brought together at events and working groups (Bifurcation Workshops, see C-2 Social Innovation Interventions). Stakeholders played year active role in drawing up action sheets organized by sub-theme. This collaboration has fostered a sharing of knowledge that is crucial to the ecological transition.

List of stakeholders involved in drawing up the Climate City Contract

In this way, Nantes Métropole has initiated a co-creation process involving all its stakeholders and working with new players. This inclusive approach has enabled the decision-making process to be enriched by the diversity of perspectives and skills.

The bifurcation workshops organised with the stakeholders listed above took place in several stages in order to advance step by step in the process and come up with concrete proposals:

## A.1-6: Description and assessment of the green house gas inventory

Our inventory is described with the "PCAET" reporting format (Decree 2016-849 of June 28, 2016) and includes the following sectors:

Residential
Commercial
Industrial
Transport (road and non-road, also known as other transport)
Waste management
Agriculture
Energy sector (excluding electricity, heat and cooling production for GHG emissions, as these emissions are recorded at the consumption stage).

Non-energy and energy-related GHG emissions are reported for each of the above-mentioned sectors.

In addition, the LULUCF sector (land use, land-use change and forestry) and the sector that collects emissions not included in the SECTEN or PCAET reporting formats, i.e. the biotic sector (natural emissions from forests, grasslands and wetlands), international aviation and international shipping, are reported separately.

In addition, GHG emissions from biomass are excluded from the totals, but are included in our inventory for information purposes.

In summary, the inventory covers direct emissions (Scope 1), i.e. those occurring on site, and also includes indirect GHG emissions linked to the consumption of heat and electricity (Scope 2). This means that direct GHG emissions linked to electricity and heat production facilities are accounted for at the level of the user sectors (residential, tertiary, etc.).

Although Nantes Métropole's population increased by 27% between 2003 and 2021, GHG emissions decreased by 13% over the same period, which is the reference period for Nantes Métropole's PCAET.

Per capita GHG emissions have fallen even further over the same period (-32%).

Given the high proportion of energy-related GHG emissions (over 90%) in Nantes Métropole, variations in GHG emissions from one year to the next are strongly correlated with variations in energy consumption.

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract
Page 16
Nantes Métropole
Climate City Contract
NET ZERO CITIES

Climate rigor, technological improvements, building insulation, the trend towards less carbon-intensive energy consumption (particularly wood-energy and electricity), etc. explain this reduction in GHG emissions.

Furthermore, in 2021, Nantes Métropole's LULUCF sector absorbs 32 kteqCO2. This absorption is not enough to offset the 2,404 kteqCO2 emitted in 2021 by the various activities in the area (there is a 1% ratio between GHG emissions and carbon sinks).

However, despite the virtuous efforts we have been making for decades and the encouraging results we have achieved, it is clear that continuing on our current trajectory will not enable us to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, let alone 2030. Mission Ville must help us accelerate and achieve the ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2030.

Note that the evolution of GHG emissions (table A 2.4) takes into account a BAU "Business As Usual" scenario (i.e. GHG emissions in 2030 without Mission Ville). This makes it possible to determine the scale of emissions reductions needed to achieve climate neutrality, while taking into account population growth, GDP increases, etc.

A complete list of the various public policies influencing environmental issues and the implementation of portfolio actions, as well as a document explaining how the French states works as there can be some particularities, can be found in Annex 2 – French cities framework.

## A.2-1: Assessment of current policies and strategies for carbon neutrality and energy transition

Beyond this long technical list, the interest lies above all in analysing the strategies put in place and seeing whether they are sufficiently effective.

## Evaluation of global policies

Are energy and climate policies and strategies aligned with the objectives?
Existing policies and strategies aim to be carbon neutral by 2050, which is in line with the international commitments made in the 2015 Paris Agreement and with the recommendations of scientists (IPCC in particular).

What are the strengths and weaknesses of energy and climate policies and strategies?
Although the measures taken to reduce the impact of the sectors that emit the most greenhouse gases (transport, residential, industry, digital, agriculture, etc.) are to be welcomed, much more needs to be done, particularly by adopting a principle of sobriety, putting in place adequate funding and an ambitious employment and training policy that is consistent with the objectives of ecological planning. It will also be necessary to prioritise uses in the face of constraints on access to the resources needed for the transition (TheShiftProject – 2023).

The table below summarises the main strengths and weaknesses of the ecological planning planned in France for each GHG emissions sector.

|  Secteur | Strengths | Weaknesses  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Transport | Prioritisation of small, light electric vehicles (weight penalty and support for industries producing intermediate vehicles and bicycles) | Need for clearer consideration of manufacturing emissions from electric vehicles and rare metal requirements  |
|   |  Development and reinforced maintenance of "sobriety infrastructures" (cycle paths, railway lines and stations, bus routes, etc.) | Invest in long-distance rail travel  |
|   |  Consideration of sober air travel | Control demand for air transport through regulatory measures (higher air fares, higher taxes, ban on certain domestic routes, etc.).  |
|  Energy renovation | Priority given to low-energy homes | Lack of employment figures and support for the new build sector  |
|   |  An end to new gas and oil-fired boilers | Caution about conflicts of use of biomass and biogas  |

|  Industry |   | Need for sectoral plans (steel, cement, chemicals and the different categories of industries and players), so that we can close the loop and come up with a genuine industrial policy.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Digital | Assessment of digital electricity consumption to identify electrical loops | Underestimation of electricity consumption by data centres and projected consumption by the digital sector  |
|  Energy | Prioritising the uses of local biomass | Need to prioritise electrical uses  |
|   |  Main use of hydrogen for industry | Need to systematise the installation of PV on buildings  |
|   |  Development of heating networks | Need for funding for feasibility studies  |
|  Agriculture | Maintain the area of permanent grassland, which represents a large volume of carbon that should not be removed | The need to integrate biofuels and biogas into the agricultural planning document, as potential conflicts of land use and biomass use are to be expected.  |
|   | Reduction in livestock numbers |   |

Comments on the publications and framework documents of the General Secretariat for Ecological Planning (SGPE) – The Shift Project- 2023

It should also be noted that imported emissions (Scope 3) are still not sufficiently taken into account.

# 3. How are energy and climate policies and strategies structured?

The existing tools interact with each other and there is a hierarchy of documents in relation to each other. For example, the local PCAET must be compatible with the regional SRADEET, which in turn must take account of the SNBC. This hierarchy means that national objectives can be applied right down to local level.

However, there is a growing problem: local authorities have to commit to ever more ambitious territorial targets, even though they hold only a small part of the solution in their hands.

The fact is that not all the sectors that emit the most greenhouse gases are within the remit of metropolitan authorities, and even when they are, public policies alone cannot remove all the obstacles. In many cases, the conditions for success in achieving territorial objectives go beyond the mere remit of the metropolis.

Take the example of energy renovation in the private sector: Nantes Métropole has set up a highly effective and ambitious energy renovation support scheme, Mon Projet Renov. The results are very promising. However, the scheme faces a number of obstacles that go beyond the remit of Nantes Métropole: lack of skilled labour, lack of bio-sourced materials, instability of national financial aid, lack of facilitating banking tools, etc. These various levers are as much a matter of regional, national and European level as they are of public institutions and the private sector (banks, businesses, etc.).

Finally, no area depends solely on metropolitan public policy. Every action taken by the metropolis is 'constrained' by the system in which it evolves, by lifestyle habits, by resistance to change, by the legislative context, by societal choices, etc. Achieving carbon neutrality will only be possible if each player takes responsibility and if ambitious, coherent and aligned commitments converge.

|  Regulatory mid-term assessment of Nantes Métropole's Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (2021) | In light of the mid-term assessment of the Climate Plan and in order to address the increasingly pressing climate emergency, amplify its ecological transition action and strengthen its position in the collective fight against the climate crisis within the European Union, in December 2021 Nantes Métropole committed to pursuing the 2050 targets set by the new European Covenant of Mayors.

To guide the community's action in this direction and align with these Covenant of Mayors commitments, in December 2021 the metropolis chose to specify its targets for 2050:
100% renewable energies
carbon neutrality within the metropolis' area of influence.  |
|  Nantes Métropole's green budgeting | This approach involves year analysis of all expenditure at each stage of the budget. It provides year overall vision that progressively integrates all the issues of the ecological transition reference framework, complementing other instruments for measuring ecological performance. This budgeting allows decisions to be made on investment and operating costs, to finance projects that are most in line with the goal of carbon neutrality.  |
|  Evaluating public policies through research | The metropolis is working closely with the Gustave Eiffel University to set up year in-depth evaluation of the Climate Challenges launched as part of the Pilot Cities call for projects, with the aim of monitoring their impact on the behavior of local citizens. This evaluation will be carried out in two stages: firstly, year analysis of the Défis Climate scheme to assess the changes in behavior induced, followed by year ongoing assessment of public policies, ensuring their alignment with the imperative to accelerate the transition.  |
|  Metropolitan-wide climate council | The aim of this council will be to provide a clear and precise analysis of public policies, focusing on certain areas in order to draw up a detailed analysis. The council will bring together a wide range of local players, including private companies, associations and local authorities.  |

# A.2-3: Description of systemic barriers, opportunities and co-benefits

## Barriers

Systemic barriers have emerged as a result of the work carried out by the various working groups. These need to be taken into account if carbon neutrality is to be achieved.

One point that is not to be overlooked is the weight of responsibility for carbon neutrality that is imposed on local decision-makers (in this case, the metropolis). Indeed, the local authority cannot act alone, and the path to carbon neutrality must be taken in concert with decision-makers at other levels. This includes regional, national and European players, without whom carbon neutrality cannot be achieved. For this reason, the carbon strategy for 2030 must be established at all levels, and a strategy must be drawn up by all players, not just local authorities. With larger-scale strategies, all stakeholders and citizens will be involved in the process, and it is only in this way that the objective can be achieved.

The local authority has identified a number of financial obstacles to implementing the carbon neutrality trajectory. Achieving the energy transition and then carbon neutrality would place too great a financial burden on the local authority, which would not have enough funding on its own to make up for the investment required. So this second point ties in with the first: carbon neutrality must be achieved in concert with the other players, or it will not be achieved at all. More specifically, the financial burden of the technologies needed to achieve carbon neutrality weighs too heavily on local authorities' portfolios: carbon sinks, in particular, represent a significant cost for local authorities, while the electrification of the car fleet represents a major challenge both in financial terms and in terms of the timeframe for its development. These measures are necessary, but because of their cost and timeframe, they could jeopardise the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2030. Similarly, the human resources available to local authorities to work on these issues are too limited.

What's more, to achieve a fair and successful ecological transition, profound changes in behavior are essential. A major challenge lies in the need to change the behavior of both community players and citizens, so that the ecological transition is integrated as a fundamental pillar of every initiative within the metropolis. At present, although citizen involvement is on the increase, significant tensions remain over the implementation of new measures to promote carbon neutrality. This resistance could jeopardize the success of the transition, which depends on the support and involvement of all citizens. Nantes Métropole is actively involved in these issues to facilitate a transition that is fairer, more equitable and accepted by all.

In a global context of rising energy prices, households are increasingly vulnerable. In fact, we can see that individual homes in the region are not very efficient, resulting in high energy costs that are directly passed on to households. Inhabitants on modest incomes face the risk of energy insecurity, and as a result, households are unable to commit to year ecological and energy transition when they are already unable to keep themselves adequately heated. There is therefore a real need to work on supporting low-

NET ZERO CITIES

income households in their energy and ecological transition. However, to date, public action has focused too much on curative rather than preventive measures, so it is now necessary to remedy this imbalance and support households upstream to avoid having to manage a situation in year emergency. We can see that it is necessary to prepare and build the transition for and with the most fragile households, to enable them to make a fair transition.

In the fight against climate change, adaptation and mitigation strategies can sometimes seem to contradict each other. While adaptation seeks to reduce the harmful consequences of climate change on communities and ecosystems, it can often result in solutions that maintain or even reinforce the practices that are driving this change, such as continued reliance on fossil fuels. This creates a direct tension with mitigation efforts, which aim to reduce these polluting emissions at source. This competition of objectives highlights the complex challenge of ecological transition. What's needed is real consultation and support to build the transition together. What's more, the overlapping of objectives can hinder the ecological transition dynamic, with some goals aiming to reduce consumption while others require material transformation. Even within climate change mitigation, there is sometimes a lack of convergence between short-, medium- and long-term objectives.

The rebound effect is characterized by year increase in consumption linked to a reduction in another area. This rebound effect can have serious adverse effects on our economy and climate. It is therefore necessary to identify possible rebound effects of the measures applied, in order to try to control them. This barrier to change can therefore be transformed into a real opportunity if taken into account from the right angle.

The electrification of the grid represents a major transition towards more sustainable energy sources. However, this transition requires a large quantity of resources (water, rare metals, etc.). The finite nature of these resources in the face of growing demand and the environmental impact of their extraction and processing are major challenges that need to be addressed globally as quickly as possible.

## Opportunities

Over and above the systemic barriers listed above, there are a number of opportunities linked to the ecological transition that will enable a fairer and more sustainable transition to be made and new ways of thinking and doing things to be developed.

First and foremost, the ecological transition allows for strong and close collaboration between the various stakeholders in an area. As part of the Climate City Contract, Nantes Métropole has introduced a new way of working by bringing together the various stakeholders in the area around a common objective: achieving carbon neutrality for a fairer, healthier and more sustainable city. This new work cycle means that the various players no longer work in silos, but can create a common dynamic and generate synergies and

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract

NET ZERO CITIES

opportunities.

Similarly, the city is striving to share its vision for the city with its citizens and to take account of their aspirations and demands. In this way, action plans and public policies are directly derived from the recommendations made by citizens during the Great Debates and the Climate Challenges.

Nantes Métropole is committed to putting the conversion of industries at the heart of its transition. The principle of the double loop is an inspiring concept for achieving this: in a context of socio-ecological vulnerability, communities must be capable of transforming their previous structures and ways of doing things in order to build a new world based on sustainable growth. This means organising the decline of the current dominant system while encouraging and supporting the emerging system, hence the concept of double transition.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 11 - Representation of the double-loop system

The ecological transition will also bring the places of production and consumption closer together, something that has tended to disappear with globalisation. The metropolis has set itself the goal of relocating certain activities; relocating energy production, for example, is a real opportunity within the framework of the transition to restore sovereignty to the region. With this in mind, Nantes Métropole has set a target of consuming 100% renewable energy and producing 50% local energy by 2050. This will not only lead to better management of resources, but will also enable the region to regain its autonomy and work more closely with neighbouring regions (regional alliance).

What's more, bringing the places where people live closer to the places where they consume and rebuilding around neighbourhoods will strengthen local solidarity. The transition is therefore an

opportunity to rethink the city in order to rebuild lifestyles and move towards a more balanced lifestyle and better health.

## Co-benefits

Climate policies have many co-benefits, all of which lead to an improvement in quality of life and well-being. For example :

policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions lead to an improvement in air quality due to the associated reduction in atmospheric pollutants co-emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels
climate policies that lead to a modal shift away from private cars towards walking and conventional or electrically-assisted bicycles, modes that are described as active because they involve physical activity, reduce sedentary lifestyles and the risk of cardiovascular disease and premature mortality.
greening food policies help to mitigate the destruction of biodiversity, reduce the world's need for cultivated land and reduce the risk of non-infectious diseases (Garnett 2016) - the development of renewable energies reduces vulnerability to energy supply and strengthens energy security

Figure 12 – Co-benefits of ecological transition (Source : Karlsonn et al. 2020)

The literature shows that co-benefits can act as a lever for the adoption of climate policies and increase the acceptability of climate policies and people's willingness to pay to combat global warming (Longo et al., 2012).

Energy renovation is a perfect example of a virtuous action with multiple co-benefits:

reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation)
combating fuel poverty (social justice)
improving winter AND summer comfort for users (adaptation)
installation of renewable energy
creation of local jobscarbon storage via bio-based materials
consolidation of a local biobased materials industry.

Similarly, nature-based solutions are proving to be beneficial for the climate (carbon storage), for adapting to climate change (cool islands, shading, combating drought, etc.), for biodiversity, for human health (air quality, mental health), etc. These solutions are called "no-regrets" because they have only positive impacts.

The diagram below shows the extent to which climate policies offer numerous and cascading co-benefits for human and environmental health.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 13 – Health and climate : co-benefits

For example, climate policies that lead to a modal shift from private car use to walking and conventional or electrically-assisted cycling - modes that are described as active because they involve physical activity - reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity rates, and improve the mental health of users.

They reduce ambient noise, which in turn improves people's mental health. Similarly, the development of active modes of transport will help to reduce urban heat islands, which in turn will reduce the mortality rate in the event of extreme heat. By also reducing the consumption of fossil fuels, active modes of transport improve air quality, leading to a reduction in cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness and cancer.

Finally, reducing the use of fossil fuels leads to a reduction in GHG emissions and mitigation of climate change, with co-benefits in terms of mortality in the event of extreme weather events, UV-related skin cancers and the spread of disease.

Moreover, the results show that the co-benefits of climate policies can partially (Syri et al. 2001, van Vuuren et al. 2006, Woollacott 2018, Chang et al. 2020) or completely (Thompson et al. 2016, Kim et al. 2020) offset the costs of reducing GHG emissions, particularly in the context of 1.5 to 2°C trajectories (Markandya et al. 2018, Vandyck et al. 2018, Xie et al. 2018, Sampedro et al. 2020).

|  Total | 2390 | 1701 | 71 % | 689 | 29 % | 478 | 20 % | 211 | 9 %  |

Table A2.4 shows a 71% reduction in GHG emissions compared with 2030. However, Nantes Métropole is aiming for an 80% reduction in line with the principle of carbon neutrality, based on the fact that French national specificities such as the decarbonization of nuclear-generated electricity will make it possible to close the gap.

## A.3-3: Description / visualization of the participatory model of the climate-neutral city

Implementing the transition to climate neutrality in Nantes Métropole relies on unprecedented citizen involvement, going beyond the traditional framework of technological solutions to include a social and participative dimension. With this in mind, the Climate Challenges have emerged as a powerful lever for mobilization and collective action. Launched in response to Net Zero Cities' "30 Pilot Cities" Call for Projects,

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract
Page 31
Nantes Métropole

Climate City Contract

NET ZERO CITIES

these challenges offer a unique platform for residents to actively contribute to the ecological transition. This project is a perfect example of an ideal participatory model for a climate-neutral metropolis.

The Défis Climat (Climate Challenges) are based on the principle of citizen participation. Citizens taking part in the workshops organised by Nantes Métropole are invited to choose the theme or themes that best suit them (energy, waste, food, digital, leisure, consumption, mobility, water). They can then take part in a collective challenge with a team, or choose to go it alone. Using the "Nantes Métropole climate challenges" app, participants can track their progress, calculate their carbon footprint (with ADEME) and be invited to take part in festive events. Questions posed by the scientific team from the Gustave Eiffel University along the way will provide a better understanding of the obstacles encountered by citizens on their way to carbon neutrality and help influence future public policies.

Nantes Métropole has been organising major debates for a number of years, with a view to including citizens in the consultation and co-construction of policies. Alongside the Great Debates on "Nantes, the Loire and us" in 2015 and "Longevity, opening up the possibilities", Nantes Métropole has proposed two Great Debates on energy and climate: "The energy transition, it's us" in 2017 and "Building our cities, together, inventing tomorrow's life" in 2023. The aim of these democratic events is to give the city's driving forces - residents, experts, local decision-makers and civil society players - the opportunity to speak out, contribute and propose new ways of doing things. The participatory model of the climate-neutral city, as conceptualised through the Great Debates organised by Nantes Métropole, embodies an innovative approach to urban policy-making. By encouraging open and inclusive dialogue, the Great Debates provide an opportunity to collectively explore ways of achieving a resilient and environmentally-friendly city. The proposals that emerge from these discussions are subjected to rigorous analysis and serve as the basis for the development of public policies. This participatory process gives citizens a central role in defining the city's strategic orientations, thereby strengthening the legitimacy and effectiveness of the decisions taken. By placing citizen involvement at the heart of its governance, Nantes Métropole is part of a dynamic of democratic innovation, where cooperation and consultation are the driving forces behind sustainable and inclusive urban transformation. The actions devised by citizens during these Major Debates have been incorporated into the action sheets of the PCAET and the Climate City Contract, demonstrating the deep involvement of citizens, who are directly involved in drawing up the city's major measures and future public policies.

Nantes Métropole's participatory model transcends citizen consultation to encompass all the players involved in the territory, fostering a collaborative, integrated and holistic approach. To this end, a close partnership with the world of research has been initiated, setting up several work cycles, notably in connection with the Défis Climate. Institutions such as the Université Gustave Eiffel are collaborating with Nantes Métropole to analyze the data generated by the Défis Climate. The aim of this collaboration with the academic world is not only to evaluate the system put in place, but also to capitalize on the lessons learned from the approach about the brakes and levers on behavioral change. This partnership between Nantes

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract

NET ZERO CITIES

Métropole and the world of research is year essential pillar for a better understanding of socio-environmental dynamics, effectively guiding initiatives aimed at building a more sustainable future. It also offers invaluable perspectives for guiding policies and actions in favor of ecological transition.

For their part, the workshops at the bifurcation enabled the construction of projects by and for local players: players from associations, local authorities and private companies established in the area. These workshops also provided year opportunity to continue Nantes Métropole's collaborative and holistic approach to working with its stakeholders. As explained above, these workshops brought together players who were not accustomed to working together, and enabled them to create projects in which they would be both players and beneficiaries. This collective work is helping to bring about change for certain players who will no longer have a place in a low-carbon world, and it is therefore necessary to support them in this transition to climate neutrality: in this way, a fair and sustainable transition for all can really be put in place.

In terms of governance, Nantes Métropole is to launch a Climate Council. The launch of such a Council marks a decisive step in the transformation of a metropolis towards climate neutrality. This Council will enable us to deepen our dialogue with stakeholders, and will provide a forum for ongoing dialogue to enrich the public policies and projects carried out in the area.

Work on the prefiguration of this council began in spring 2024, based on the bifurcation workshops. It is continuing to finalise the mandate and composition of the council. The council will be set up in 2025, as soon as the new PCAET is adopted by the Metropolitan Council. It will thus join the community's already active open governance bodies.

Its main tasks will be to:

Monitor the implementation of structuring and partnership-based actions under the 2024-2030 PCAET,
Identify initiatives and provide inspiration.

The Rendez-Vous Climat will also bring the PCAET to life: organised with local stakeholders every 2 years since 2011, they will be stepped up to annual intervals.

Discussions within the Council will be in-depth, allowing the various aspects of the fight against climate change to be explored in depth. The aim will be not only to identify best practice and the most innovative solutions, but also to understand the social, economic and environmental implications of each decision taken. By giving a voice to all stakeholders, the Council will promote an inclusive and balanced approach to the transition to climate neutrality.

The guidelines drawn up by this Council will have a significant impact, influencing the policies and actions of the city as well as private stakeholders. These guidelines will be based on a solid consensus and a shared understanding of the issues, which will strengthen their legitimacy and effectiveness. The Climate Council's holistic approach reflects recognition of the complexity of the climate challenges and the need for an integrated response. By involving all strata of society, this Council will foster genuine collective mobilisation in favour of a sustainable and resilient future. Ultimately, it embodies the spirit of collaboration and commitment needed to meet the challenge of climate change and build a better future for all.

# 4. Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

## B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

To build its carbon neutrality scenario, Nantes Métropole has combined the elements of its diagnosis with the aspirations and proposals of the region's stakeholders and citizens.

The proposed strategy should make it possible to achieve carbon neutrality while meeting the expectations of the area's stakeholders, and to build together a healthier, fairer, more sustainable and more resilient city in the face of climate change.

## Findings

### Mitigation

In 2021, metropolitan France's overall emissions will account for 6,653 kt of greenhouse gases.
60% of these emissions are "imported" from outside the area for our activities and consumption (food, tourism, digital, goods and services, etc.). This is known as Scope 3.
Of the 40% of emissions within the region, 46% come from the transport sector and 38% from buildings (including 24% from the residential sector and 14% from the tertiary sector). Industry emits almost 10%. The industrial and tertiary sectors are the only two sectors for which there has been a reduction in energy consumption since 2003.
Nantes Métropole's areas of responsibility that emit the most greenhouse gases are waste (55%), heating networks (21%) and urban transport (12%).
Nantes Métropole's natural carbon sinks store 32 kteqCO2 per year, which represents 1% of the territory's GHG emissions.

### Adaptation

The summer of 2022 was unprecedented in terms of heat waves and drought: local temperatures reached 42°C and the Loire-drinking water sector was placed in crisis 1 (level 4/4) during the summer period.

A survey of 1,300 people in Nantes after the summer heatwave revealed that:
40% of people said they were physically affected by the heat,
35% found the heat inside their homes unbearable,
50% of people in Nantes felt that their neighbourhoods were unbearable in the heat.
In its 1st report in 2022, the regional IPCC predicted the following situation in the Pays de la Loire region:
Average temperatures are expected to rise by around 1.5°C in 60 years, with the increase reaching 2°C to 2.5°C in 2055 in the worst-case scenario. With such a rise, Nantes
would have average annual temperatures equivalent to those in Biarritz.
In the absence of effective mitigation measures, we can expect an additional 18 to 27 days of heat waves over the next thirty years, and 49 to 69 days over the
period 2071-2100.

Precipitation will intensify and increase in the summer, and decrease in intensity and fall in the winter.

## What vision for Nantes in 2030?

"It's essential to fight for the ecology and for social progress at the same time, because we know that the consequences of global warming will affect the most vulnerable more severely and more quickly than the rest of the population.

Because global warming will be a huge accelerator of social inequality, progress towards a more ecological world necessarily involves a challenge of solidarity and equality.

Awareness of the urgency of climate change, and the desire to take concrete action, are now widespread in our society. That's the whole point of this climate plan, which we want to be "popular": to awaken, federate, recognise and support the will to act that exists in our society, this citizen mobilisation that can undoubtedly make as much of a difference as the millions of euros we are investing in infrastructure".

Johanna Rolland
Présidente of Nantes Métropole

Tristan Riom
Vice-Président of Nantes Métropole

In order to achieve the objective of carbon neutrality in the metropolitan area, it is necessary to massively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by prioritising the sectors that have the greatest impact (transport, residential, industry, etc.), while at the same time increasing carbon storage capacity via natural carbon sinks. The principle of sobriety is seen as a prerequisite, and particular attention must be paid to imported resources and emissions.

Convinced that the collective dynamic and the mobilisation of citizens are essential drivers of the transition, Nantes Métropole wishes to propose a new "popular" PCAET and CCC and encourage changes in behaviour.

Finally, Nantes Métropole wishes to put in place a new, more ambitious strategy for adapting to climate change and move towards a public policy approach to enable climate change to be taken into account in a structural way and accelerate the in-depth transformation of the territory.

The elected representatives of the metropolitan area have also chosen to concentrate human, technical and financial resources more strongly at the interface of the areas of action deemed to be priorities in the short term for responding to the climate emergency: urban planning, biodiversity, water, health and agriculture.
Resilience actions to improve the region's robustness in crisis management will also be stepped up.

## The action plan

The energy transition is based on the triptych Sobriety-Efficiency-Renewables. This means taking complementary action on sobriety (reducing consumption), energy efficiency (more performance while consuming less) and the development of renewable energy production.

Based on this triptych, Nantes Métropole's 2024-2030 PCAET and CCC aim, in an unprecedented way, to :

Make energy and climate issues accessible to as many people as possible: the aim is to propose a "popular" climate plan that democratises the subject among

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract
Page 36
different audiences, popularises the technical content and strengthens information and awareness-raising.

Develop a "resources" approach to broaden the debate: save common goods (water, soil, etc.) and take into account imported emissions, which account for 60% of our global emissions.
Preserve and significantly develop natural carbon sinks to achieve a balance between residual GHG emissions and absorptions.

In order to embody the narrative around the ecological transition and the vision advocated for the territory by 2030, the CCC's climate actions have been organized according to the city's strategic objectives, namely :

encouraging behavioral change = a popular Climate Plan and Climate City Contract
reduce our needs = sobriety
reduce imported emissions = resources
improve the energy mix with 20% local renewable energy production by 2030 and 100% renewable energy consumption by 2050
preserve and develop natural carbon sinks
adapt the region to climate change and make it more resilient

The portfolio of actions by strategic objective is detailed in table B 2.1.

In table B 1.1 below, in line with the template and the Economic Model of NZC, we have deliberately decided to present the actions by emissions sector. This classification makes it easier to read for the players involved and specialists in each sector, who can at a glance scan the actions planned in their field of expertise. This presentation also makes it easier to identify the expected direct carbon impacts by sector or sub-sector, and to highlight the weight of each sector in relation to the others. It goes without saying that the vision of Nantes Métropole 2030 will only be achieved through the implementation of all these actions, across all sectors.

# B.1-2: Description of impact pathways

Achieving carbon neutrality in the Nantes Métropole area implies maximum GHG emissions of around 340 kteqCO2 in 2030. This figure corresponds to a  $55\%$  reduction in energy consumption between now and 2050 (in line with Ademe Transition(s) 2050 scenarios 1 and 2) and the fact that the energy consumed has a low carbon content (60gCO2/kWh compared with 250gCO2/kWh today).

Conversely, carbon neutrality implies "cancelling out" the residual GHG emissions by storing them in carbon sinks. The city's policy guidelines and Ademe scenarios 1 and 2 advocate a preference for natural carbon sinks rather than technical carbon sinks (with the exception of bio-sourced materials). By 2030, it will therefore be necessary to be able to store 340 kteqCO2.

The majority of greenhouse gas emissions in the metropolitan area come from the transport and building (and heating) sectors, so it was important and necessary for Nantes Métropole to reduce these sectors as a structural priority.

In fact, the tertiary, residential and road transport sectors alone account for 82% of the region's emissions, so it seems necessary to tackle these sectors as a matter of priority.

With this in mind, the city has decided to take strong action in these areas, including the renovation of 10,000 homes per year, which represents a doubling of the target previously set in the city's guide documents. Or reducing the share of carbon-based mobility in the road transport sector.

The action choices made by the metropolis are therefore aimed directly at the sectors that emit the most greenhouse gases: transport and buildings.

# Feasibility of the trajectory :

The actions in the Action Plan (see portfolio B.2) have been calibrated to enable the figures given in the tables above to be achieved. The trajectory can only be followed through the implementation of the Action Plan. The support of Europe, via the Mission City, the alignment of international and national legislation, and the mobilization of substantial financial capital are essential for the realization of this Action Plan and the achievement of Nantes Métropole's ambitious objectives.

# In terms of offsetting the 340 kteqC02 of residual emissions, Nantes Métropole wishes to rely solely on natural carbon sinks (including bio-sourced materials).

Action 53 of the portfolio consists in "creating a structure to store carbon" in order to calibrate the mechanisms to be mobilized (aggregation of private financing to be redistributed in carbon storage projects, additional financing system...). This project is in the prefiguration phase.

It should be noted that the carbon and ecological resilience structure's scope of action extends beyond Nantes Métropole, whose storage potential is limited: neighboring communities, the Nantes St Nazaire Metropolitan Cluster and even the Loire Atlantique department.

The implementation of these numerous actions will also lead to year overall improvement in health in the metropolitan area, with year improvement in air quality and a shift towards active modes of transport (cycling, walking, etc.). The overhaul of town centers and the upgrading of neighborhoods will enable the development of a strong social bond between citizens.

A detailed description of each action is presented in module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design, with cobenefits and implementation timetable for each action, and if available, the cost per action and the reduction in terms of greenhouse gases.

These actions are the fruit of collaborative work with all Nantes Métropole's stakeholders: private companies, associations, local authorities and institutions, as well as all Nantes Métropole and Ville de Nantes technicians, to enable in-depth work. At the same time, the metropolis has drawn up its 2024-2030 Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan (PCAET), so the actions in the PCAET action plan are the same as the actions in this action plan. This makes it possible to send out a strong message of involvement both at national level with the PCAET and at European level with this Climate City Contract.

In part B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design, the metropolis has chosen to classify its actions by major policy areas, to make the issues easier to read and understand, whereas in the previous part the actions

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract
Page 50
Nantes Métropole
Climate City Contract
NET ZERO CITIES

were grouped by major decarbonization areas. This choice was made to ensure better political support and greater consistency of the issues at stake across the metropolitan area.

In addition, year adaptation section has been added to the portfolio of actions; indeed, the metropolis has a Climate Change Adaptation unit within its Ecological Transition Department. This makes it possible to work in depth on the issues involved in climate programming. The metropolis has therefore also chosen to present here the key actions of the PCAET Adaptation action plan, to demonstrate its real commitment and the consideration it gives to all aspects of the ecological transition.

The table in module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning provides a complete breakdown of all the actions relevant to this plan. It describes the desired indicators and targets for each individual project.

# B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

The actions highlighted in the table above are those chosen by the elected representatives to become the flagship initiatives of the action plan. These actions will be carried out with increased determination, illustrating the strong political will of the metropolis. They are also the initiatives with the greatest potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the region, making a significant contribution to the fight against climate change. As described above, the choice has been made here to classify the actions by major policy areas, to make it easier to understand the issues at stake on a territorial scale.

Similarly, year adaptation section comprising 5 action sheets has been added to the portfolio to enable all aspects of the ecological transition to be taken into account. The key actions are in red in this tab.

B.2-2: Description of each action

# Annexe 1 – Action plan

It has not always been possible to specify the cost of each action for the time being.

Given that Nantes Métropole is aware that this stage will be a prerequisite for any search for funding, it is planned to give priority to working on the cost of the actions in future COTECs. We are also counting on the assistance of city finance specialists.

# B.2-3: Summary of strategies for residual emissions

The political vision adopted for the reduction of residual emissions favours natural carbon sinks, as outlined in Ademe's scenarios 1 and 2. With this in mind, Nantes Métropole aims first to achieve a significant reduction in emissions, and then to offset the remaining emissions by using these natural carbon sinks. However, this approach does not take into account existing and future technological solutions for carbon sequestration.

This strategy therefore excludes any consideration of technological sequestration options. Furthermore, the implementation of sequestration via natural carbon sinks is limited to the scale of the département, as the metropolis does not have sufficient land to diversify its uses, whether for residential purposes, reforestation, livestock farming or agricultural production.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

One of the flagship actions of the action plan is to set up a carbon structure (sheet no. 53): to develop local financing for natural carbon storage and environmental restoration projects, combining private and public funds, while providing advice on assessing carbon stocks. The structure will extend beyond Nantes Métropole, with shared governance to ensure transparency and efficiency.
The Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector is not conventionally included in a territory's total GHG emissions, but is necessary to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. This sector generates both emissions and absorptions of CO2. It enables us to estimate the carbon sinks in a given area, through three flows: forest growth (absorptions), wood harvesting (emissions) and changes in land use (emissions and absorptions) (e.g.: cultivated land that becomes grassland will store carbon, while in the opposite direction, it will release some).

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 19 - Carbon sinks in the region in kteq CO2

In the Nantes Métropole area, carbon sinks grew steadily between 2003 and 2021p (by a factor of 3), despite the artificialization of the land and the harvesting of wood, both of which are sources of emissions. Forest growth is the main source of absorption in the region (2-fold increase between 2003 and 2021p). Wood harvesting has increased on the territory, generating growing emissions (2-fold increase between 2003 and 2021p).

The change in land use varies according to activities and authorizations under local town planning schemes, for example. Over the period 2003-2021p, emissions linked to land use change are stable (around 6 kteqCO2 per year).

Figure 20 - Capture of kTeq CO2 potential to be achieved by 2030
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
In 2021p, the Nantes Métropole LULUCF sector as a whole absorbs 32 kteqCO2. This absorption is not enough to offset the 2,404 kteqCO2 emitted by the various activities in the area.

The ratio of carbon sinks to GHG emissions is around  $1\%$ . This rate is stable over the entire period considered (2003, 2008-2021p).

Today, the metropolis has selected multiple indicators to track its progress towards climate neutrality. Here are the most relevant indicators linked to the action plan. These indicators are already monitored by the metropolis, and are included each year in the sustainable development reports of the Metropolis and the City of Nantes.

The community attaches great importance to monitoring these indicators, aware of their crucial role in assessing and adapting its trajectory. Regular monitoring of these measures by the Direction Animation de la Transition Écologique enables us to identify areas requiring adjustment, and to ensure that the initiatives in place are contributing effectively to achieving our climate neutrality objectives. This rigorous monitoring testifies to the metropolis' commitment to a successful and sustainable ecological transition, while enabling it to report on its progress in a transparent and structured way.

# C.1-2: Description of organizational and governance interventions

The metropolis has introduced new forms of organization and governance to facilitate both horizontal and vertical, as well as sectoral and cross-sectoral interventions. Horizontal interventions foster collaboration between various departments and local players, while vertical interventions ensure cooperation between different levels of governance, from local to national. Sectoral initiatives target specific areas, such as energy or transport, while cross-sectoral interventions integrate several fields for global solutions. This new governance encourages the active participation of all stakeholders, guaranteeing year integrated and adaptive approach to the ecological transition.

# COTEC air-energy-climate

Meeting between Nantes Métropole experts/technicians from all departments. These meetings focused on the public and municipal policies to be put in place. The current cycle began in autumn 2023, with particular focus on the revision of the PCAET and the drafting of the Climate City Contract. Each department is therefore mobilized to promote the ecological transition in all sectors of the economy and implement concrete actions within the community.

# Health and Ecological Transition Division

In year innovative move, Nantes Métropole is reinventing itself as a driver of change, embracing year integrated vision where public health and ecological transition are inseparable. In concrete terms, the local authority is reorganizing its internal structures to merge the departments dedicated to health and ecology, under the guiding principle of "ONE HEALTH". This cross-functional approach aims to create significant synergies between these two fundamental areas, fostering the emergence of a collective dynamic and a shared vision. The main objective of this initiative is to establish a true symbiosis between health and the environment, going beyond the traditional boundaries of public policy to encourage in-depth reflection on the interaction between these two fields. This new approach demonstrates Nantes Métropole's resolute commitment to rethinking existing paradigms and placing sustainability at the heart of its priorities. By adopting a holistic perspective, the metropolis aspires to create a future where the health of the population and ecological balance are intrinsically linked.

# Conseil pour le Climate (Climate Council)

To accompany the Energy Transition roadmap and ensure a follow-up to the Grand Débat, COTE, year open conference on energy transition, was set up in 2018. It delivered a report in June 2021, delivering a mixed assessment of its first mandate.

Following this report, a diagnostic and analysis of stakeholder networks was conducted to define new modalities for open governance on climate issues.

The proposal is to establish a space for ongoing dialogue to enrich public policies and projects in the region. This description fits well with the framework set by the metropolis in 2021 as part of the Metropolitan Citizenship Pact. This new body could join the 25 active open governance bodies in the community.

The main missions proposed for the "Climate Council" would be as follows:

working together, building capacity: monitor the implementation of structuring/partnership actions under the Climate Plan (continuing the work of the Turning point workshops). AURAN could support us in producing data on the actions selected by the Climate Council.
monitoring and forecasting, identifying initiatives and providing inspiration: contribute to the programming of the annual Climate Rendezvous

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract
Nantes Métropole

Climate City Contract

NET ZERO CITIES

These avenues were tested in informal interviews with some of the participants in the Turning point workshops. The missions were generally well perceived by the partners, with a few points of attention: take the time to better define/clarify the objectives, which sometimes still appear vague to some, and be careful to define concrete objects of work: "it's time to take action". In their view, the Climate Council must not be: "a place for lobbying or politics", "blah blah blah", "yet another consultative body producing reports", "a fact-checking body", "a place to promote individual interests".

It is proposed to continue the prefiguration work until the adoption of the PCAET (early 2025) to clarify the mandate, launch the call for participation... and thus be in a position to install the new body in early 2025.

In summary, the Climate Council, a new open governance body, appears necessary for the animation of the territorial climate air energy plan for the following reasons:

Benefiting from local expertise (from committed citizens and partners) is year asset for enriching/improving certain public policy actions.
The challenge of carbon neutrality calls for collective responses and a forward-looking vision, with particular attention to emerging initiatives.
Nantes Métropole needs to animate a network of partners to encourage new local collaborations, with a view to joint responses to national or European calls for projects.

## Pilot Cities – Défis Climate

From 2011 to 2023, the metropolis ran citizen ecological transition challenges for over 2,000 households on 3 themes: food, energy and waste. Led by local associations (Alisée, GAB44, Ecopole and Les boîtes vertes), these challenges really did have the effect of changing participants' habits. At the end of 2022, in connection with the Mission Cities, a call for projects entitled Pilot Cities was opened to support experimental approaches to achieving carbon neutrality. We responded by proposing a new formula for citizen challenges: carbon neutrality challenges.

These new challenges, known as “climate challenges”, aim to help 1,000 households a year move towards a low-carbon lifestyle. This experiment, made possible by European funding, is being carried out with a number of local partners: the Samoa, Nantes University and Dirigeants Responsables Nantes Atlantique for the animation, as well as Gustave Eiffel University for the evaluation and Alisée for the Déclics application.

## LES DÉFIS CLIMAT

Similarly, the city is striving to share its vision for the city with its citizens and to take account of their aspirations and demands. In this way, action plans and public policies are directly derived from the recommendations made by citizens during the Great Debates and the Climate Challenges.

As well as helping citizens to reduce their carbon footprint and change their lifestyles, Nantes Métropole aims, through the Climate Challenges, to gather feedback from citizens and identify the obstacles they face in order to try to remedy them: by working with the partners concerned or by modifying public policies. So, the conclusions and learnings of this study will inform the CCC development and iteration cycles. This evaluation is being carried out by the Gustave Eiffel University as part of the Pilot Cities project.

## Turning Point Workshops

Three monthly meetings were organized to bring together Nantes Métropole's partners. These 3 workshops focused on actions that could be implemented by the partners, while reflecting on how to accompany the current economic system towards its end, while building a new one. This breakdown enabled constructive exchanges between Nantes Métropole's various partners.

Dark Matter Labs and Democratic Society helped us organize and create the workshops on which the participants then worked. This collaboration really enabled us to gain a better understanding of the exchanges as well as a better method of approach. It was in this context in particular that the Double-loop dynamic was evoked to fully integrate the players present in the area. This close collaboration enabled us to make use of the resources available on both sides of the table, and to offer the players present at the various workshops high-quality support and exchanges to help them make the ecological transition that is so necessary in our region today.

The aim of the Turning point workshops was to encourage discussion between local players who are not accustomed to working together, and to include them fully in the ecological transition. It was really about creating projects in the private sphere to make stakeholders actors of change. We received excellent feedback on these workshops, which enabled us to develop projects and bring together people who don't usually rub shoulders.

# Grands Débats (Great Debate)

Nantes Métropole has organized two Grands Débats over the past decade, the first in 2016-2017 focusing on the energy transition, and the second in 2023 dealing with the Fabrique de nos villes. These Grands Débats bring together residents and professionals to discuss how to implement the energy transition, or how to make our cities and live in them in the future. The proposals put forward are then analyzed and examined, so that elected representatives can make commitments and take direction. The aim behind this mobilization is to give citizens a real role in building the metropolis' commitments by consulting them directly.

# Climate and culture

The guiding principle of this Climate City Contract, and the common thread running through Nantes Métropole's climate transition, is a strong political commitment, with the many changes fiercely supported by the city's elected representatives. In this sense, the transition to carbon neutrality is permeating all of the city's competencies and sectors, as can be seen in the case of culture. Nantes Métropole is intrinsically linked with culture, and the community wishes to use this link with culture to promote the transition. Indeed, citizen mobilization is a prerequisite for a successful transition, and this requires a clear understanding of the issues at stake. The metropolis wants to use culture to make the notions of bifurcation and ecological transition more accessible. In particular, through a comic strip that will be written to narrate the ecological transition on the scale of the metropolis, this collaboration with local artists will enable a better appropriation of the subjects by the inhabitants. In addition, the renovation of the Nantes Natural History Museum, scheduled for 2028, will focus on the ecological transition. Indeed, the museum aims to become a major player in a society ready to meet the challenges of climate, biodiversity and ecological transition, with the aim of "living on Earth tomorrow". This change will also provide year opportunity to renovate the building's energy efficiency. In this way, Nantes Métropole is taking on the subjects of transition in a fun and interactive way.

These social innovations have been instrumental in shaping Nantes Métropole's trajectory towards carbon neutrality. Actions within the action plan have directly emerged from the Turning point workshops and the Grand Debates. These innovations have facilitated the creation of connections and networks that previously did not exist, bringing together stakeholders who were not accustomed to collaborating. This collaborative approach has enabled the development of technical and innovative pathways and actions through the cultivation of new ideas.

The Turning point workshops, for example, fostered a collaborative environment where various actors, including local associations, private businesses, and municipal authorities, could converge to address common challenges. This setting encouraged the cross-pollination of ideas, leading to the creation of targeted and effective solutions for the metropolis.

Similarly, the Grand Debates provided a platform for citizens and professionals to engage in meaningful dialogue about energy transition and urban development. The proposals generated from these debates were carefully reviewed by elected officials and integrated into metropolitan policies. This inclusive and participatory process ensured that the actions were not only technically sound but also socially accepted and supported by the community.

Overall, these social innovations have played a crucial role in aligning diverse stakeholders towards a shared vision of a carbon-neutral future, leveraging collective expertise and fostering a culture of cooperation and

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract

Climate City Contract
NET ZERO CITIES

innovation. This collaborative spirit has been essential in developing a robust and dynamic action plan, characterized by technical proficiency and creative solutions.

In the future, all these systems will provide feedback and learning that will be used to improve and develop climate policies (iteration cycle of Climate Plan and CCC).

# 5. Part D – Outlook and next steps

This City Climate Contract 2030 has been drawn up by a central team in collaboration with the various departments of the Metropole and City of Nantes, and also with the stakeholders present in the territory via collaborative working groups. This action plan is based on the action plan of the Metropole's recently renewed 2024-2030 Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan, as well as on green budgeting analyses, which provide decision-making support. The community's actions and responsibilities will be specified, elaborated and detailed in future iterations of this Climate City Contract 2030. The 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan will be updated in greater detail and developed on year ongoing basis, for example when new official governance documents are adopted. Every two years, year updated version will be sent to NetZeroCities and the EU.

Annual monitoring of the city's progress towards a positive climate will be carried out by Nantes Métropole teams.

The process of drawing up the PCAET 2024-2030 has served as a joint effort for the drafting of the Contrat Ville Climate 2030.

The ambition is to link the Contrat Ville Climate 2030 to the regular structures and organization of the Metropole's guiding documents.

|   |  Under the 2019-2025 local housing program, Nantes Métropole's Mon Projet Rénov grants will help 1,000 private homes and condominiums with their energy renovation projects each year. The scheme, set up in partnership with the region's energy transition stakeholders, is aimed at all individuals wishing to carry out renovation work on their home or condominium. In order to achieve the target of 3,500 low-energy consumption homes per year, or at least 35% energy savings, we need to step up our human and financial support for projects, and pay particular attention to the role of biodiversity in project quality.

Deployment renewable energies on local authority property

Energy actions with a short payback period: take action on the maintenance of buildings and equipment. Undertake work campaigns such as insulation, lighting renovation, etc.

Actions on use and floor space: take a more effective approach to the notion of building occupancy by analyzing usage through pilot departments (occupancy rate, awareness, densification, etc.), but also integrate usage more finely into maintenance and explawtation; question the evolution of floor space as we move forward in analyzing the conditions for achieving the objectives of the tertiary sector decree and the challenges of reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  |

Work on the offer to design a territorialized offer by theme and oriented towards VSE-SME users (shopkeepers, craftsmen, ETI...).
From 2022 onwards, the aim is to design this offering around the transition topics deemed to be priorities by the stakeholders of the Nantes metropolitan area's CSR platform. Solutions provided by public stakeholders and private stakeholders of general interest have been targeted. It covers Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) solutions in areas such as: "1st CSR step", sober energy consumption in the tertiary and commercial sectors, sober water consumption, sober land use, biodiversity, photovoltaic production, the mobility pack, local currency, "Solution partage", grouped collection of professional waste (office waste, electrical and electronic equipment (D3E), bio-waste, etc.), responsible digital, etc.). ..., responsible digital technology, zero plastic, territorial sponsorship, inclusive recruitment including the employment of senior citizens, 3rd year internships (and qualifying internships for disadvantaged groups), and gender equality. The aim is to facilitate contact with solution providers, whether public stakeholders or private stakeholders of general interest.

Work on demand to help business groups mobilize their members on transition issues
The aim is to enable business groups to better inform their members about the range of local transition services on offer, to encourage them to take action and to disseminate solutions throughout the metropolis.

Setting up a new financial support scheme for business groups
Nantes Métropole would also like to help business groups to identify the right people in their companies to work with, and to mobilize them to take part in awareness-raising or training sessions on the subject of transitions.
To this end, Nantes Métropole is proposing a new scheme (co-constructed with the CCI Nantes Saint-Nazaire, the CMA de loire-Atlantique, business collectives and local authorities) to provide funding to business collectives, based on a shared roadmap, to animate their member networks on transition topics.
The scheme offers different options to business groups, enabling them to outsource this network management, notably via the CCI Nantes-Saint-Nazaire, or by pooling year employee between two business groups to tackle transition issues collectively.

business collectives (representing 300 members and 15,000 employees) have been involved in this experimental scheme since the end of 2023: Odyssée Jules Verne in Bouguenais, Sainte Luce active, Nant'EST Entreprise, Club Titan, Club Euronantes.

In practical terms, this means putting CSR solution providers (public and private sector organizations whose offerings are deemed to be in the public interest) in touch with the right people in VSEs and SMEs (targeted approach). With all the economic developers based in the local hubs, we are building - together with business collectives - local economic programs on the subjects of transitions and sustainable development. state of progress - to amplify - Planned - To commit | collectives are already keen to get involved in the subjects of transitions, with a priority on mobility, energy, inclusive recruitment...).

additional work is underway on healthcare provision, led by the Public Health Department in conjunction with DUH and DEER.

development strategy:
pursue or initiate studies on central areas and, if necessary, translate them into the PLUm, using tools designed to intensify the city (e.g.: UMa zoning - commercial/tertiary lines - sector-based development and programming guidelines (OAP) - reserved sites)
conduct strategic studies on the development of central areas  |   |   |   |   |   |
|   | - the commercial OAP could evolve to pursue the objective of strengthening neighborhood and town centres, and more tightly control commercial development in major or intermediate centres
continue to reflect on cross-cutting rules to promote functional diversity, such as the reversibility of ground-floor units to encourage the installation of craftsmen or their conversion into artisanal premises, facilitate access to commercial centers by adapting parking and public space rules, and systematically integrate re-emplaw shops.

In addition to action 31 on the development of the local economy in town and neighborhood centers, the Metropole is focusing on controlling the development of retail in major and intermediate commercial centers. The main regulatory tools are
the PLUm, with a thematic OAP for commerce that defines development objectives for these polarities
the definition of urban projects in these commercial areas.

As part of modification no. 2 of the PLUm, which will be approved in early 2025, it has been proposed to reinforce this orientation with a politically validated principle of no increase in retail space in major and intermediate commercial areas.
As part of the metropolitan approach to urban entrances, the DUH is currently examining a number of urban transformation projects for certain major polarities. The implementation of these projects will also support actions 32 and 31.  |

|   |  Nantes Métropole, Le Voyage à Nantes and Nantes Saint Nazaire Développement have jointly drawn up a strategy to promote more sustainable tourism in the metropolitan area. This joint ambition, in a context of transition, reflects the desire to : - adapt to climate change and the increasing scarcity of natural resources ; - meet the new expectations of tourist customers; - respond to recruitment pressures within the industry; - preserve the uniqueness of a region "turned upside down by art and culture" and its positioning as a creative and committed destination. The roadmap, drawn up in consultation with the region's stakeholders, is intended to be highly operational, with the aim of making tourism more sober, inclusive and virtuous. As tourism is a cross-cutting skill, it will necessarily involve strong interactions with many areas of public action: economy, urban development, energy, green spaces, culture, heritage, sport, territorial cooperation, diversity and inclusion, community life, communication, etc. This strategy will also address the issue of travel, in particular by carrying out a study of international and national mobility to and from Nantes.  |   |   |   |   |   |

Success will depend primarily on the mobilization of all internal stakeholders (thematic public policy experts from the 3 structures) and the ability to bring on board external partners and economic stakeholders from the tourism ecosystem (tourist and event sites, hotels, caterers and restaurateurs, retailers, etc.).

To commit | As part of our exemplary approach to energy purchasing, we propose to study the feasibility of applying and exceeding the following territorial targets:

: between 30% and 40

: between 40% and 50

: at least 50%.

year initial purchasing group will be set up to purchase electricity and gas, including renewable energies, with a view to monthly balancing. Scope: municipalities, partners (NMH, Cité des Congrès, SEMITAN, etc.).

In addition, Nantes Métropole, the City of Nantes, TE 44, SEMITAN, SEMINN, the Saint Nazaire Agglo community and the Loire et Sillon community of communes have decided to join forces to pool the award and execution of direct renewable energy purchasing contracts (CADER).

CADERs are renewable energy purchase contracts signed directly between a producer and year end consumer. They represent year alternative to the energy supply contracts used until now, in that they enable end consumers to purchase renewable energy from a producer over a long period of time, and for a pre-determined price. The first CADER is scheduled for 2024.

This approach is also part of the OSER project (Outil de Simulation de systèmes multi-Énergies Renouvelables Patrimonial): a 30-month project in response to year ADEME call for projects. The aim is to simulate energy scenarios in order to diagnose the coverage of renewable energy needs as close as possible to real time. Scope : BATII (VdN, NM and CCAS)  |

|   |  52. Consume ⅓ less agricultural, natural and forest space than the PLUm 2019 target  |   |   |   |   |   |
|  key contextual factors
• In 2022, there will be 30,438 ha of natural, agricultural and forest areas (ENAF) in metropolitan France, i.e. 57% of the territory.
• Since 2004, there has been a significant drop in the annual rate of consumption of ENAF: 2004-2014: 166.8 ha/year 2014-2018: 106 ha/year 2018-2022: 56.5 ha/year
• Action 36 marker 2 of the "Grand débat Fabrique de nos villes" roadmap
indicators and goals
• figures from Nantes | Description of the action  |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |  The 2019 PLUm has included in its Projet d'Aménagement et de Développement Durable (PADD) a target to reduce the annual rate of ENAF consumption by 50% by 2030 compared with the 2004-2014 period, i.e. to expect year annual ENAF consumption rate of 83.4 ha/year in 2030.
Action n°51 therefore proposes to set a target to reduce the rate of annual ENAF consumption to 56 ha/year by 2030, i.e. ⅓ less than the initial target.
Action n°51, consists in continuing the reduction in the rate of ENAF consumption observed for two decades now, notably through reducing the consumption of spaces in extension of the urban envelope, amplifying urban renewal, optimizing density, and protecting agricultural, natural and forested spaces.  |   |   |   |   |   |

|   |  • Areas for development Against a backdrop of climate change and rising temperatures, the city's morphology, mineral nature and anthropogenic sources of heat (vehicles, air conditioning) release heat accumulated during the day at night: this is the Urban Heat Island phenomenon, characterized at night by a temperature difference of up to 10°C between the city and the surrounding countryside. During extreme weather conditions such as heatwaves, the city during the day can also be characterized by situations of thermal discomfort, degrading quality of life and potentially having year impact on people's health. During the day, people's experience of heat varies from one individual to another, ranging from simple discomfort to heat stress (dizziness, heavy sweating, etc.). In certain situations, thermal distress can lead to loss of consciousness or death. At high night-time temperatures, particularly during tropical nights (a night when the temperature never drops below 20 degrees), the body can no longer recharge its batteries, with a long-term impact on the physical and mental health of individuals. To adapt to the heat and limit its impact on health, we need to offer people places where they can cool off and stay hydrated: this is the principle behind the Urban Freshness Islands, i.e. outdoor spaces in the city accessible to all, which we need to develop.  |   |   |   |

|   |  • Areas for development Regional planning is based on a certain number of rules and prescriptions in terms of urban planning and housing, as set out in the Plan Local d'Urbanisme Métropolitain (PLum), which sets out a vision of how our cities should look by 2030. This horizon requires us to take into account major ecological issues such as climate change, which seems to be evolving more rapidly. When it comes to climate change, the city is where the problems are concentrated (the urban heat island phenomenon accentuates urban overheating, while soil sealing favors inodization through runoff, etc.), yet the solutions to be implemented, such as nature-based solutions, also aim to preserve health and improve quality of life. This intersection between climate change and health underscores the need to develop integrated approaches between different issues (e.g. climate, air, noise). For example, the current PLUm mentions cross-cutting actions such as "Îlots de ressourcement", i.e. local spaces with micro-climatic, sound, olfactory and landscape qualities conducive to the well-being of residents.  |   |   |   |

**• Tool / device**
The current PLUm (20219 -2030) needs to be strengthened with a view to urban planning that is adapted to climatic hazards and promotes environmental health. The PLUm 2019 - 2030 is already part of this dynamic, as the Sustainable Planning and Development Project indicates that taking nuisances and pollution into account in the organization of urban development takes place at different scales and interacts with other environmental dimensions (energy, biodiversity, climate change...).

The aim today is to strengthen the constituent parts of the PLUm, to make them interact with each other and reinforce their practical scope.

The PLUm will have to be brought into line with the PCAET.  |

In this context, the city, due to its morphology and mineral nature, releases the heat accumulated during the day at night: this is the Urban Heat Island phenomenon (night-time temperatures in the city are higher than in the surrounding countryside, by up to 10°). In extreme climatic conditions such as heatwaves, the city presents situations of thermal discomfort during the day that are difficult for individuals to bear. Heat has a health impact on the body, most often in the form of thermal stress (heavy sweating, dizziness, etc.), but can also lead to "heat stroke" (malaise, even death).

By teaming up with the Institut de Recherche en Sciences et Techniques de la Ville - IRSTV - whose laboratories in Nantes work on urban micro-climatology, Nantes Métropole's objective is to contribute to the development and long-term installation of a climate observatory for the city and then the Nantes metropolitan area. year observatory capable of providing professionals and the public alike with fine-scale meteorological parameters such as air temperature, humidity and wind speed, and whose data can be grouped together in a single, public database, as yet non-existent.

These physical measurements from the Urban Micro-Climatology Observatory will complement information on the practices, usage and perceptions of Nantes' residents from a large-scale survey (sample of 1,300 people) carried out following the scorching summer of 2022.

**Tool / device**

The aim is to establish a partnership between IRSTV and Nantes Métropole to set up year urban micro-climate observatory. IRSTV has the expertise and research experience to co-construct this observatory.

IRSTV already has a number of measurement stations in Nantes, installed as part of research projects (VegDUD, Urbio, Urbinat) or at year observation site called ONEVU (Observatoire Nantais des Environnements Urbains) located in the northeast quarter of the city of Nantes.

This observatory will be set up by pooling human, technical and financial resources. In particular, it will be based on a public health project called Synopse, which aims to structure public health data (temperature being considered as a factor influencing the health of populations).  |

A weak risk culture and the loss of memory of past events make a region's population more vulnerable to future crises. In the face of climate change, strengthening the culture and memory of risk is year essential factor in resilience.
The local authority has already launched a number of initiatives to raise awareness of the risk of flooding, as part of its Flood Prevention Action Plan for the Loire Aval (PAPI loire Aval), aimed at the general public: installation of 8 historical flood markers, 3 information panels and a water level gauge. These installations will continue in the coming years with "inodation" trails, information on historic floods on the Nantes patrimonia website, and a project for year artistic work to raise awareness of inodations in Nantes public spaces. The "Risques Inodation" school program for local schools has raised awareness among more than 1,500 pupils, and will continue over the next few years. Nantes métropole also supports the "Mobiliser les Imaginaires pour l'Adaptation par les Médiations scientifiques et culturelles" (MIAM) collective, working in the fields of adaptation to climate change and risks.  |   |   |   |

# Annex 2 – French cities framework

The memo is presenting the French framework and context in which French cities build their Climate City Contract (CCC) for the Cities Mission. All acronyms are in French and full names are in English for a better understanding. At the end of the document, a glossary recaps acronyms in French and English. This memo is a working document which is not exhaustive.

## 1. Cities vs metropolitan areas

The status of metropolis was created in France as part of the reform of local authorities in December 2010. The aim was to boost the attractiveness and influence of major cities. There are 22 metropolises in France and four of French mission cities participate as a metropolis: Nantes, Bordeaux, Dijon and Grenoble. Angers and Dunkerque are urban communities but it is very close to the metropolises, so we will talk about metropolitan areas for these six towns. Metropolitan areas are larger than cities because they gather several municipalities working together on a joint urban development and land-use planning project. Paris, Lyon and Marseille are also part of metropolises but they responded to the call for expression of interest of the Mission within the perimeter of the municipality.

Metropolitan areas exercise the powers transferred to them by their municipalities. Consequently according to the Maptam law (2014), metropolises are in charge of these policies on all their territories :

Urban policy,
Urban planning,
Local housing policy,
Protection and enhancement of the environment and living environment policy,
Economic, social and cultural development,
Management of services of public interest (for instance transport).

Before the Maptam law, this was the responsibility of the municipalities. The division of roles and responsibilities between cities and metropolitan areas can sometimes be unclear. It depends on each city and metropolitan area.

Metropolitan areas are responsible for urban planning and climate planning. The French framework detailed below only concerns metropolitan areas, as the cities have delegated this responsibility to them. But metropolitan areas work with cities.

Moreover, metropolitan areas are a subcategory of a specific French status concerning cooperation between municipalities called public establishments for intercommunal cooperation (EPCI). In 2024, there are 1,254 EPCI including 22 metropolises and 14 urban communities.

## 2. National, regional and local strategies for low-carbon targets

### National low-carbon strategies and laws

The energy transition law for green growth (LTECV, 2015) requires France to draw up a roadmap to fight global warming. The French climate plan (2017) strengthened targets of the energy transition law for green growth, to be compatible with the Paris agreement (carbon neutrality in 2050).
The national low-carbon strategy (SNBC, 2015 - SNBC 2, 2020) is the French roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and reducing the carbon footprint of French consumption. It sets out guidelines for implementing the transition to a low-carbon, circular and sustainable economy. The SNBC defines a trajectory in all sectors of activity for reducing greenhouse gas emissions until 2050 and sets short- and medium-term targets (carbon budgets). It has two ambitions: to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and to reduce the carbon footprint of French people. The national low-carbon strategy must be taken into account by local decision-makers at every scale, particularly when drawing up local climate plans because it is a legal obligation for local authorities. This national strategy also is the reference base to build the multi-annual energy plan (PPE, 2016 - PPE 2, 2020).

In addition to the low-carbon strategy, a national climate change adaptation plan (PNACC) defines concrete actions to adapt French territories to climate change.

## Ecological planning

The Carbon print is addressed by the national strategy called "ecological planning" (among other issues that are also targeted: adaptation to climate change, biodiversity...). The strategy aims to:

translate national objectives (reduction in CO2 emissions) into concrete, coherent and achievable measures (number of electric vehicles, building renovation surface areas, etc.)
translate national objectives into local action, according to the specificities of each territory.

Objectives and action plans are defined by a dialogue between State and Region with the intermediary of regional COP (inspired by the international Conference of the parties system). Cities and metropolitan areas are not involved in the process. Every region launched their COP, except Ile de France and Bretagne regions but they will do it soon.

Regional COPs are following 3 steps:

Diagnosis phase
Debate phase with citizens, economic actors and local authorities
Regional roadmap

All COPs are currently in the diagnosis phase.

## 3. Regional level

The regional scheme for planning and sustainable development of territories (SRADDET) is the main document for French regions concerning ecological transition. The SRADDET is elaborated and voted by the regional council but the regional prefect (representative of the State in each region) must approve the document. It defines mid-term and long-term targets in many areas, including air quality, the fight against climate change, energy management and recovery, the development of renewable and recovered energy sources, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity. The SRADDET must follow the national low-carbon strategy. Then, the SRADDET objectives apply to local planning documents such as the PCAET, SCoT, PLU, etc. Indirectly, national objectives are implemented at the local level, via the regional level.

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract
Page 181
Local level

Territorial climate, air and energy plan (PCAET)
The territorial climate, air and energy plan is a strategic and operational planning tool to deal with climate, air and energy issues in a territory. It is mandatory for public establishments for intercommunal cooperation (EPCI) with more than 20,000 inhabitants. Moreover, municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants must draw up year assessment of GHG emissions every 3 years and set up year action plan to reduce them. They can integrate their greenhouse gas emissions assessment and their transition plan into this territorial climate, air and energy plan.
Every French city from the Cities Mission is concerned by a territorial climate, air and energy plan.
The objectives of the plan are:
To reduce the territory's greenhouse gas emissions ("mitigation" component);
To adapt the territory to the effects of climate change, in order to reduce its vulnerability ("adaptation" component);
To decrease energy consumption, improve energy efficiency and develop renewable energies.
The document is divided into 4 mandatory parts:
Diagnosis and analysis of emissions, carbon sequestration, final energy consumption in the area, energy production and the territory's vulnerability to climate change.
Territorial strategy: strategic and operational objectives in specific topics and their socio-economic consequences.
Action plan: definition of all actions, all stakeholders involved, resources required, the target audiences, the desired partnerships and the expected results for the main planned actions.
Monitoring and evaluation system: description of monitoring indicators and connection of indicators with those of the regional plans (mentioned below), public report on implementation after 3 years.
The PCAET must be revised every 6 years and currently, Grenoble Métropole, Nantes Métropole and Dijon Métropole are working on the revision of their PCAET.
The document is very close to the Climate City Contract from the Cities Mission, but there is no investment plan. It is the main difference between the two documents.

City climate plan
Many French cities have launched voluntary initiatives to define climate strategies within their own boundaries, but it is not mandatory contrary to the PCAET for metropolitan areas.
Paris climate plan 2024-2030
The 4th climate plan for Paris reaffirms the ambition of carbon neutrality, following targets of the Paris Agreement. The climate plan is a collective work with a public consultation (started at the end of 2022). City council has voted for the plan in December 2023 and it will be implemented at the end of 2024.
Lyon 2030 climate contract and climate, air and energy plan

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract
Page 182
Lyon 2030 is year initiative which aims to mobilise all actors of cities (citizens, economic actors...) in the ecological transition. It was built by year assembly called Agora Lyon 2030, gathering 65 organisations representing the diversity of actors in the region. The goal of Lyon 2030 is carbon neutrality in 2030. To complete this climate plan made by citizens, the city is committed with the local social action centre in a climate, air and energy plan. Lyon 2030 and the climate, air and energy plan was voted in 2023.

## Marseille

Marseille had a climate and energy plan from 2008 to 2020, with a revision in 2012. Currently, they do not have a climate plan and the Cities Mission is year opportunity to drive a dynamic concerning ecological transition.

**Territorial coherence plan (SCoT)**

The territorial coherence plan is a strategic urban planning document, which defines the spatial organisation and main development guidelines of the territory. The SCoT serves as a framework for sectoral policies, such as those focusing on spatial organisation and urban planning, housing, mobility, commercial development, the environment, including biodiversity, energy and climate. The territorial coherence plan must follow objectives from the SRADDET but it also influences other local plans such as PCAET, which has to consider the SCoT.

**Intercommunal local urban development plan (PLUI)**

The intercommunal local urban development plan is a local document for urban planning that sets out the rules for land use and development. The conditions for land use must respect the principles of sustainable development. The SCoT remains the major document concerning local urban planning, and the PLUI has to consider it.

## 5. Tools to support local authorities

**Contractualisation between State and territories: Contract for a successful ecological transition (CRTE)**

One of the tools for ecological planning is the contract for a successful ecological transition, which aims to implement the national plan in a given territory. Contracts for a successful ecological transition are a joint roadmap of actions to be carried out at inter-municipal or multi-municipal level to provide a crosscutting response to the challenges of territorial cohesion and ecological transition. This document is signed between the State (prefect) and a metropolitan area, and not with a city.

The aim is to facilitate understanding of existing strategies and plans by bringing them together into a single roadmap.

Each metropolitan area is free in the elaboration of the CRTE. There is no mandatory item. However, there are recommendations to help them drafting CRTE with the following elements:

Bringing knowledge about the territory with a territory project for instance
Defining strategic orientations
Building a multi-year action plan and describing the commitment of partners involved in the contract
Adding annual financial protocol

Projects from CRTE can be financed by the French recovery plan (called France relance), or French Green Fund, European funds, etc.

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract
Page 183
Financing tools for ecological transition

o Green fund

One of the tools of ecological planning is the Green Fund which was created in 2023 to support local authorities in their fight against climate change and the protection of biodiversity. The budget in 2023 was 2 billion euros and it is the same in 2024. The fund is guaranteed until 2027. The priority of the Green Fund is to finance ambitious projects concerning ecological transition. The green fund can finance projects from the contract for a successful ecological transition (see above). A third of the projects financed by the Green Fund were part of these contracts but only a quarter of the Green Fund budget is dedicated to contracts for a successful ecological transition. The fund is the main tool of the French Ministry of Ecological Transition to help territories and cities in their transition.

o Other tools

They are other tools and financial aid for ecological transition of territories in France. The National Agency for Territorial Coherence (ANCT) gathers on a website all the financial aid available for cities and local authorities.

The French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) offers financial aid to local authorities such as a heat fund, circular economy fund or France 2030 (recovery fund). The aim of this financial aid is to support the planning of the ecological transition of territories, supporting change, studies, implementation, investments, innovation and the sharing of solutions between territories.

The Bank for territories (Banque des territoires) has a lot of offers concerning ecological transition. The specificity of this bank is to be exclusively working with territories. They offer loans or engineering assistance and the EIB is financing partially the bank for territories.

All these tools are not enough to finance ecological transition of French cities.

Support in defining strategies and action plans

o Data and evaluation

The Regional Energy and Climate Observatories (OREC) are the local authorities' point of contact for local energy and climate data. Their role is to support local authorities in implementing their energy and climate strategies, by producing status indicators and dashboards at regional and inter-municipal levels. All regional observatories are part of the network of regional energy and environment agencies (RARE). The network has initiated a project with its members and partners to work on the convergence of OREC calculation methodologies, to have local energy and climate indicators that can be compared and added together at a national level. The project is financed by the Ministry of Ecological Transition, the Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) and Régions de France (year association gathering all French regions).

o Certification: Territory committed to ecological transition (TETE)

The French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) created a certification 'territory committed to ecological transition' (TETE). It is not a mandatory program but cities or metropolitan areas that are involved in the process have to build a four-year action plan. After the implementation of the action plan, the agency undertakes year evaluation and delivers the certification. Cities or metropolitan areas receive a score out of 5 (5 is the highest) based on the level of ecological transition. The

Nantes Métropole - Climate City Contract
Page 184
certification aims to highlight the evolution and the commitment towards ecological transition. The program can finance ecological transition experts and it helps in implementing the action plan.

Scores of French Mission Cities: Bordeaux (5), Nantes (5), Angers (4), Dijon (3), Dunkerque (5), Grenoble (4), Lyon (4), Marseille (1).

## EcoDistrict approach

The EcoDistrict approach created by the Ministry of Ecological Transition more than 10 years ago is year operational tool available to communities. Based on a consensus framework, it allows local authorities to implement actions in favor of the ecological transition and obtain the EcoDistrict label. Furthermore, this approach makes it easier for communities to obtain funding from the green fund.

# 1 Introduction

In 2023, 6 of the 9 planetary limits, defined as the Earth's habitability limits, were crossed. The climate crisis, the erosion of biodiversity, the depletion of resources, water and air pollution, the artificialization and sterilization of soils... are intrinsically linked and have the same origin: the pursuit of economic growth in a finite world. To resolve them, these crises need to be tackled together, in a global and systemic way.

Thus, the 2016 Paris Agreement set the achievement of global carbon neutrality by 2050 as a prerequisite for limiting temperature rise to  $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  by 2100. This implies a drastic and immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the search for carbon capture solutions for residual emissions.

The ambitious aim of the European mission "100 climate-neutral and intelligent cities by 2030" is to accelerate the momentum generated by the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal, by helping Mission Cities to go even faster than their national regulatory obligations and achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.

Nantes Métropole is proud to be part of this program. This commitment proves the real determination of the Metropole and its stakeholders to implement the necessary actions to tackle the climate crisis, to push their commitments even further and to take their share of responsibility.

The drafting of Nantes Métropole's Climate City Contract was an excellent opportunity to reaffirm the region's determination to tackle the climate and energy emergency, and to actively involve public and private sector partners. The aim was to move up a gear and implement as many actions as possible to achieve carbon neutrality as quickly as possible, while setting an example and paving the way for future cities embarking on this process.

For Nantes Métropole, the climate is part of a more global transition, taking into account the demographic, social, economic and technological transitions that intersect to achieve a fair, equitable and successful transition for all.

Through this approach, Nantes Métropole is asserting its role as a regional leader in the transition to a low-carbon economy, demonstrating its determination to transform climate challenges into sustainable opportunities, thanks to a thoughtful and concerted approach with partners who are experts in the field.

# The current situation

Nantes Métropole has experienced significant population growth, posing challenges in terms of housing and infrastructure, with a view to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030.
Rising temperatures and heat waves require decarbonization strategies for mitigation and adaptation.
Air quality has improved, but remains a concern due to emissions from transport and housing.
Heat waves are becoming more frequent and severe, impacting urban comfort and public health.

# A moral and regulatory commitment

Nantes Métropole goes beyond its simple legal obligations by affirming its moral commitment to helping achieve carbon neutrality on a global scale, in accordance with the Paris Agreements. The metropolis is explicitly committed to working towards the creation of a healthier, more pleasant and more equitable city, as defined by Net Zero Cities.

To give concrete expression to this commitment, Nantes Métropole has drawn up a SECAP (Sustainable Energy Climat Action Plan) that includes scope 3, thus going beyond mere regulatory requirements. This demonstrates a genuine desire for change and a willingness to go beyond national standards in the fight against climate change.

The metropolis has taken the initiative of working closely with elected representatives, metropolitan experts, local players and citizens by organizing working groups dedicated to the ecological transition. These working sessions are detailed in Part IV-Processes and organizational principles, as well as in the action plan. Nantes Métropole also works closely with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Pays de la Loire. This collaboration enables a more in-depth and scientific approach to reducing the carbon footprint of the region. The Pays de la Loire IPCC is also examining strategies for adapting to climate change, with the aim of improving the quality of life of the region's inhabitants and enhancing the region's resilience.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

In addition to aiming for a drastic and immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a massive increase in carbon sinks, the goal of carbon neutrality enables the region and its inhabitants to benefit from numerous co-benefits. These include, for example, improved air quality and better human and environmental health. The co-benefits of each proposed action will be detailed in the action plan.

GHG emissions within the Nantes Métropole perimeter represent only 40% of the emissions actually generated as a result of our responsibility (2,448 kteqCO2). The remaining 60% are "imported" emissions (or Scope 3) generated outside our territory, but directly linked to our activities and consumption (waste management, food, tourism, digital, goods and services, etc.).

Nantes Métropole's action plan therefore aims to target both the sectors that emit GHGs within the territory and to implement proactive measures to reduce the share of imported emissions.

Nantes Métropole's scope for action will therefore focus on:

Scope 1: direct GHG emissions, physically generated on the city's territory by local activity.

Nantes Métropole 2030 - City Climate Contract - Commitments - Page 6

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

O

Scope 2: indirect emissions, not physically produced on the territory, but associated with the consumption of electricity, heat and cold.
Scope 3: indirect emissions originating in the area, such as those linked to waste management. Nantes Métropole has also chosen to include part of Scope 3 in its action sheets, particularly in the areas of digital technology, tourism and food.

In drawing up the Contrat Ville Climat, Nantes Métropole is committed to taking its share of responsibility towards reducing the territory's GHG emissions by 80% compared to a situation where no environmental measures would be put in place by 2030 (business as usual).

Achieving this ambitious objective will not be possible through the actions of the metropolis alone, but through a convergence of ambitious, coherent and aligned commitments on the part of all players. Indeed, not all the sectors that emit the most greenhouse gases are covered by the metropolitan authority's competences, and even when they are, public policies alone cannot remove all the obstacles. No area depends solely on metropolitan public policy. Every action taken by the metropolis is "constrained" by the system in which it evolves, by lifestyle habits, by resistance to change, by the legislative context, by societal choices and so on. The various levers to be used are as much at metropolitan, regional, national and European level, and as much at institutional as private level. Nantes Métropole has opted for a high level of ambition, backed up by a discourse of truth, in order to make the case for what is at stake (levers and barriers detailed in section A.2-3: Description of systemic barriers and opportunities in the Action Plan).

# 3 Strategic priorities

The strategy of the Nantes metropolis, based on the Négawatt scenario, is part of a global approach to sustainability. This strategy aims to respond to energy and climate imperatives, while moving us towards a more sustainable, equitable and resilient society, by also addressing the issues of biodiversity, precariousness, air pollution, etc. The scenario is based on the winning trio: sobriety, efficiency, renewables.

## 1. Sobriety

(eliminating waste, containing urban sprawl, opting for alternatives to the car, reducing packaging, etc.) The issue of sobriety is taken into account on a metropolitan scale, whatever the scope.

## 2. Energy efficiency

(insulating buildings, improving the efficiency of electrical appliances or vehicles, etc.)

# 3. Favoring renewable energies for their low environmental impact and inexhaustibility

Sobriety is therefore at the heart of any energy-climate policy, which must first and foremost avoid energy consumption (sobriety), reduce it (efficiency) and then, as a last resort, consume renewable energies (renewables).

Ademe's Transitions 2050 report on scenarios for achieving carbon neutrality, published in November 2021, clearly illustrates the four different approaches: frugal generation, territorial cooperation, green technologies or restorative betting. These scenarios all convey a vision of tomorrow's world, and must be viewed through the prism of fairness here and elsewhere, and the impact on other ecological transition issues, notably biodiversity, health and natural resources (metals,...). They are all coherent, contrasting, difficult and risky, with different collateral impacts. The question arises of how to debate these different visions. Nantes' trajectory favors the principles of frugality (sobriety) and territorial cooperation. It's a real political choice, entirely supported by the metropolis.

It's about transforming our societies and organizations, and not just adjusting our models by optimizing them as much as possible. It's also a question of supporting changes in our models, with a profound evolution in our lifestyles and the associated imaginations. The challenges of ecological transition are therefore also cultural. In this respect, cultural, educational and support policies for associations and young people are levers to be activated.

The metropolis' political orientations and Ademe scenarios 1 and 2 advocate a preference for natural carbon sinks rather than technical carbon sinks (with the exception of bio-sourced materials). And this is indeed the choice made by the metropolis.

The year 2021 saw the establishment of a new strategic framework for the ecological transition in the Nantes metropolitan area, inspired by the national roadmap of the 2030 Agenda, the

French translation of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Schematically, it takes the form of a pentagon with 5 axes, used by the City of Nantes and Nantes Métropole, "to define and monitor the actions undertaken in terms of ecological transition":

carbon sobriety and adaptation to climate change
sustainable production and consumption patterns that save natural resources,
regaining biodiversity,
health-friendly environments,
safe, healthy and sustainable agriculture and food.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Given Nantes Métropole's high level of vulnerability to climate change, the city has set itself a number of key priorities in its carbon neutrality strategy. These key priorities were chosen on the basis of their weight in the current carbon footprint, and were then worked on in depth in the various working groups set up by the metropolis.

The proposed strategy must also enable us to achieve carbon neutrality, while building together a healthier, fairer, more sustainable and more resilient city (see part B - Trajectory towards carbon neutrality in 2030 of the Action Plan).

The breakdown of emissions by sector (figure below) highlights the fact that the sectors that emit the most greenhouse gases in Nantes Métropole are transportation and buildings.

Nantes Métropole's carbon footprint by sector, AURAN 2024

# Transportation

Transport is Nantes Métropole's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. In fact, it accounts for 44% of the territory's carbon footprint. As a result, it requires particular attention, both in terms of quantifying emissions and choosing priorities to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. It is for this reason that Nantes Métropole has chosen to focus on actions aimed at reducing the role of the car in the city and developing alternative modes of transport (e.g. combating car ownership, increasing the modal share of cycling and public transport). Nantes Métropole has observed several elements in connection with the transportation item:

The analysis of direct emissions (SCOPE 1) is not sufficient to take full account of the carbon footprint of electric vehicles or the issue of air travel, which account for 16% and 4% respectively of the total carbon footprint of a French person.
The widespread electrification of transport has become inevitable, driven by national and European policies. It offers an emission-free mobility solution in sparsely populated areas. However, its implementation is not entirely under the control of metropolitan policies and remains subject to uncertainties as to its practical realization. There is a risk associated with the ability to reach this technological level. What's more, vehicle electrification adds to the territory's imported emissions (Scope 3) and represents a threat to resources.
Mobility challenges focus on the impact of the car: space consumption, revegetation, and contribution to urban sprawl, among others. Achieving the objectives of the Plan de Déplacement Urbain (PDU) is not enough to align with a trajectory compatible with the national strategy for reducing carbon emissions. It is necessary to activate all available levers, including sobriety and behavioral changes, modal shift and technological advances.

Favoring active modes of transport in city centers and immediate suburbs, as well as carpooling in peri-urban areas, are emerging as favorable solutions, offering multiple benefits and no regrets.

## Buildings

Buildings (including residential and offices/equipment) are the second biggest contributor to the city's carbon footprint, accounting for 38% of total GHG emissions. Along with transport, this is one of Nantes Métropole's two priority sectors. Nantes Métropole has learned several lessons from its analysis of the carbon footprint of the building sector:

Social rental housing already benefits from high performance and substantial support (funds, technical governance, renovation methods). It is largely connected to the heating network, which predominates in multi-family housing, and therefore has relatively low emissions compared with private housing stock.

The private housing stock, particularly single-family homes, remains the main target for achieving carbon neutrality goals. These homes are often more spacious, and natural gas is more widely used. Annual renovations need to be multiplied by 1.5 to 2, focusing mainly on energy-intensive housing (classes E, F, G) and taking advantage of regulatory deadlines.

Promoting energy sobriety within private housing represents an effective and cost-effective lever. This approach could impact the 350,000 single-family homes and have a significant effect.

It's crucial not to overlook the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from refrigerant leaks from domestic cooling equipment. Although this is more of a regulatory issue at manufacturer level, it's important to raise awareness of the need to reduce the use of such equipment.

While 80% of the housing stock is already existing, energy renovation remains the main means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector.

## Societal innovations: with the integration of all stakeholders.

Nantes Métropole has set up in-depth, collective discussions as part of the renewal of the Territorial Climate Air Energy Plan and the drafting of the Climate City Contract. Various opportunities were created to foster collaboration between Nantes Métropole experts and those of partners such as associations, local authorities and businesses. Citizens have not been forgotten, notably through the Grands Débats (major debates) organized for several years within the metropolis. The aim of these debates is to include citizens in the city's major changes. In fact, Nantes Métropole has seized the opportunity offered by Net Zero Cities to work together in a systemic, holistic approach, to put an end to the siloed, compartmentalized work that was preventing the shared construction of concrete actions. Monthly meetings have been scheduled to promote this collaboration. These various meetings are detailed in Process and Calendar. These joint efforts have helped to ensure the coherence and robustness of the panel of action proposals presented in the report.

Nantes Métropole is also working closely with Université Gustave Eiffel on a public policy evaluation. Indeed, as a follow-up to the Climate Challenges set up under the Pilot Cities call for projects, Nantes Métropole wishes to monitor these Challenges, in particular to ascertain their impact on changing the behavior of local citizens. This evaluation has two objectives:

Evaluate the scheme (target audiences, results of actions initiated, communication, etc.), to support decisions on its continuation after its experimental phase financed by the European Union.
To capitalize on the lessons learnt from the approach on the obstacles and levers to behavioral change, in order to contribute to the metropolis' reflection on the evolution of lifestyles, in connection with its public policies contributing to the ecological transition marker. This evaluation does not directly aim to assess the replicability/transferability of the scheme to other European cities, but the lessons learnt from the evaluation may contribute to this reflection.

## Natural carbon sinks

The metropolis is well aware that it is necessary to work on carbon sinks to achieve climate neutrality. However, it does not wish to rely entirely on them, but rather to concentrate first on reducing the territory's greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and then to capture the residual. In addition, as described above, Nantes Métropole has chosen to focus on Ademe scenarios 1 and 2, which implies using only natural carbon sinks - with the exception of biosourced materials. The metropolis was able to observe several components:

Nantes Métropole 2030 - City Climate Contract - Commitments - Page 12

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

O

To achieve carbon neutrality objectives, it is necessary to significantly increase the capture capacity of the Nantes Métropole territory, rising from 32 to 340 kTeqCO2 by 2030, i.e. a 10-fold increase.
Currently, the carbon sinks present on the territory store around 15 million tonnes of carbon. It is crucial to ensure that the carbon stored in soils is not released excessively, either through human practices such as soil artificialisation, or by taking into account the impacts of climate disruption such as fires and drought.
Even with full mobilization of the territory, the 340 kTeqCO2 target seems difficult to achieve. The question of surface availability raises serious questions about the link between different public policies, particularly agricultural projects. Many actions concern the management of spaces and practices.
It is crucial to define a level of effort that is territorialized and planned over time, which raises the question of scale and cooperation between different territories.

The metropolis thus wishes to establish active collaboration between the various stakeholders to enable better management and conservation of the carbon sinks present in the territory. The question of collaboration with partners outside Nantes Métropole's territory is emerging as the solution for optimal storage and management of natural carbon sinks.

The investments needed to achieve carbon neutrality will come from a variety of sources, including both public and private players. This collaboration between the public and private sectors is essential to finance the vast projects required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that the financial co-benefits generated by this ecological transition will outweigh the associated costs. In other words, the savings made, the new economic opportunities created, and the gains in energy efficiency and public health will far outweigh the initial investments. This underlines not only the economic feasibility of carbon neutrality, but also the long-term economic benefits for society as a whole.

While aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 and working in depth on the areas mentioned above, Nantes Métropole will be paying very close attention to the following themes:

Preserving health ONE HEALTH
Improving quality of life and solidarity
Protecting resources

Nantes Métropole's internal organization - 2024

Mobilizing citizens is one of the fundamental pillars in achieving climate neutrality for Nantes Métropole, the aim being to drastically reduce the territory's emissions while creating the deep social bonds needed to transform society. The transformation of the metropolis is essentially based on social inclusion, which will be reinforced by a range of innovative schemes helping to create a participative ecosystem in transition. It is against this backdrop that Nantes Métropole has responded to Net Zero Cities' "30 Pilot Cities" Call for Projects and launched the Climate Challenges. These challenges offer a concrete opportunity to engage citizens in the ecological transition. From February 2024, Nantes Métropole is inviting citizens to contribute individually to this transition by proposing challenges that can be carried out at home via an application, as well as the possibility of establishing one's carbon

footprint. It is also possible to take part in collective challenges, notably by participating in group workshops. The aim of these initiatives is to raise citizens' awareness of climate issues and actively involve them in achieving carbon neutrality for Nantes Métropole.

Nantes Métropole is firmly committed to a proactive approach to sustainability and the fight against climate change. As part of this commitment, the city has chosen to work closely with the experts at Net Zero Cities. The partnership between Nantes Métropole and the experts at Net Zero Cities is of particular importance in the area of financing the transition to more environmentally-friendly practices. The crucial question of financing, often at the heart of sustainability issues, is thus being addressed in a proactive and concrete way. The aim is to establish clear and reliable financial mechanisms to ensure the effective implementation of the initiatives needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable lifestyles.

Ongoing discussions with Net Zero Cities experts aim to define robust financial strategies capable of fully supporting Nantes Métropole's transition to a more sustainable economy. In-depth discussions are underway to identify diversified and sustainable sources of financing, thus guaranteeing the sustainability of the actions undertaken as part of this ecological transition (action component).

The results of these discussions, and the conclusions drawn from this fruitful collaboration, will be recorded in the financing section of the Climate City Contract. This contract, as a formal instrument, will serve as a detailed operational framework, describing Nantes Métropole's specific commitments in terms of climate financing. It will thus become a reference document, setting out clear and detailed financial objectives, and spelling out the concrete measures that will be put in place to achieve the metropolis' climate ambitions.

In the interests of continuous improvement and monitoring the achievement of objectives, and provided that the Climate City Contract is an effective tool for steering the transition, the CCC will be updated by Nantes Métropole's Ecological Transition Department.

## A desire for transversality

Nantes Métropole is firmly positioned as a driving force for change and a forerunner of innovative solutions. With this in mind, the community aims to explore and address all related themes in a comprehensive way, so as to integrate them coherently into its transition process. With this global perspective in mind, the "ONE HEALTH" principle has been integrated into Nantes Métropole's organizational structure. This concept is based on a strategic reconfiguration of the metropolis' internal organization by merging the departments dedicated to health and ecological transition. This innovative approach aims to establish significant synergies between these two crucial areas, creating a collective

dynamic geared towards the development of a shared vision. The main aim of “ONE HEALTH” is to establish a true symbiosis between public health and ecological transition. By bringing these two pillars together, Nantes Métropole aims to establish a holistic approach, where health and the environment interact intrinsically. This cross-cutting vision transcends traditional public policy boundaries to create interconnectivity, enabling deep and comprehensive reflection on how health and ecological transition can mutually enrich each other. With this visionary initiative, Nantes Métropole is taking a forward-looking approach, demonstrating its willingness to rethink existing paradigms and place sustainability at the heart of its concerns. “ONE HEALTH” thus embodies the city's concrete commitment to a future in which the health of the population is inseparable from ecological balance.

# Iterative meetings

To create a solid, collective working approach, Nantes Metropole organized a series of iterative meetings between 2023 and 2024. These forums helped to forge links and generate ideas. The primary aim was to develop local institutional cooperation with the various partners (cf 2. Process for drawing up the City Climate Contract - p10 of the Action Plan).

# Summary of Nantes Métropole's working groups

Nantes Métropole's drive to achieve carbon neutrality is an illuminating example of the importance of engaging all stakeholders in the fight against climate change. By recognizing that this ambitious goal can only be achieved with the active participation and collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders, Nantes Métropole is demonstrating a visionary approach.

The establishment of new governance bodies reflects a desire to create structures that are adapted to the complexity of environmental and social issues. These bodies can serve as platforms where diverse knowledge, ideas and perspectives can be shared and integrated into the decision-making process. By fostering open and transparent dialogue, Nantes Métropole strives to create an environment conducive to innovation and cooperation. These innovations in governance will be described in greater detail in Part C of the action plan.

Similarly, the establishment of new working groups dedicated to the ecological transition demonstrates a willingness to tackle the specific challenges associated with this process. By bringing together experts, representatives of civil society, business and other stakeholders, these groups can provide a platform where different perspectives can be discussed and concrete solutions developed. This participatory and inclusive approach is essential to ensure that decisions are informed by a thorough understanding of local realities and the diverse needs of the community.

Ultimately, Nantes Métropole's approach illustrates the importance of community engagement and multi-sector collaboration in the fight against climate change. By adopting an inclusive and participatory approach, Nantes Métropole is leading the way towards a more sustainable and resilient future for all. These types of social innovations will be described in more detail in Part C of the Action Plan.

The crucial moments in the creation of the Climate City Contract are revealed through the submission of the bid in the call for expressions of interest in early 2022. This decisive act led to Nantes Métropole's selection as one of the winners in April 2022. The commitment then intensifies with planning for the submission of the final report, scheduled for September-October 2024, as well as the launch of the Pilot Cities project with Défis Climat in the first quarter of 2024. These key milestones underline the importance of Nantes Métropole's involvement in the development of the Climate City Contract, and mark crucial steps towards sustainable environmental goals.
