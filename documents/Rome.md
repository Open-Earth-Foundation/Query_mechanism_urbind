# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

The priority of Rome's commitment to climate is due to the crisis acceleration and the increasing devastating social and environmental consequences worldwide, as well as in the willingness to make the climate a transversal key for urban policy innovation to tackle the challenges that the city is called to face.

Participation in the EU Mission Climate neutral and smart cities represents a great opportunity to effectively programme choices in the direction of an ambitious city trajectory towards climate neutrality and make it a shared goal for all city actors.

The city's two key words in its ongoing climate work are vision and concreteness. Two new instruments defining the city's climate action priorities - the Climate City Contract, as far as mitigation is concerned, and the Roma Capitale Climate Adaptation Strategy - identify the actions already underway and those to be undertaken, as well as the barriers to be overcome and the opportunities that can be created. Hence, the most effective solutions to help families and businesses reduce their energy expenditure thanks to competitive and accessible alternatives for all citizens.

The aim is to transform Rome into an energy transition laboratory where, thanks to the projects spread throughout the city, the city meets the challenges of liveability, strengthening industrial innovation and local economy, reducing inequalities and improving urban regeneration, creating new cultural activities and opportunities for all.

Rome is a city where emissions are reducing. Analyses carried out as part of the SECAP pathway show a steady decline since the beginning of the new century, with a 35% drop compared to 2003 and an 11% drop to 2015, from 12.905 million in 2003 to 8.411 million tonnes of CO₂ in 2019. Per capita emissions stand at 2.9 tonnes CO₂eq in 2019, whereas they were 4.9 tonnes CO₂eq in 2003. The new methodology introduced by JRC for the Mission also asks cities to consider the additional sectors of AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) and IPPU (Industrial Processes and Product Use) and to use a slightly different emission factor. This brings the value of CO₂eq emissions in 2019 to 8.598 million tonnes, and per-capita emissions to 3.0 tonnes CO₂eq.

A gradual reduction in emissions has taken place in all sectors in recent years, with the percentage distribution between sources remaining essentially constant over the years, and almost 94% of emissions related to building and transport consumption.

The reduction in emissions achieved in recent years is largely explained by technological improvements. In particular, the renewal of the vehicle fleet has led to an improved efficiency of combustion processes, while in building heating, the gradual replacement of the most polluting boilers with more technologically advanced systems and the thermal insulation and energy efficiency of the building stock have reduced emissions. On the other hand, the increased use of renewable energy sources in the energy mix has had an effect on reducing emission factors related to electricity consumption. In addition, the switching of a large part of the lighting to LED lamps has reduced emissions from public lighting.

Roma Capitale seeks to contribute to the global climate commitment through strengthened collaboration with European and international cities to stop the climate crisis. In 2005, the

Municipality joined the C40 network of the world's large cities that agree on accelerating actions to stop climate change and, in 2009, the Covenant of Mayors. In 2013, it approved the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). That same year, it joined the '100 Resilient Cities' initiative and, in 2021, the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), which was last updated in the Climate Plan approved in 2023.

In 2023, Rome approved the update of the SECAP, as requested by the C40 Network to contribute to the global temperature containment target of 1.5 degrees. The 'Deadline 2020' programme has developed targets for different large cities around the world, with different goals depending on economic and geographic parameters. For Rome, the planned targets are higher than the reduction set by the SECAP in 2021. The new Plan, approved in November 2023 by the City Assembly, envisages a committed emission reduction target of -66% in 2030 compared to 2003, surpassing the -51.6% forecast in the plan approved in 2021.

The carbon neutrality target set by the '100 carbon-neutral and smart cities by 2030' Mission requires us to raise the level of ambition and create a coherent framework of urban policies with governance and long-term monitoring of results, based on a process of discussion and sharing with the city and stakeholder involvement.

The first choice to respond to this challenge was to create a new Climate Office, in the Mayor's Cabinet, with the task of coordinating the city's adaptation and mitigation policies. An internal working group within the administration, coordinated by the Climate Office, was created to ensure strong involvement and streamlining of all departments and councillorships whilst strengthening the scientific support of national research institutes and universities to the process.

The Climate City Contract is part of a path of urban policies that have had a strong acceleration towards climate neutrality in recent years, with a cross-sectoral vision covering the different sectors of the administration and which is in line with the instruments approved: Waste Plan, Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility, Climate Adaptation Strategy. These newly drafted instruments are one of the building blocks of the CCC and their implementation and results verification, updating of measures will be crucial for the work effectiveness and policy integration. In addition, the CCC drafting saw the involvement of the city's economic, social and institutional actors with respect to the ongoing and planned decarbonisation choices so that they could be integrated within a vision and share the work path for the coming years.

Rome's Climate City Contract has involved the city's economic and social actors with an Expression of Interest to collect their participation in the decarbonisation process and trace the framework of implemented and planned actions in the direction of climate mitigation and adaptation.

stakeholders participated in the Expression of Interest, submitting a total of 705 action sheets¹. The contribution of the urban ecosystem represents one of the building blocks for achieving climate neutrality: the decarbonization process concerns multiple aspects of the city organization and the activities present, and for its acceleration it is necessary to focus on some strategic choices that will affect the economic-industrial sector and people's lifestyles and habits in a transversal way. The strategies identified by the Administration, listed below, fall within sectors with a greater impact in terms

of CO₂eq emissions such as buildings and transport. More details will be provided in Part B of this document.

Main strategic choices of Roma Capitale:

Growth in production from renewable sources: this measure includes the installation of photovoltaic systems on civil buildings, parking lots and shelters; it also estimates the agrivoltaic potential in the municipal area.
Efficiency of buildings and electrification of thermal systems: the interventions concern the efficiency of envelopes, electrification of heating systems, implementation of energy consumption management systems, installation of renewable energy source systems for residential, social housing, industrial and tertiary sector buildings.
Integrated and zero-emission mobility: the strategy proposed in the CCC focuses on the electrification of the vehicle fleet in line with the principles defined by the PNIEC and the enhancement of smart working for all public and private employees.
Green energy: the estimate recognises partial coverage with green energy of total electricity consumption for the tertiary sector

As they will be presented in the following chapters, the strategies must be identified as part of an ambitious path that the Administration is committed to undertaking in the coming years: the estimates relating to the interventions will be validated over the years on the basis of the actual feedback that the Municipality will be able to collect during the process. The perspective for the future of climate goals focuses on the transversal involvement of social and economic actors: through the meetings, already started with stakeholders, the discussion on strategies and individual actions envisaged will be opened thanks to roundtables, follow-up events, seminars that will make it possible to verify the feasibility of the projects and welcome new proposals. The main elements that will guide the Administration are therefore expressed as follow:

Innovation in climate governance: the Administration wants to stimulate innovative forms of institutional governance by strengthening the relationship with European, national and regional institutions, with the Metropolitan City and municipal structures. Collaboration between structures and institutions and joint commitment to shared objectives are decisive factors for achieving climate neutrality targets. Work will be carried out on this point, reaffirming the central role of the Climate Office and the whole Transition Team in a co-designing and listening logic established at the beginning of the pathway to neutrality.
An inclusive transformation of the city that puts degraded neighbourhoods and buildings at the centre of the work, abandoned public spaces in which the focus is on the care and wellbeing of the people and communities who inhabit the places, starting with the most fragile segments of the population. An inclusive approach in which no one is left behind is the most effective way to build consensus on the energy transition, to make it understand its benefits not only environmentally but also in economic and social terms.
The integrated approach of climate policies: the transversal nature of the environmental issue emphasizes the need to cross-reference the mitigation policies put in place at different geographical levels (local, Regional, National, European) with the objectives of adaptation: the intertwining of the two issues is inextricable when intervening in neighbourhoods with forestation and adaptation interventions, on energy and infrastructure networks, and an integrated approach allows for more effective results.

The application of these principles in continuity with the modalities that led to the current edition of the CCC will ensure transparency and good results from the path towards neutrality to 2030 of the city.

# 2 Part A - Current Status of Climate Action

## 2.1 Module A-1 Baseline GHG emissions inventory

Since 2009, the Municipality of Roma Capitale, strongly convinced of the need to take part in the fight against climate change, had joined the European Covenant of Mayors Campaign. The Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) was drafted in 2013, providing an estimate of reference emissions as of 2003.

In June 2021, the Municipal Council approved the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) through Resolution no. 55 of the City Assembly and committed to reducing GHG emissions by 51.6% compared to 2003 levels. The emission inventory was regularly updated by means of subsequent monitoring, up to the latest version of 2019, drafted within the scope of the Roma Capitale Climate Plan (2023). With its commitment to the Climate Mission, Roma Capitale provides an updated framework of the city's decarbonisation path and defines the guidelines to achieve climate neutrality, in line with the commitments taken within the international C40 Cities (Climate Leadership Group) network that Rome has joined in 2005.

The emission baseline (ref. year 2019) was calculated using the methodology defined by Europe under the Covenant of Mayors and the CIRIS IT tool provided to the cities belonging to the C40 network. This choice was driven by a desire to follow NZC's lead without neglecting the effort made to date within the C40. The CIRIS allowed calculating the emissions for stationary energy and the waste sector.

The baseline inventory of the Climate City Contract (CCC) is a step forward in the process to quantify local emissions and it is based on the data collected upon the latest update of the SECAP emission inventory (ref. year 2019), as developed within the scope of Roma Capitale Climate Plan (2023). Some changes and integrations were made to the SECAP emission inventory to adapt the baseline inventory of the Climate City Contract with the calculation method provided in the documents developed by the Net Zero Cities.

The main changes between the SECAP 2019 emission balance and the Climate City Contract baseline for the same year are listed below:

**Electricity emission factor**: a different emission factor compared to the SECAP one was used to calculate the emissions related to electricity to also consider the contribution of GHG other than CO₂. Therefore, while the SECAP adopted the emission factor indicated by ISPRA² (CO₂), the CCC baseline calculation was carried out using the emission factor of the IPPC GHG approach in tCO₂eq. This technical assessment refers to the methodology drafted in 2006 by IPCC to create shared approaches for the estimation of GHG emissions. This results in different overall emissions, even though the starting point is the same final energy consumption.
**Additional emission sectors**: this integration is necessary as it is explicitly required under Mission 100 Carbon Neutral Cities. The additional sectors are:

Industry Processes and Product Use (IPPU) which includes GHG emissions deriving from industry processes and product use that produce emissions not

resulting from energy consumption. More specifically, emissions related to the concrete and lubricant sectors were estimated.

Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use - AFOLU, which calculates the emissions directly released in the atmosphere and not connected to final energy uses, related to the agriculture sector (i.e., manure management; use of fertilisers, spreading of slurry of livestock origin, etc.) and land use changes. More specifically, emissions related to breeding and land fertilisation. In addition, the ability of vegetation systems in the municipality, particularly forests and shrub lands, to store and accumulate carbon was quantified. Overall, the positive contribution related to absorptions can overcome emissions associated to the agriculture sector, hence the net contribution of the AFOLU sector would be negative. To maintain a cautious approach, the CCC emission inventory only accounted for GHG absorbed by vegetation systems able to generate full reduction of the emissions related to agriculture, this, the net contribution of the AFOLU sector in the CCC baseline inventory is null.

Below are the emissions divided according to the model provided by the NZC which specifies the sector in the rows and the reference energy vector in the columns, divided into three Scopes, where 'Scope 1' refers to emissions generated by combustion processes or climate-altering gas emissions emitted within the boundaries of the system under analysis (in our case within the municipal boundaries). 'Scope 2' refers to emissions generated by energy consumption distributed through networks (e.g. electricity and district heating), where the generation process of the energy consumed takes place outside the system boundaries (e.g. thermoelectric power plant producing electricity), while for 'Scope 3' refers to emissions generated outside the municipal boundaries but linked to processes that take place in the municipality (e.g. production of waste/wastewater produced within the municipality that is destined for waste-to-energy/treatment located in another municipality).

Overall, the Buildings sector shows a relevant emission value, resulting in a percentage (60%) higher than the overall value obtained by combining Transport (34%), Waste (5%) and IPPU (0.5%). The AFOLU sector, which includes agriculture and livestock farming activities, is equal to approximately 1% of emissions, fully balanced by the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  intake or absorption by municipal vegetation systems.

To provide a clear picture of the emission contributions across the various sectors, the graph shown was made by excluding  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  absorption by vegetation.

Figure 3: Emissions 2019 divided by sub-sectors, in percentage

The graph above provides additional details to Figure 2. The 'Buildings' sector is divided into emission subsectors: residential, tertiary, industry, agriculture and municipal buildings and equipment. In this case, the third sector also includes municipal buildings, and the industry sector include agriculture. Analogously, the 'Transport' sector is divided into the road, air (aviation) and rail transport sub-sectors.

A scenario emerges in which the final energy consumption ('Natural gas and Electrical Energy') of the residential and tertiary sub-sectors is responsible for more than  $50\%$  of total emissions. The single most relevant sector, however, is 'Road Transport', which accounts for about  $33\%$  of emissions.

Figure 4: Emissions by energy vectors/emitting gases

The chart in Figure 4 shows that electrical energy is the most significant emitting vector in the context of city greenhouse gases, followed by natural gas. From the Pareto curve, shown in the graph, it is easy to deduce that the two energy vectors mentioned above give rise to about  $80\%$  of the total emission.

# A-1.6: Description and analysis of baseline inventory and GHG emissions

The CCC baseline of Rome as of 2019 was: quantified in 8,598,003 tCO $_2$ eq.

The general picture shows most of the emissions under Scope 1, directly generated within the Municipal area. Scope 2 includes most of the remaining emissions, and it only includes the final uses of electric energy. Finally, Scope 3 includes emissions related to waste treatment, currently carried out outside of the Rome territory. More specifically, such emissions are generated by composting, incineration and land filling. As far as the division by sector is concerned, most of the emissions (approximately 5,184,229 tCO $_2$ eq) is included in the 'BUILDINGS' category, which corresponds to the Stationary Energy sector. In the 'BUILDINGS' sector, most of the emissions are ascribable to the housing and tertiary sub-sectors. In addition to that, the 'TRANSPORT' sector accounts for 2,929,845 tCO $_2$ eq, equal to about  $34\%$  of total emissions. The 'WASTE' sector generates emissions for a total of about 438,272 tCO $_2$ eq, of which the majority falls under Scope 3, as it is produced outside the municipal boundaries. The IPPU and AFOLU sectors remain residual. In addition, as far as the 'AFOLU' sector is concerned, the absorption of CO $_2$  by the vegetation systems present in the municipal territory exceeds the emissions attributable to the same sector; to keep a prudential approach, it was decided to treat the total emissions pertaining to this sector as equal to zero. In the table below, the percentages are calculated considering, as far as the AFOLU sector is concerned, only the emission contributions. The last row shows the contribution, in tonnes of CO $_2$  absorbed, of the vegetation systems in the municipal area, which is necessary to fully abate the emission contribution of the AFOLU sector.

As far as energy end-use is concerned, the consumption data in MWh contained in the 2019 emissions inventory template prepared within the SECAP were used; however, some modifications had to be made for the construction of the CCC baseline to fulfil the methodological indications contained in the 'Info kit for Cities' guideline.

Below are the differences between the SECAP and the CCC baseline:

For electricity consumption, the national emission factor as of 2021 of  $0.284\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{eq} / \mathrm{MWh}$  was used (source National and European Emission Factors for Electricity Consumption NEEFE, jrc-com-neefe_1990-2021); in the SECAP, on the other hand, the emission factor used is  $0.269\mathrm{tCO}_2 / \mathrm{MWh}$ , as indicated by ISPRA (Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale) in the document 'Efficiency and decarbonisation indicators in Italy and in the biggest European Countries' of 2023.
As indicated in the introduction, the contributions of the IPPU and AFOLU sectors that were not included in the SECAP baseline were calculated.

Details on the calculation methodology used for the two sectors added to the CCC and the differences with the SECAP calculation, namely IPPU and AFOLU; are provided below.

# IPPU

As far as the IPPU sector is concerned, the estimate was made starting from the 2019 GHG emissions of the Metropolitan City of Rome published by ISPRA. ISPRA quantifies emissions across the following industries:

Cement (decarbonation)
Rolling mills
Lubricants
Use of lime and dolomite

As far as the territory of the Metropolitan City of Rome is concerned, the total amounts to about 593,000 tCO $_2$ eq.

For the estimation of IPPU emissions in the Rome municipal territory, the electricity consumption of the various industrial sectors was used as a proxy. These data were obtained from Terna (for the Metropolitan City of Rome) and ACEA (for Rome). Based on this methodology, the total emissions of the IPPU sector for Rome amount to about 45,700 tCO $_2$ eq, mainly concentrated in the cement and lubricants sectors. The table below summarises emissions by sector and specific proxy.

Table 2: IPPU: Emissions values divided by sectors

# AFOLU

The emission inventory of Rome also includes the emitting contribution of the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use Sector. More specifically, inputs related to livestock farming, agricultural activities and carbon stock changes were assessed.

# EMISSIONS

As for livestock activities, the emissions connected to enteric fermentation (methane) and manure management (methane and nitrous oxide) were considered.

The data related to the number of livestock units existing in the municipality of Rome were taken from the National Livestock Register, which provided the exact number of cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, horses, mules and donkeys and poultry in the municipality. The estimate of emissions was made using the methodology defined in the IPCC 'Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories' of 2006, adding, where applicable, the national emission factors as of 2019 calculated by ISPRA in the National Inventory Report 2021.

As far as agricultural activities are concerned, the emissions connected to the use of nitrogen fertilising compounds for soil cultivation were considered. Such emissions are directly connected to anthropogenic nitrogen inputs, but also to the contribution associated with the volatilisation of nitrogen compounds in the form of  $\mathrm{NH}_4$  or  $\mathrm{NO}_x$ , which, once redeposited on the ground, can be a further source of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ . Also in this case, the methodology used was taken from the IPCC Guidelines above. The estimation of nitrogen additives to soils, however, was carried out by repartitioning regional ISTAT data (cultivated agricultural areas and quantities of nutrients contained in fertilisers per hectare of fertilisable area) at the municipal level.

# ABSORPTION

The municipal territory of Rome, the largest in Italy, has a variety of landscapes characterised, both in the hills and valleys around the city, and in the coastal strip, by extensive woods and permanent grasslands.
ROMA

Climate Neutrality

Action Plan

#

To estimate the annual carbon stock variation, the first step was to obtain the data on the extension of the vegetation systems in the municipality of Rome, reported in the document "Rome's vegetation report": this document identifies and quantifies the areas of woodland, dividing between broad-leaved and coniferous trees, and those of shrub land, for a total of 24,803 ha. As regards the surface area in hectares of permanent grassland, the area occupied was instead taken from the report 'L'uso e il consumo di suolo di Roma Capitale - Land Use and Consumption of Roma Capitale (Rapport 2021)'.

The Vegetation Report identifies, within the forest and shrubland macro-systems, the areas with a prevalence of one or more plant species, such as: woods with a prevalence of holm oak, cork oak, turkey oak, maple, etc. Average carbon storage values per hectare (i.e. an average carbon dioxide absorption per hectare in  $\mathrm{tCO_2}$ ) were applied to these surface extensions, subdivided by type of prevalent plant species, based on estimates from an analysis conducted by the University of Parma. The results obtained correspond to an estimate of the total annual absorption of climate-altering gases by the forests and shrub lands of Rome. However, a prudential scenario was chosen, obtained by reducing the above results by  $50\%$ , considering environmental and human variables that may affect the development of plant biomass. As for the change in the carbon stock of permanent grassland, the estimated annual  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  uptake value extracted from the same analysis conducted by the University of Parma was applied directly.

The total annual absorption of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  by the extra-urban vegetation systems of Rome territory amounted to over 273,000 tCO $_2$ .

|  Extra-urban forests | Surface (hectares) | Intake tonCO2/y  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Woods (Broad-leaved and conifers) | 15,953 | 247,393  |
|  Shrubs | 2,195 | 13,884  |
|  Permanent herbaceous | 6,656 | 11,980  |
|  Total | 24,803 | 273,257  |

As for public trees, mainly found in parks, streets and schools, the number of trees, split based on size into large, medium and small, was obtained from the document 'Strategic Guidelines on Urban Green in Rome'. As absorption coefficients per tree (in  $\mathrm{tCO_2}$ ), the values reported in the document 'Guidelines for the Region of Tuscany' were used, which reports average absorption data for each plant species. Using these values, average absorption coefficients were calculated for each macro set (large, medium, small trees), considering the main plant species in the city. The annual absorption of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  by the public tree stock of Rome was found to be around 15,000  $\mathrm{tCO_2}$ .

Table 3: Surface and  ${\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2}$  absorption of extra-urban forestry

|  Public trees (parks, roads and schools) | Number of trees | Intake tonCO2/y  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Large trees | 181,884 | 12,381  |
|  Medium trees | 83,604 | 2,345  |
|  Small trees | 66,995 | 221  |
|  Total | 332,483 | 14,946  |

The above results show how the emission contribution linked to livestock farming and nitrogen applied to soils in agriculture is lower than the absorption of the vegetation systems present in the municipal territory, and therefore the AFOLU would be a sector that reduces the stock of climate-altering gases emitted.

As mentioned above, to maintain a prudential approach, the amount of GHG absorbed was assumed to be precisely the value required to fully offset the emissions pertaining to the sector (101,007 tCO₂).

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Module A-2 Analysis of existing policies and strategies

Before delving into the description of the strategic plans and policies for environmental sustainability and climate, a premise is a must: the Climate City Contract of Rome is part of a process that has seen a strong acceleration towards climate neutrality following the publication of the following strategic plans: the Climate Plan, the Waste Plan, the Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility, and the Climate Adaptation Strategy. As these plans have been recently drafted/updated and approved (e.g. the City Council's approval of the Climate Plan in September 2023), and are often carried out alongside the work on the Climate City Contract, it is important to consider the named plans as key elements of a strategic vision into which the CCC fits for specific insights in terms of additional strategies, enlargement of the urban ecosystem (with further involvement and enlargement of the stakeholder base), specific analyses of costs and investments needed for the climate.

Said Plans and related policies and actions must therefore be considered as an integral part of the CCC Action Plan, after obviously excluding the risk of double counting of actions. In module B, special attention will be paid to the overall contribution of the existing plans in terms of reducing climate-changing emissions.

In detail, while the Climate Plan reaches an emission reduction percentage of -66%, the CCC achieves neutrality by 2030. Moreover, the Climate Plan explicitly mandates the in-depth economic and financial analysis of neutrality actions to the CCC. The Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility focuses on tangible actions directly related to reducing emissions from the transport sector, concentrating mainly on large infrastructure interventions in the public sector. The CCC, again preventing double accounts of actions, broadens the range of mobility actors and makes public actors, such as Roma Capitale and its co-partnership, focus on behavioural and strategic actions for sustainable mobility. Similarly, there is synergy between the Waste Plan and the CCC. In conclusion, the Climate Adaptation Strategy complements the CCC on climate change adaptation, a topic usually not included in the CCCs of the Mission Cities.

The following is an overview of the chronological pathway that the city has pursued up to the drafting of this document, highlighting the main plans and giving an overall picture in which the City's interventions, strategies and corresponding co-participation on individual initiatives are evident. Table A-2.1 summarises the main contents selected at national, regional and local level.

Figure 5: Timeline and pathway of Roma Capitale toward climate neutrality

# The Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) and the transition to the SECAP

Roma Capitale's commitment started with joining the Covenant of Mayors by resolution no. 51 of 18/06/2009 by the Municipal Council, followed by resolution no. 10 of 7/3/2013, which led the City Assembly to approve the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). This Plan included a series of actions to achieve the goals of the Covenant of Mayors, to which the city was committed up to 2020.

In 2017, the City Assembly approved resolution no. 78 of 14/11/2017 to join the new Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, a new challenge launched by the European Commission on 15 October 2015, which introduced the European objectives for 2030 and presented an integrated approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Considering the above, with Resolution no. 55 of 8 June 2021, Rome's City Council approved the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), its mitigation and adaptation strategies, and committed to reducing GHG emission by  $-51.6\%$  compared to 2003 levels.

Resolution of the City Assembly no. 174 of 14 November 2023 approved the update to the goals of the preceding SECAP through a new document called 'Climate Plan', drafted in concert with the members of the C40 Network, of which Rome is a member. This document effectively prevails over the SECAP, abandoning its original structure and devoting more space to strategies and future scenarios. In line with the C40 deadline, the goal is to contain the global temperature increase below  $1.5\mathrm{C}^{\circ}$  by 2030.

# The City Statute of Roma Capitale

Approved for the first time in 2013, the City Statute of Roma Capitale is also in line with the objectives of the Covenant of Mayors, confirming the city's commitment to climate neutrality. Article 2 of the statute contains policy guidelines consistent with the objectives of the Climate Mission:

promote the economic, social and cultural development of the city;
ROMA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

direct urban planning choices towards the redevelopment of the urban fabric, safeguarding the landscape, the natural characteristics of the territory, and the public need for enough parks, gardens and green spaces.

The Statute is the fundamental charter of a municipality and regulates its general organisation within the principles established by law, such as the functioning of government bodies, citizen participation in political and administrative activity, the management of municipal public services, and collaboration with other bodies. Integrating climate objectives into this document is an important step that the city wanted to take to achieve climate neutrality and to involve its organs in an all-encompassing manner.

# The 2021-2026 Policy Guidelines and the Ufficio di Scopo Clima (Climate Office)

The 2021-2026 policy guidelines for the government of Roma Capitale, approved by the City Assembly with Resolution no. 106 of November 2021, reaffirm the objectives to be pursued for the five-year period of the new administrative mandate, including the commitment to a policy of enhancing the city's sustainable development in its territory, in line with the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda and the European Energy and Climate Plan.

Also in 2021, the resolution of the City Council no. 306 of December 2021 established, within the Cabinet of the Mayor, the 'Climate Office' with specific tasks concerning the coordination of actions to fight climate change. The Office's main role in the transition to decarbonisation is that of 'Change Agent' (thus recognising it as one of the three roles indicated by NZC as relevant in the Transition Team), i.e. the local entity that leads the change. A detailed description of the Climate Office can be found in Form C.

# The Climate Plan and the C40 network membership

Roma Capitale has been a member of the C40 network since its establishment in 2005. C40 is a global network of large cities working to develop and implement policies and programmes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, damage and environmental risks caused by climate change, established under the Global Covenant of Mayors. As one of the network's partners, Rome committed to developing a series of actions towards climate neutrality by 2050, through the adoption of a strategic plan engaging every sector of the administration. Together with several other world and European capitals, the city of Rome is a signatory of two commitment agreements:

Green &amp; Healthy Streets Accelerator: a commitment to placing citizens at the centre of urban planning and transforming spaces in a greener and healthier perspective for the entire city population. Boosting infrastructures to facilitate intra-citizen movement by bike, on foot or public transport can reduce the number of vehicles in the city, and in particular high-emission polluting vehicles. The outcomes of these objectives will be the subject of a biennial report in which the city of Rome will play a leading role together with the other signatories to enable the monitoring of the activities introduced.
Urban Nature Accelerator: cultivating and caring for urban nature creates opportunities for healthy and sustainable livelihoods, especially as cities increase their resilience to climate change. This includes improved physical and mental health and access to better employment and economic outcomes. To this end, the city of Rome commits to implement, within five years from the signing of the agreement, a strategy to develop green spaces in the city, draw up a baseline inventory of natural vegetation and conduct an accounting of green areas to raise awareness of the added value of urban natural spaces and, in addition, upgrade adaptation actions reflecting the ambitious environmental objectives.

Furthermore, as mentioned above, as a C40 member, in 2023, Rome approved the Climate Plan based on the C40 model and objectives.

# Participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project

In 2023, Roma Capitale handed in its fifth annual assessment to the CDP - Carbon Disclosure Project to measure and manage the city's climate change information scoring a  $\mathsf{B}^3$ . The CDP offers a system to measure, track, manage and share climate change information globally: each year, a questionnaire is collected that contains a set of information that participants (businesses, cities and government bodies) are required to provide to feed a vast platform accessible to all members. It aims to provide information and share it among different actors to increase the transparency of undertakings and bodies with respect to their environmental impact and help public administrations develop models of adaptation to climate change by fostering the dissemination of best practices in urban areas. Using the CDP assessment methodology, the analysis led to an encouraging outcome since, according to the organisation, the administration 'understands the main local risks and impacts of climate change. Moreover, it has plans and actions in place to adapt and/or reduce these effects.' In particular, the score achieved on adaptation actions shows that the city 'has assessed the impacts and risks of climate change, it has implemented an adaptation plan and is taking measures to adjust to the effects of climate change'. As for mitigation actions, instead, the Administration 'has an inventory of emissions, has implemented a mitigation plan, has set a target and is taking measures to reduce emissions.'

Figure 6: Score of the Carbon Disclosure Project

# Roma Capitale Climate Adaptation Strategy

Special emphasis should also be made on the Climate Adaptation Strategy of Roma Capitale: Rome is the first Italian city to have adopted a real climate adaptation strategy to secure the territory from the impacts expected by 2050 with actions to be implemented already by 2030. Fighting the climate emergency passes through two main objectives: that of 'mitigation', to reduce emissions, and that of 'adaptation' to the impacts already underway.

The Strategy approval by the City Council took place on 23 January 2024, followed by the public consultation phase and moments of confrontation and training with the territory through conferences, thematic workshops and working tables with stakeholders and competent institutions (Ministry of the Environment, Regional Authorities and Metropolitan City) $^{4}$ .

The decision to draw up the city's first Adaptation Strategy was prompted by the need for a clear and coherent framework of measures to be taken, which would make it possible to respond to the vulnerabilities highlighted, but also to deepen the analyses to address more complex areas. The Strategy is the most effective tool to govern a process, such as that of climate adaptation, which inevitably sees articulated responsibilities and competences. This document aims at setting up a path to share risks, objectives and intervention priorities for an effective institutional cooperation and for achieving results that depend on the effectiveness of the regulatory framework, the certainty of funding,
ROMA

the clarity of competences, plans, programmes, and interventions carried out by different Authorities. Climate adaptation in Rome is a process that will undergo periodic reviews and adjustments to respond to the priorities identified in the strategy⁵.

The Plan has the following objectives:

Reducing risks to people's health and safety
Rethinking the city's relationship with water and the sea
Reducing heat in neighbourhoods,
Improving liveability starting with the most fragile neighbourhoods
An economy resilient to climate impacts

The main criticalities to deal with are:

increased intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall and flooding, with impacts on infrastructure and urban spaces, increased risk of river flooding.
the availability of water supplies, against a backdrop of longer drought periods, leading to an acceleration of measures to save, reduce losses, reuse.
the rise in temperatures and heat waves, in a city already experiencing increasing heat and with neighbourhoods suffering from a worrying urban heat island effect.
the escalation of impacts on the shoreline, from coastal erosion processes to storm surges and tornadoes, in a scenario of sea level rise.

Following the consultation, the administration published a summary document with details, images and links of the 7 public events held as conferences and workshops between February and May 2024. Throughout the consultation phase, people and stakeholders were given the opportunity to send in written comments regarding the issues and aspects to improve the work. Commitment to continue the discussion on these issues is a priority of the administration, which will be carried on in articulated and different forms also in the subsequent phases of the Strategy for the implementation of the measures, in-depth study of the issues and articulation of analyses and scenarios. Further details on the consultation will be provided in Module C.

## Selection for the 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030

Finally, as part of this process, the city was short-listed by the European Commission in 2022 as one of the '100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030' within the 'Horizon Europe' programme. With this strategy, the European Union wants to accelerate towards the 'European Green Deal' through cross-sectoral projects that target smart and sustainable cities capable of achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

## Memoranda of understanding and working tables

Also, relevant as important levers for change are the memoranda of understanding drawn up by Roma Capitale for multi-level governance with various bodies and institutions in the territory. While leaving the in-depth analysis to Module C of this document, these have been included in the table below.

|  SECAP - Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan | The Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) is a document drafted by the municipalities subscribing to the new Covenant of Mayors which demonstrates how the municipal administration intends to achieve its CO2 mitigation targets (in this case -55% by 2030) and increase its resilience to climate change. The addition of the adaptation part makes the new plan the evolution of the SEAP. | The Municipality of Rome adhered to the New Covenant of Mayors with Resolution of the City Assembly no. 78 of 14/11/2017, with which the previous SEAP was also revoked. Subsequently, in 2021, the SECAP was approved (Resolution of the City Assembly no. 55 8/06/2021).  |
|  Rome Climate Plan 2023 | Update of the SECAP to the GHG emission reduction scenario necessary to contain the global temperature increase within 1.5 °C, in line with the C40 'Deadline 2020'; it also increases the commitment to reduce emissions to - 66% compared to 2003, or - 54.1% compared to 2015. | This plan confirms and deepens the SECAP actions approved in 2021, the choices made in the current Plans in the various sectors (PUMS and Waste Plan), and the new actions that accelerate decarbonisation thanks to the NRRP resources, Jubilee funds, European, national and regional funding, and the administration's budget. Work on targets and actions will continue within the European Mission and will lead to the approval of the Climate City Contract in 2024. To accelerate and coordinate the decarbonisation process, the Municipality of Rome has created a new Climate Office in the Mayor's Cabinet.  |

|  Roma Smart City Plan | Roma Smart City Plan stems from a shared path with the Roma Capitale Smart City Laboratory: the latter is a body composed of all those interested (multistakeholders) in co-designing the future of Rome. The Roma Capitale Smart City Laboratory operates with a multidisciplinary approach that brings together the Municipal Administration together with citizens, associations, businesses, universities, and research centres to support the plan's implementation and the elaboration of future projects. | The Roma Smart City plan is a dynamic planning tool and therefore requires annual updating with particular reference to the indicators and projects it contains. Updating and monitoring the plan falls within the competence of the governance bodies, which are also expected to give organicity and systematicity to all initiatives, implementing the guidelines and coordinating the management of the Plan. In addition, the aforementioned bodies (Smart City Council and Smart City Steering Committee) will be set up to start the activities to identify the members of the Technical-Scientific Committee that will work in close contact with those responsible for the Plan's development. Lastly, to disseminate the contents of the Plan more effectively, one or more online sections are foreseen that make the contents more accessible and consultable by citizens. A dedicated page could be created for the most relevant initiatives to increase the availability of information and data sharing for the benefit of the community.  |
|  GRP - General Regulatory Plan | The General Regulatory Plan of Roma Capitale is the most important urban planning instrument that regulates building activity within the municipal territory. | The Plan provides indications and suggestions for the planning and evaluation of interventions for the city's 20 municipalities. Given the uniqueness of the city's heritage, the GRP also contains the Charter for Quality, which provides precise evidence of Rome's urban landscape, public spaces and archaeological assets to ensure that the transformations taking place in the city are consistent with the pre-existing heritage.  |
|  Roma Capitale Waste Management Plan | The Plan for the Integrated Waste Management and Clean-up of Roma Capitale, approved at the end of 2022, is part of the framework outlined by the government decree that nominated the Mayor of Rome as Special Commissioner for waste and is in line with the national and European strategy for circular economy and sustainable development and the goals of the Climate Neutrality Mission. | The plan therefore intends to guarantee the Capital self-sufficiency in the management of the integrated waste cycle and a leading role in the circular economy and sustainable development. The new integrated plant system, the adoption of the most advanced emission abatement systems, and the massive reduction of landfill disposal will all contribute to the achievement of the Italian and European objectives for 2035. In particular, the goal is to increase the waste sorting rate from 45.2 % today to 65 % in 2030 and to 70 % in 2035. The scenario described in the Plan will lead to a reduction of about 90% in CO2 emissions compared to the waste sorting scenario at 65% but with the plant situation unchanged. Rome's contribution to the path to climate neutrality will come from the recovery of energy from residual waste, the substantial decrease in climate-changing gas emissions, and the closure of landfills. The optimisation of transport will also be fundamental, by cutting long distances to plants located outside the region and abroad.  |
|  Regulation for the provision of areas and solar photovoltaic systems of Roma Capitale in favour of solidarity-based renewable energy communities. Date of | These Regulations relate to the provision of areas or installations for the production of energy from renewable sources owned by Roma Capitale or the Municipalities in favour of Solidarity-based Renewable Energy Communities (CERS), that are not used directly for institutional and instrumental activities and are not intended to be exploited. | Roma Capitale will be responsible for the drafting and approval of models and forms relating to the procedures set forth in the regulation, including: RECs Public Notice or Application for Participation; RECs Project Proposal; RECs Substitute Declarations; Outline of Agreement.  |

# 2.3 Module A-3 System Barriers and Opportunities for Climate Neutrality

## A-3.1: Description of Systemic Barriers and Opportunities

An analysis of the barriers and opportunities for climate neutrality in Rome was recently carried out during the drafting of the Climate Plan. The main results are reported below, adding further details from both Roma Capitale's internal meetings and those held with external stakeholders.

The achievement of the CCC objectives requires significant investments in the sectors involved, with different relevance and features according to the parties involved (public or private), the technologies and incentives available, which allow a return on investments with different timelines through management savings. Some of the initiatives will need direct State and European non-repayable funds for public interventions, or through incentives to private individuals, while others will already be competitive without incentives but will require instruments to access credit for investments.

## Renewable resource energy

The distribution of photovoltaic plants in the territory has gone from 13,007 plants installed at the end of 2019⁶, the year of the baseline inventory, to 21,846 in December 2023 (GSE data). Despite the considerable growth in recent years, also shown by the data described above, the potential for the installation of photovoltaic systems in the municipal area, especially on buildings, is still significant.

For the installation of solar power on the roofs of buildings in Rome, on the shelters of the largest car parks and for a share of agrivoltaic plants according to the maximum potential covered by the study carried out for the Climate City Contract, the total estimated investment is about 5.5 billion euros (Ref. Investment Plan).

The incentive system currently in force allows investments by households and businesses to be financed up to 50%, through tax deductions, and provides incentives for energy communities and collective self-consumption configurations in line with the European Directive 2018/2001.

Additionally, the **barriers** to RES plant development concern low-income households, which cannot benefit from incentives due to the absence of income to be deducted, and more generally in the access to credit, which finds issues compared to the guarantees required for investments in the direction of decarbonisation. Large-scale agrivoltaic and photovoltaic plants to cover parking lots, on the other hand, are now in a grid parity in terms of price-production, so most frequent barriers they face are related to authorizations and access to credit.

To make the 2030 objectives concrete, it is important to give continuity and effectiveness to incentives, simplify procedures, solve issues for ineligible families and introduce a fund for access to credit at subsidized rates for this type of intervention.

The knowledge of the photovoltaic potential, both in terms of kWp and related to the most suitable places for installations, is a great opportunity for greater development of this renewable source in the territory.

RES installation is associated with the development of the CACER (called CERC – Capitoline Renewable Energy Communities in Rome) which put in place the first concrete steps just as this plan was being written. The development of Renewable Energy Communities is an effective solution to reduce energy poverty and fight inequalities, and a concrete response to the energy prices' fluctuations which imply higher bills.

Authorization barriers are also an issue face by the Capitoline Municipality. The installation procedures are often complex due to the national superintendence which defines limitations and to the legislation on suitable areas which presents strong critical issues for the development of photovoltaics and agrivoltaics systems. The Municipality will simplify the procedures for installing solar panels on the roofs of buildings, as required by Resolution No. 402 approved in December 2022, implementing a national law approved in 2022, in order to reduce one of the main barriers to access in a city where there is a widespread stratification of limitations.

Strong opportunities are given by new technologies (e.g. vertical and/or chromatic panels) and by the increasing development of innovative projects. An example of this is the San Giovanni Addolorata hospital in Rome with its flagship project, also presented on various national working tables, for the installation of a photovoltaic system located on buildings subject to specific limitations.

# Energy efficiency of the private building stock

The planned energy requalification objectives for the building stock - private residential buildings, public social housing blocks, tertiary and industrial buildings, and public buildings - can be estimated at a total expenditure of about EUR 19.17 billion, which concern efficiency upgrades on the building envelope, the reduction of transmittances, and the efficiency/electrification of thermal systems; as far as the tertiary and industrial sectors are concerned, the interventions envisage the reduction of methane, fuel oil and diesel oil consumption in the sector through interventions on the building envelope, systems, and the electrification of overall consumption.

Barriers to the speeding up of interventions are to be found in the incentive systems in force, currently being reviewed by the government, which cover a share of the investment for private interventions but do not reward separately the performance achieved in terms of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  and are inaccessible to low-income households (the individuals with insufficient earnings or those who have no income to declare). As with photovoltaics, households and companies face problems in accessing credit for financing this type of intervention.

As regards the assets of Roma Capitale, it can be estimated that more than half of the buildings (starting with schools, offices, social housing) could be upgraded with the incentive systems in force (including the thermal account, which covers  $65\%$  of the expenditure of efficiency-enhancing interventions) and through public-private partnerships for upgrading and management through tenders and Energy Performance Contracts. For the remainder, the structures' static and decay problems are such that state resources are needed to enable the interventions. A system of access to credit at subsidised rates must also be introduced for the financing of energy efficiency measures. To realise the 2030 targets, it is necessary to introduce, within the framework of the National Plan for the Renovation of Buildings, provided for by the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), a system of incentives that transparently and progressively rewards the reduction of emissions over a multi-year horizon, and a fund for access to credit at subsidised rates for this type of intervention.

To ease the existing barriers, given not only by the economic difficulty and access to incentives for citizens but also by a need for cultural change that can facilitate the electrification of consumption in private households, Roma Capitale is moving towards several parallel directions while also creating opportunities: thanks to ENEA, a study was carried out on the incentives and tax breaks related to energy efficiency in the area. These results show the extent to which the measures are being implemented and serve as a starting point for future projections and scenarios in the private housing sector.

The Italian Government is in the process of updating the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan. This represents an occasion for the entire country but also for Roma Capitale which, together with the other 8 Italian 'Mission Cities', has presented specific observations and suggestions addressed to private citizens and the entire urban ecosystem.

# ERP energy renovation
ROMA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The stock of public housing managed by the Municipality and Ater will be the priority in the redevelopment interventions for both social and energy reasons, given the current condition of abandon which characterize the structures. Today there is no incentive system that can accelerate these interventions, after the weakening of the Superbonus and given the shortcoming of the Thermal Account. To make these interventions possible, a guarantee fund is needed to access the credit at subsidized rates for the energy redevelopment of buildings, the installation of solar panels and the creation of energy communities, which would allow interventions to be carried out in neighbourhoods and buildings where low-income families live.

The social housing heritage of Rome is extensive with about 25,000 dwellings owned by the municipality by itself, to which are included those owned by the Lazio Region and the housing of individual citizens who have purchased ownership over the years. The large number of dwellings and the plurality of subjects involved does not facilitate the decision-making process necessary to put into practice efficiency and energy saving measures.

Another barrier is the lack of knowledge of consumption and the state of the social housing units. An opportunity, however, is drawing by the study which is currently carried out for the Municipality of Rome Capitale on the mapping of social housing buildings. The outputs will give a more detailed picture about the structures and detailed information necessary to carry out future project of renovation on energy saving and RES production.

A further opportunity is given by the increasing access to PPP - Public-Private Partnership contracts which, if applied to social housing buildings' renovations, could lead to a boost towards the energy requalification of this complex category of real estate assets.

The energy redevelopment of public housing assets has been identified as one of the priority strategies for Rome Capitale.

## Sustainable mobility

For the implementation of the interventions planned by the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan of Rome - i.e. the construction of line D, the extensions of lines A and B, the construction of the seven tram lines and the adjustments of the existing lines - it is estimated that there will be a need for about 15 billion in investments in the coming years.

Specific and additional resources should be allocated to strengthen the current inadequate public transport service that are made available through the National Transport Fund (which allocates 40% less per capita allocations than in Milan), in order to increase the frequency of subways, buses and trams in circulation: the estimation for the city of Rome requires almost 160 million euros per year by the Ministry of Transport as part of the national transport fund.

For what concern the private vehicle fleet, the replacement included in the CCC's actions and strategies are related to the renovation of private cars and commercial vehicles with electric vehicles which leads to an estimated cost of 13.6 billion euros.

## Electrical distribution networks

The electricity distribution network operator, Areti, estimates additional investments of 3.8 billion euros by 2030, compared to those in progress planned in its business plan, to ensure the resilience of the grid to the climate change impacts, through interventions to recover the obsolescence of the network and the replacement of the oldest equipment of the grid; moreover, the estimation requires 1 billion euros for the introduction of storage systems for peaks in electricity demand, necessary to ensure the flexibility of an increasingly distributed and articulated system such as production, storage, consumption.

## Decarbonisation benefits for citizens and businesses

Considering the whole range of buildings, the public and private ones, the institutional ones, the tertiary and the industrials - the energy efficiency measures presented in the Climate City Contract

would lead to a significant reduction in gas consumption, with savings in bills estimated at current prices of about 600 million euros per year.

On the other hand, it is necessary to consider an increase in consumption due to the electrification of heating systems and the production of domestic hot water equal to 6% for an expense of about 120 million euros.

At the same time, developing the potential of solar photovoltaic that can be installed in Rome generates direct benefits in self-consumption, sharing in energy communities, and selling to the grid. At current market prices, the valorisation of electricity production from photovoltaics (savings in bills from self-consumption and transfer of excess energy to the grid) can generate an estimated economic value of around €580 million per year.

Overall, it can be estimated a reduction in energy expenditure of 1 billion euros for the citizens and businesses of Rome who, moreover, would no longer be subject to the fluctuations in gas prices on the international market. It should also be considered that the investment expenditure is calculated on the current data available about technologies' prices which are constantly uncertain and on the prospects of increases in efficiency for solar panels, storage systems, heat pumps.

## Ancient Rome, archaeological sites

Rome, the Eternal City, is famous for its rich history and cultural heritage. However, this same historical richness implies unique challenges on the path to climate neutrality, especially for the transport sector.

During construction and infrastructure development work, important archaeological finds are often discovered which cause delays in construction projects and create barriers to mobility.

For example, during the works for the construction of the new Piazza Pia, archaeological finds were found that required a delay in the project timeframe. In another case, during excavations for the new water system in the Appio Latino district, three mausoleums were discovered along the ancient Via Latina. Despite these challenges, Rome is trying to find a balance between infrastructural development and the preservation of historical heritage. For example, the city is working to integrate archaeological finds into urban design and to use innovative technologies to reduce the impact of development projects on historical heritage.

Furthermore, a key point for Rome would be to act directly in these cases which are currently mainly linked to the Ministry of Culture which has direct responsibility and decision-making power over the protection, enhancement and enjoyment of the national cultural heritage.

In conclusion, Rome's path towards environmental sustainability is a complex and challenging journey, but also full of opportunities. Each archaeological discovery represents a window into the city's past, enriching the urban development with new historical and cultural connections.

## Building strong institutional cooperation

A further barrier/challenge is related to the definition of a strong institutional cooperation which brings cities at the centre of the debate. The Climate City Contract is the tool that can make it possible and can accelerate the achievement of the objectives of the European Green Deal starting from the cities through a strong and virtuous integration with national policies. In fact, the urban areas are responsible of the highest demand for energy, transport and materials and it is where integrated interventions can be carried out to enhance and multiply the contribution of renewable sources and energy efficiency, in neighbourhoods and buildings where ambitious results in terms of climate mitigation and adaptation can be achieved. In Italy, reasoning of this type is especially valid if it refers to Rome, the municipality with the largest population, the largest number of private and public buildings and by far the largest territory of a unique Municipality in the whole country.

To become credible, this hypothesis requires that cities, and in particular the larger ones, are involved in the definition of policies and plans through a co-design of priorities and actions, in order to make the results more effective. The State and partly the Regions have still the competence on financing

the energy transition, as well as the regulatory power to simplify the approval procedures for projects concerning energy efficiency and renewable energy plants. In addition, an important part of Rome's public heritage is owned by the State (Ministries, Public Bodies, military headquarters) and a part by the Lazio Region (ASL, over 50 thousand public housing units) so it will be important to share the energy redevelopment objectives. An involvement of cities and collaboration between different institutional levels will be essential for the achievement of the objectives of the Climate City Contract. About the PNIEC (Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan) it is worthy to remember that while during the drafting and approval there was not the involvement of the cities, in its implementation phase it is desirable a strong collaboration if the European targets have to be achieved. In Rome, more than  $60\%$  of greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings, so an important area of institutional cooperation will have to concern the drafting by 2026, as required by the EPBD (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive), of the National Plan for the Renovation of Buildings (both residential and non-residential and public and private) to identify priority interventions in terms of energy consumption and issues of households, in order to achieve the decarbonisation by 2050. Furthermore, since cities are carrying out a just transition in to order to face the greatest social and economic issues, it is necessary a debate on the National Plan that the Italian government should approve to carry out the measures and invest the resources of the Social Climate Fund to lower energy poverty and the strengthening sustainable mobility for the benefit of the poorest subjects, and which must involve indeed the suburbs of large Italian urban areas.

# Training for green jobs

All the analyses confirm the significant potential for the creation of new jobs in Rome in the energy and mobility sector through interventions that aim to enhance the efficient use of energy for cooling and heating homes, self-production and sharing from renewable sources, the retrofit of buildings and the integrated management of plants and the territorial supply chains. The boost of the energy and digital transition, which are now deeply on-going, will depend on the ability to train workers with the technical skills required for the new professions that are taking hold in those sectors which are experiencing valuable and rapid transformation. To strengthen this perspective, it is necessary to put in place a strong institutional collaboration with the Lazio Region (which is entrusted with the competence in the field of vocational training), the Ministry of Labour and other competent institutions, business and workers' associations in order to identify the gaps in terms of skills and competences to be filled, the interventions necessary to update, strengthen and improve the training offer.

The following table shows the 80 stakeholders involved in the Mission. The details of the individual actions will be presented in Module B. The table is structured in relation to the system in which the stakeholder acts.

As can be seen from the stakeholder table presented above, the stakeholders have been grouped into categories in order to be able to make a mapping that highlights how the various participating entities can be grouped into specific nuclei of interest. For example, all the entities operating in the energy sector have been grouped together, as well as all the Foundations or credit institutions. This categorization will also help in the future to carry out targeted actions for the continuation of stakeholder engagement. Below is the representation of the number of stakeholders by category, with the exclusion of the Departments of Rome Capital indicated above.

# 3 Part B - Pathway to climate neutrality by 2030

This section represents the central core of the Action Plan in terms of emissions reduction as it includes the essential elements that combine the scenarios, the strategic objectives, the impacts, the portfolio of actions, the indicators for monitoring and evaluating the work of the Administration.

# 3.1 Module B-1 Climate neutrality scenarios and impacts

In order to identify the impact pathways linked to the portfolio of actions, the Theory of Change has been applied, as also suggested by NZC. The ToC started from the so-called causal chain made up of 5 elements at the basis of which there is the identification of a purpose/objective, i.e. a macro action that the Administration or Institution wants to pursue/implement.

The five elements of the causal chain are listed and represented in the figure below:

) The problem/need is related to the problem that the Administration wants to address and should ideally answer to the question "Why does the project/plan/initiative exist?"
) The final results are the long-term results; these elements can be quantified through medium-long term KPIs
) Intermediate results are the most immediate results that the Administration expects in the short term, and that represent a thermometer that detects the progress of the action itself in the long term
) The products/tools with which the Administration acts
) The activities that the Administration implements to respond to the need/problem that has emerged.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 9: The five steps of the causal chain in the Theory of Change

Thanks to a specific two-day intensive workshop on the Theory of Change organized by AESS with an international trainer, expert in ToC, it has been worked on a first application of the ToC by choosing an extremely sensitive problem in the Rome area: the availability of social housing and its upgrade to a good energy efficiency level. Although this issue is part of the municipal agenda, as evidenced by the numerous ongoing redevelopments in the action portfolio, it is not included within the 5 impact pathways discussed and identified directly by the Climate Aim Office and presented in Figures 11-12-13-14-15. Therefore, the impact pathway on the topic of the right to housing serves as a model to exemplify the application of the ToC as presented during the AESS intensive workshop and does not fit within the macro-objectives that the Administration has set to develop in the coming years as strategic for the achievement of the climate neutrality objectives.

The following image shows the result of the analysis based on the previously exposed scheme. The expressed need, which summarizes the "problem/purpose" of the ToC, was identified in the "right to housing", as a practical example discussed during the workshop.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 10: Theory of Change applied to the "right to housing"

The issue of the "right to housing" has assumed crucial importance in large cities like Rome in recent years: the lack of housing and the inflationary flare-up that has inflated the cost of rents and sales has posed an important issue for the public administration, not only on the quantity of available accommodations, but also on the energy performance of the buildings. The complexity of the social housing management is given, not only by the high number of accommodations, but also by the plurality of actors involved. Some accommodations are owned by Roma Capitale, others are owned by the Lazio Region and others have, over the years, been redeemed by private owners. The right to housing does not only concern the energy efficiency and maintenance of accommodations, but also the development of neighbouring areas to provide inhabitants with services and green areas. The presence of participatory processes, as well highlighted in module C of the present document, has characterized the development of several projects at local level: this involvement not only makes citizens more responsible but raises their awareness ending up on the proposal of concrete initiatives to be applied in the territory.
ROMA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

The right to housing is part of the broader plan for the urban redevelopment of public spaces which represents a challenge for the Administration.

Based on what presented above, in agreement with the Climate Office and the internal Departments of Roma Capitale, the 5 strategic macro-objectives in 2030, have been defined:

Electrification and decarbonisation of the territory
Energy efficiency of civil and industrial buildings
Sustainable mobility
Water and waste management
Development of green heritage

For each of these macro-objectives, an impact pathway has been implemented taking into consideration the systemic levers defined by the Theory of Change according to the scheme previously explained.

In the following figures, each action is traced back to one or more systemic levers (indicated with coloured dots in the following diagrams). The definition of actions has not been intended as exhaustive in defining the objective itself given the complexity and breadth of many of the objectives analysed.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 11: Systemic levers

Among the relevant elements of the Theory of Change there is also the identification of co-benefits: a clear and complete understanding of the potential collateral benefits and the way in which they are interconnected, can help the Administration to identify indirect impacts and evaluate their effects.

# B-1: Description of Impact Pathways

The infographics presented highlight the potential macro-actions on which to act, the respective impacts and the ways in which to monitor both qualitatively and quantitatively the initiatives undertaken.

Within the Theory of Change it is important to also highlight the direct impacts that the identified problem/need aims to address and to which Roma Capitale is committed.

In the macro-action relating to the electrification and decarbonisation of the territory, the main impacts that the activities implemented by the Administration and the entire urban eco-system want to achieve are:

) less dependence on non-renewable fossil sources
) increase local energy production, to achieve energy independence.
) increase the awareness of citizens and of trade associations on the electrification potential that involves them.

To achieve these objectives, the presence of incentives and information desks is fundamental for transversal involvement and for the diffusion of efficient solutions. The incentives for the installation of new RES plants are fundamental but the indirect advantage on the bill that the individual citizen can obtain through a reconversion of their consumption should not be forgotten. The electrification objectives also concern the conversion of both, public and private fleet, and the implementation of the needed infrastructure.

The increase in electricity consumption raises the issue of the resilience of the national electricity grid at national level: the commitment of Roma Capitale, in synergy with other local administrations, must be in the direction of bringing the issue at a national level.

The action related to the efficiency of civil and industrial buildings, defines the following direct impacts:

) overcoming regulatory constraints for the efficiency of heritage buildings
) reduction of energy consumption
) increase in energy production from renewable sources.

Technological innovations, the improvement of materials, the definition of precise standards for efficiency promise great improvements in the coming years in this area which still represents the most relevant sector, in terms of emissions, for the city of Rome (60% of the baseline). The administration, also through raising the awareness of other entities in the private sector and associations, is also heavily investing.

The mobility sector represents the second sector with the highest number of emissions (34% of the total baseline value) in Rome. Therefore, the topic of sustainable mobility has a high relevance for the Administration. The direct impacts that Roma Capitale aims for are:

) reduction of emissions from fossil fuels because of reduced traffic
) improvement of the LPT offer
) reduction in private consumption from transport
) development of sharing economy services.

The Administration is working through awareness campaigns to increase the use of sustainable mobility also by public and private companies. The smart working solutions adopted by various companies have guaranteed an improvement in city livability thanks to a massive reduction in urban traffic. Numerous interventions of great impact are planned considering the events that the city of Rome is preparing to host (Jubilee 2025).

Water and waste management is bound to the updating of legislation, not always in line with the modernization of the sector. Among the main impacts in which the Administration is investing are:

) technological innovations for reducing the impact of emissions
) reduction of waste sent to landfill

The direct impacts that the Administration expects go in concert with the awareness, training and participation campaigns that it is carrying out (see Module C). These same objectives must involve the private sector equally.

The green heritage in the city of Rome necessarily involves the updating of municipal plans: the complexity and heterogeneity of the urban green context requires a broad level of involvement of the public sector to guarantee coherent and long-term development. Among the direct impacts foreseen by the Administration for this macro-action are:

) reduction of climate change gases and of climate impacts on central urban areas
) increase in the municipal tree budget and green spaces
) reduction of the phenomenon of heat waves

The solutions implemented must also include innovative Natural Based Solutions that involve other entities operating in the sector: some of them have presented actions included in the portfolio of this Action Plan.

# 3.2 Module B-2 Design of the Climate Neutrality Portfolio

The Capitoline Administration has been engaged for several years within its municipal territory in the planning and implementation of concrete actions aimed at mitigating climate change emissions through specific plans and strategies, as already exposed in Part A of this document.

The Climate City Contract fits into a context that is already highly aware of the issue at both public and private level. The added value that the Action Plan wants to bring refers to the specific actions that the signatories of the CCC have presented as a contribution to the reduction of emissions in the city of Rome. The objective of this chapter is therefore to highlight the individual actions and expose their main characteristics.

The portfolio of actions is the result of a co-planning process initiated by the Climate Office together with the stakeholders, thanks to the Expression of Interest tool, fully described in Module C-1. The involvement work, conducted in a synergic manner among all the actors, led to the identification not only of the actions and impacts on the city, but also of barriers and opportunities that represent key elements for the city's future development vision. The role of the internal departments of Roma Capitale which coordinated the work together with the Climate Office should not be forgotten. Among those who presented significant contributions in the formation of the portfolio, a total of 30 actions and initiatives, there are:

Department of Environmental Protection
Department of Heritage and Housing Policies
Department of Infrastructure Development and Urban Maintenance
Department of Major Events, Sport, Tourism and Fashion
Department of Social Policies and Health
Department of Sustainable Mobility and Transport
Department of Urban Planning and Implementation

The stakeholder engagement process involved 80 stakeholders at territorial level who submitted 705 action sheets through the Expression of Interest procedure: 493 actions emerged from these. The portfolio actions presented by internal stakeholders (Departments of Roma Capitale) are 30, therefore the total number of actions is 523.

Given the large number of initiatives, a clustering of the portfolio's actions was defined to provide greater coherence and to carry out an analysis as coherent as possible with the administration's stated objectives. Here are the 14 action categories selected from the 5 impact pathways.

RES installations: initiatives and projects involving the installation of systems based on renewable energy technology, in particular solar photovoltaics, which are planned to be installed both on the roofs of buildings and on the ground; this category also includes interventions that, as part of the establishment of Renewable Energy Communities, envisage the installation of RES.
Electricity infrastructure upgrading and/or efficiency-building: actions to make electricity infrastructure more efficient and upgrade it, in order to ensure the resilience of the grid and support the electrification process of energy consumption; this category also includes the upgrading of local public lighting.
Green electricity purchase: actions involving the purchase of electricity with a Guarantee of Origin from renewable sources, to cover part or all of the electricity consumption.
Civil building upgrading/efficiency: actions to upgrade and improve the energy efficiency of public and private buildings, ERP, university facilities and schools, theatres; among the most relevant interventions are the replacement of methane boilers and refrigeration units, electrification of thermal systems (e.g. heat pumps), relamping of indoor lighting and
ROMA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

interventions to reduce the transmittance of dispersing surfaces (such as thermal insulation and replacement of window frames), to reduce emissions and increase, at the same time, the indoor thermal comfort.

Redevelopment/efficiency of industrial buildings: actions that include the same energy efficiency measures as those in the civil buildings category but concerning industrial plants.
Energy efficiency of industrial plants and processes: actions that concern in particular the replacement of electric motors, steam generators, purification plants, the installation of software to manage and control the consumption of production processes and actions to reduce the release of greenhouse gas emissions other than $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.
Electrification and/or vehicle fleet efficiency: actions that include the efficiency, with reduced-emission vehicles, or electrification of private company fleets and public transport, the installation of recharging stations, and forms of incentive for the purchase of electric cars and/or the replacement of polluting vehicles.
Sustainable mobility: this category includes plans for smart working, car sharing and carpooling initiatives, the adoption of an internal mobility manager, projects to raise awareness of the use of local public transport, initiatives to reduce traffic through LTZs/green areas, and the implementation of the cycling route network.
Wastewater/waste treatment: actions concern initiatives for the valorisation of waste and wastewater, through technologically advanced solutions such as bio-digesters for the production of bio-methane and plants for the recovery of biogas from wastewater, projects for the development of hydrogen from urban waste, the reuse of wastewater and interventions to reduce leaks from the distribution network.
Waste reduction: Actions cover the adoption of sustainable practices to reduce waste production and the valorisation of waste for new uses, the enhancement of separate waste collection and activities to raise awareness on recovery and reuse.
Green infrastructure: this category includes actions such as the reforestation of areas of the city, the recovery of abandoned green areas and the planting of trees and shrubs in parks and gardens, also for educational and information/awareness-raising purposes.
Energy Management/Management Systems: including initiatives for the implementation of company management systems, such as ISO 50001 and 14001, the appointment of the Energy Manager and the drafting of Energy Diagnoses for the purpose of a continuous process of energy efficiency of the building-plant system; also included are actions related to monitoring and reduction of consumption, through IoT platforms, BMS, etc.
Training/awareness-raising: actions included in this category concern awareness-raising campaigns on environmental and energy issues, training courses, courses and information training projects on environmental sustainability issues, aimed at all segments of the population.
Adaptation: purely climatic adaptation actions, such as river and coastal embankments, depaving, reducing the heat island effect, necessary to prepare the territory to face the increase in extreme climatic phenomena.

The table below shows the total number of actions per category of action divided between internal and external stakeholders: a consistent prevalence emerges for the initiatives to upgrade both civil and industrial buildings, including energy efficiency measures. This is followed, in terms of quantity, by training actions and awareness-raising courses aimed at citizens and employees in cross-cutting areas such as sustainable mobility, reuse and recycling, and sustainable energy and resource management.

Each individual action was further marked with one of the following attributes:

Measurable action;
Behavioural action;
Guidelines/governance action;
adaptation action.

Measurable actions are those that are directly quantifiable in terms of climate-changing emissions and/or on an economic level. Behavioural actions, on the other hand, relate to training, information and knowledge enhancement events that can imply changes in life habits and increase sensitivity and awareness towards issues close to the Mission's objectives. Governance actions are those that directly impact the policies, regulations and innovation of governance of the municipal territory. Finally, given the relevance of the topic for the policies and strategies of Roma Capitale, a new category, adaptation, was introduced, in view of the diverse nature of the intervention and type of impact.

Moreover, to complete the contribution of all the stakeholders, the overall 523 actions also include all the actions, named under study, which are currently being defined in terms of modalities and timeframe. In fact, the document's broad time horizon allows it to be considered in all respects as actions that contribute to the reduction of the city's climate-changing emissions, the development of which will be effective in the coming years. The Administration has also included some stakeholders within the Plan whose initiatives impact take place outside the municipal boundary of the CCC. In total, 13 actions have been presented by these stakeholders: the decision to include them is motivated by their relevance, particularly in terms of investment, and by the impact they generate on the municipal territory of Rome. The contribution in terms of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  emissions reduction of these stakeholders has therefore not been accounted for in order to respect the boundaries established for the CCC (geographical boundary of Roma Capitale). The detail of these actions, the proposing stakeholders and their level of impact is reported in the annex in Table B-2.2e.

The following table shows an overview of all 523 actions contained within the portfolio, classified according to sector and action category. The details of all the actions collected are shown in the annexes following the classification defined below.

Annex 5 - Table B-2.2d: detail of adaptation actions.
Annex 6 - Table B-2.2e: detail of actions outside the perimeter of Rome.

In the attached tables, for each action there is evidence of the proposing stakeholder, the reference sector, the category, the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  reduction value, the timing and the systemic levers on which the intervention acts. The value reported in the "  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  emission reduction" column therefore follows the methodology which, starting from the activity data made available by the stakeholders, expresses the contribution of the individual action to the reduction of baseline emissions based on the conversion factors already explained in Module A. In some cases, the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  reduction value reported by the stakeholder was directly entered, once the calculation methodology used had been verified. Whenever it was not possible to calculate the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  value, the indication "N.A." (or "-") is reported: in this case, the specific value was not made available by the relevant stakeholder, but the action was still considered being relevant on other aspect (e.g. citizen involvement, sector of interest, etc.). Monitoring these projects in 2030 will, if possible, highlight this more precisely soon. The value of the investment per single action of the stakeholders is not reported in this document but it will be specified in the Investment Plan.

The tables below summarise the reduction of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  emissions, grouped by type of action, as subsets of the 523 actions:

296 measurable actions (see table below) implemented or being implemented by external stakeholders and municipal departments, with the largest overall contribution in terms of yearly emission reductions, amounting to 323,895 tCO $_2$ eq.

The results presented so far refer exclusively to the contribution of the actions collected by the stakeholders who signed the document and by the internal departments of the Administration of Roma Capitale. Their involvement represents an important piece in the path that the city of Rome has undertaken to achieve climate neutrality, but it is not the only contribution that goes to determine the actual achievement of the objective.

The strategic lines that Roma Capitale proposes to implement with a 2030-time horizon represent a fundamental step in the path towards the neutrality of the entire municipal territory. These strategies have been divided into two blocks, CCC Strategies and Enhanced CCC Strategies, on the basis of the different effort required for the objectives of these scenarios to be fully achieved.

At the end of the analysis, the final graph will show the overall emission reduction result, which integrates all the elements analysed so far, namely:

# Growth in renewable energy production

As far as renewable energy sources are concerned, the growth of solar photovoltaic systems continues, with a strong acceleration of installations in recent years: from 13,007 systems installed at the end of 2019, the base inventory year, with a total capacity of 160 MW, to 21,846 as of December 2023 (GSE data), for a total of 230 MW, of which about  $60\%$  installed on the roofs of the city's buildings. In addition, the city can count on the contribution of hydroelectric plants, such as the barrier on the Tiber River at Castel Giubileo, with an installed power of 17 MW, as well as smaller plants installed on the aqueduct network. As far as buildings owned by the municipal administration are concerned, a total of 1.92 MW of photovoltaic systems are currently installed on schools, offices and other facilities, for a total of 163 buildings. Projects underway thanks to the contribution of the NRP and European, regional and national resources will allow 10 MW to be installed by 2026, to which will be added Project Financing projects proposed by private actors on Roma Capitale facilities.

In spite of the exponential growth of photovoltaics in recent years, as the above stated data show, driven in particular by the residential and industrial sectors, the production of renewable energy in the Rome area is still insufficient to cover a significant share of electricity consumption.

The 2030 strategy aims at a strong growth in the installation of solar photovoltaic systems, favoured by the potential of the Roma Capitale territory, not only for the considerable availability of covered areas, but also for the presence of numerous large parking areas (photovoltaic on shelters) and for the large extension of agricultural land, where it is possible to integrate agri-voltaic plants. The goal is to valorise the different configurations of installations that are competitive today: in self-consumption to serve activities and households, for sale to the grid or (for large plants) through Power Purchase Agreement models; in shared energy configurations, such as Energy Communities (with respect to which a specific

regulation has been approved for promotion) and Collective Self-consumption. In 2024, Roma Capitale approved a Regulation for the creation of Solidarity Energy Communities on plants and roofs owned by the Municipality for Third Sector entities and a simplification for the installation of solar energy on roofs in the Technical Implementation Regulations of the Town Planning Regulations.

A specific study, prepared for the Climate City Contract by AESS, identified the potential of solar photovoltaic systems that could be installed in the territory of the Municipality of Rome. The activity is part of the strategies of Rome for the medium-long term relating to the production and use of renewable electricity. The knowledge of the photovoltaic potential, in terms of kWp, and the most suitable solutions of installations, is a great opportunity for a further broad development of this renewable source in the municipal area.

The results show a theoretical potential for photovoltaic installation on building roofs of about 3.4 GWp which corresponds, considering an average annual producibility of  $1,250\mathrm{kWh / kWp}$ , to an energy production of approximately 4.2 TWh/y. The estimate of the potential for installing photovoltaic systems on roofs within Rome starts from the analysis conducted on the total surface area of the roofs of the buildings in the municipal territory, which can be classified mainly into residential, tertiary and industrial. These results were obtained by identifying the surfaces potentially available for the installation of photovoltaic systems and applying appropriate coefficients obtained empirically or analytically. For the purpose of estimating only the additional potential of photovoltaics on buildings, the following contributions were subtracted from the result of the aforementioned study: the installed power as of 2019 (CCC baseline year), the installed power between 2020 and 2023, falling almost exclusively under the Superbonus, and what has already been defined by the SECAP and stakeholder actions in terms of installation of rooftop photovoltaic systems. The additional potential obtained is 2.7 GWp, with an expected annual production of over 3.4 TWh. Within the CCC strategy,  $60\%$  of the total additional potential was assumed to be installed, corresponding to about 1.6 GWp of power and an estimated annual production of about 2.1 TWh/y of electrical energy.

Within the above-mentioned study, the photovoltaic potential on canopy in the largest parking areas was also evaluated. Parking areas serving shopping centres, hospitals and universities as well as interchange car parks were analysed. The results were obtained by assessing the suitability of the car parks to accommodate photovoltaic shelters (conformation, presence of trees, etc.), and simulating the coverage of parking spaces with shelters for each of them. The analysis resulted in the identification of 93 large car parks considered suitable for photovoltaic covers. The potential obtained is approximately 101 MWp, with an expected annual production of 130 GWh (producibility of 1,287 kWh/kWp). Within the CCC strategy,  $60\%$  of the total additional potential was assumed to be installed, corresponding to about 60 MWp of installed capacity and an estimated annual production of about 78 GWh of electricity.

Finally, given the large size of the municipal territory,  $1,287\mathrm{km}^2$ , of which more than  $75\%$  is unconsumed land, assessments were made of the potential of agri-voltaic that can be integrated into the agricultural surface. With regard to the CCC strategy, the installation of about 500 MWp of agri-voltaic capacity was assumed, with an estimated annual production of about 700 GWh, which corresponds to 200,000 tCO2eq in terms of reducing climate-changing emissions. This power would occupy an agricultural area of 7.9 square kilometre, equal to  $1.2\%$  of the total agricultural territory, and  $0.6\%$  of the entire municipal territory of Rome.

The contributions in terms of GHG emission reduction of the CCC strategies described above are summarised here:

Photovoltaic installations on buildings: 582,140 tCO $_2$ eq/y
Photovoltaic installations on canopies in parking lot: 22,167 tCO $_2$ eq/y
Agri-voltaic: 200,000 tCO $_2$ eq/y

In view of achieving more ambitious results, in line with the target of an 80% reduction of climate-changing emissions, further growth of photovoltaics in Rome was evaluated through the development of three enhanced CCC strategies. The following assumptions were used for these analyses: installation of the remaining 40% of the total additional photovoltaic potential on roofs (approx. 1,100 MWp for a production of 1.4 TWh/y); installation of the remaining 40% of the photovoltaic potential on carport roofs (approx. 40 MWp); doubling of the installed capacity of agri-voltaic plants (this enhanced strategy includes only the additional quota, an additional 500 MWp), which means the total occupation of 2.4% of the total agricultural area of the municipal territory of Rome.

The contributions in terms of GHG emission reduction of the enhanced CCC scenarios, to be added to the CCC scenarios described above, are summarised here:

Photovoltaic installations on buildings: 388,093 tCO₂eq/y
Photovoltaic installations on canopies in parking lot: 14,778 tCO₂eq/y
Agri-voltaic: 200,000 tCO₂eq/y

The analyses described above have been developed using a precautionary approach: no photovoltaic systems have been installed within the UNESCO Perimeter and, to a limited extent, on the roofs of buildings in the areas included in the Quality Charter; only the most extensive car parks have been taken into consideration; the occupation of agricultural areas with agri-voltaic systems has been assumed not to exceed 1.5% of the territorial extension of the Municipality of Rome.

Residential building efficiency and electrification of thermal systems

In Rome in recent years, several energy requalification interventions of private residential buildings have been carried out that have had access to state tax deductions. In particular, the Superbonus has been the starting point for a massive energy renovation of the residential building stock of Rome, a fundamental turning point in order to reduce energy consumption in one of the most impactful sectors, in terms of carbon footprint.

A specific study, elaborated for the Climate City Contract by Enea⁷, estimates that with the Superbonus incentive, energy requalification interventions have been carried out in the period 2021-2024 on 6,896 buildings, of which 2,522 condominiums, for a total investment of approximately 3.55 billion euros and a reduction of at least two energy classes. In addition, 8,158 photovoltaic systems were installed as part of the Superbonus incentive, with a total capacity of 51.2 MWp. As far as the Ecobonus incentive is concerned, ENEA's estimate refers to about 156,700 energy efficiency interventions carried out in the 2020-2023 period, equal to over 1.1 billion euros. Moreover, about 150 schools, and over 1,000 public social housing units, libraries, theatres, and museums are undergoing energy requalification interventions with resources from the Recovery Plan, state, regional, and municipal funds.

These results show the extent to which the measures are being implemented and serve as a starting point for future projections and scenarios. In fact, Roma Capitale's 2030 strategy aims to consolidate the process of energy efficiency in municipal buildings through: the insulation of building envelopes, the electrification of heating systems, the implementation of energy consumption management systems, the installation of renewable energy systems integrated with storage batteries. These processes, now underway for some time and increasingly widespread, will play a strategic role in the decarbonisation of Roma Capitale, given that the largest share of the capital's emissions comes from this sector.

The objective is to ensure NZEB (Near Zero Energy building) or ZEB (Zero energy building) performance in urban regeneration processes, pursuant to the new European Directive on Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EPBD), while at the same time accelerating the energy redevelopment of public and private building stock, with well-defined performance targets to be achieved in reducing consumption and

emissions. The Municipality's Building Regulations are being revised to accelerate and incentivise climate mitigation and adaptation measures. The aim is to progressively eliminate the use of fossil fuels for domestic heating (starting with the most energy-intensive buildings and where it is technically feasible), replacing them with integrated systems consisting of heat pumps or other efficient heating systems, low-enthalpy geothermal systems and photovoltaic systems for self-consumption or within energy communities.

As far as the buildings owned by Roma Capitale are concerned, the objective is to achieve the progressive decarbonisation of the entire heritage, using intervention models involving public-private partnerships for the implementation of energy upgrading and management through EPCs (Energy Performance Contracts), the electrification of heating systems, self-production through photovoltaic systems integrated, wherever possible, with geothermal systems, and the purchase of electricity from renewable sources with a guarantee of origin.

With regard to the energy renovation of Rome's residential building stock, both public and private, through interventions on the envelope (reduction of transmittances), and the efficiency/electrification of thermal systems, a study was carried out in order to estimate the potential for intervention by 2030 in terms of reducing energy consumption and, consequently, tCO₂eq emissions. In particular, in order to elaborate the CCC strategies, in line with the objectives of the 2023 Climate Plan, interventions on the efficiency and/or electrification of thermal systems were mainly considered (on about 80% of the buildings), while only on a small percentage of the buildings were hypothesised interventions on the envelope (about 20%). Through the implementation of these interventions, an estimated reduction in primary energy consumption of more than 2,700 TWh/y would be achieved between private and public residential buildings - ERP. The contributions in terms of GHG emission reduction of the CCC strategies described above are summarised below:

Energy renovation of residential buildings: 486,670 tCO₂eq/y
Energy renovation of social housing: 38,171 tCO₂eq/y

With a view to achieving more ambitious results in line with climate neutrality goals, further potential for energy efficiency in public and private residential buildings was evaluated through the development of two enhanced CCC strategies. To develop these strategies, only interventions on the envelope (thermal insulation, insulation of vertical and horizontal surfaces, fixtures, etc.) were considered on a further 30% of buildings, resulting in an additional reduction in primary energy consumption estimated at around 1,600 TWh/y (between private and ERP). In terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the following results are obtained:

Energy renovation of residential buildings: 264,450 tCO₂eq/y
Energy renovation of social housing: 20,661 tCO₂eq/y

Decarbonisation tertiary and industry sector

As regards, on the other hand, the energy efficiency of buildings in the tertiary and industrial sectors, an analysis was made starting from the forecasts of changes in energy consumption to 2030 reported in the Lazio Regional Energy Plan⁸. With regard to the aforementioned sectors, a gradual reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels for heating, up to about 50% of the current ones, and an increase of a few percentage points in the consumption of electrical energy (more marked in the industrial sector) is expected by 2030. In particular, the reduction in the consumption of methane, fuel oil and diesel oil will mainly be the consequence of interventions on the envelope, for the insulation of dispersing surfaces, and the electrification of thermal systems, while the consumption of electrical energy will increase slightly due to the effect of electrification processes, despite the associated interventions of relamping lighting

and making refrigeration units more efficient. The results in terms of climate-altering emission reduction are summarised below:

Energy efficiency improvements of tertiary sector buildings and headquarters: 150,420 tCO₂eq/y
Energy efficiency improvements of industrial sector: 102,124 tCO₂eq/y

Integrated and zero emission mobility

In Rome, as part of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), interventions on public transport are planned and currently underway, which aim to increase rail public transport and electrify road transport, through some actions: such as completion of Metro C, new tram lines, purchase of electric buses, increase in tram convoys and metro trains. Furthermore, actions are planned to increase soft mobility, such as the creation of new cycle paths, and a limited traffic zone within the so called "Green Area". The strategy for 2030 aims at an increasingly integrated, electric, sustainable mobility offer, continuing in the direction set by the SUMP of strengthening the rail public transport system with connections in every urban area, the progressive electrification of all roads public transport and the use of zero-emission systems, the extension of the network of cycle paths, pedestrian areas and 30 km/h zones. The city-wide sharing mobility offer of bicycles, scooters, electric cars, the presence of charging stations for electric vehicles, the integrated mobility offer through the digitisation of data as envisaged by the MaaS project will be extended to the entire built-up area.

A reduction in the climate impact of the transport sector cannot, however, ignore the progressive replacement of the oldest fleet of cars and private commercial vehicles, and, in particular, a significant increase in registrations of zero-emission vehicles (Battery Electric Vehicles) or almost zero-emission vehicles (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles). Therefore, the topic of the electrification of private mobility must represent one of the key objectives of the Administration for 2030.

Starting from the 2030 forecasts on the numbers of the private fleet of cars and commercial vehicles in Rome, developed by Roma Servizio Mobilità (RSM), a study was developed that allowed us to estimate the reduction in CO₂eq emissions due to the increase in electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs). As far as passenger cars are concerned, the share of circulating electric vehicles in 2030 was estimated on the basis of the forecasts of the PNIEC 2024⁹, resulting in a 17% share of the total number of cars circulating in the capital by 2030. For light and heavy commercial vehicles, the estimated share circulating in Rome in 2030 is 10% of the total. The strategy was developed by initially calculating the consumption of Rome's vehicle fleet to 2030 without the expected share of electric vehicles, thus considering only an increase in more efficient traditional fuel vehicles to replace the current ones with lower emission classes (Euro 0, 1, 2, etc.). This scenario was then transformed by introducing the percentage of electric vehicles previously established, resulting in a reduction in the consumption of traditional fuels (petrol, diesel, etc.) and an increase in electricity consumption. This methodology was used for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles. The study yielded a total savings figure attributable to the CCC electrification of the vehicle fleet strategy of approximately 231,000 tonnes of CO₂eq/y.

Roma Capitale is already implementing structural changes in working modes for its employees, through the agile working initiative defined in the SECAP, which will involve all Capitoline employees in the coming years. This working mode is currently, as it will be in the years to come, being introduced more and more in the organisation of work in all areas of the public sector, in controlled and participated companies, and in private enterprises.

O

For this paper, to achieve Rome's climate neutrality, a specific CCC strategy on smart working has been developed, assessing the impact of agile working to 2030 if extended to all employees in Rome, both in the public and private sectors (altogether over 1 million workers). The assumptions used to develop this strategy are as follows: an average of two days a week working from home; composition of the private car fleet in 2030 according to the results of the analysis on the electrification of vehicles, therefore also including a 17% of electric cars in circulation; an average home-work commute in the municipality of Rome based on previous research. By calculating the reduction of fuel consumption and electricity absorbed (EVs), the result in terms of climate-changing emissions reduction was obtained, which attributes a saving of over 300,000 tCO₂eq/y to the CCC "smart working" strategy.

Purchase of green energy

A further strategy implemented in the Climate City Contract concerns green energy and green public procurement. The dialogue process with stakeholders made it possible to highlight the many actions planned to purchase green energy with a Guarantee of Origin (hereinafter GoO) to cover part of the electricity consumption of tertiary and industrial sectors.

The intention is to support this path on the part of companies and the public administration, with Roma Capitale's commitment to expand the minimum environmental criteria provided by Italian law and Green Public Procurement in all tenders and also in the purchase of electricity from the grid.

To elaborate the CCC green procurement strategy, the purchase of electricity with GoO from renewable sources was assumed to cover, by 2030, 40% of the total electricity consumption of buildings in the tertiary and industry sectors. This scenario is essentially in line with the companies' energy plans to meet the 2030 targets for the reduction of total emissions generated by corporate activities. Assuming total electricity consumption in 2030 for both sectors, the estimates obtained in the energy efficiency strategies described above were considered. To avoid double counting, green purchases already included in stakeholder actions were subtracted from the results obtained. The estimate of additional green energy purchased by 2030 is approximately 1.6 TWh/y, of which more than 90% is attributable to the tertiary sector. The contributions in terms of climate-altering gas emission reduction of the CCC strategies described above are summarised below:

Purchase of electricity with certified guarantee of origin for the tertiary sector: 418,720 tCO₂eq/y
Purchase of electricity with certified guarantee of origin for the industrial sector: 31,441 tCO₂eq/y

To conclude this paragraph, the overall path to achieving climate neutrality is summarised below, starting from the baseline of 8,598,003 tCO₂eq/y.

As already widely presented, the Climate City Contact of Rome is one component of the path that has long been directed towards the definition of solutions that lead the city to the goal of climate neutrality. Therefore, the reduction of the reference baseline also includes the contribution of other fundamental strategic plans recently approved such as the Climate Plan, the Waste Plan, the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), the Climate Adaptation Strategy, the SECAP. The importance of the aforementioned plans is not only in terms of reducing emissions but also in terms of expanding the number of stakeholders, a fundamental element in the collective path of reducing emissions undertaken by the Municipal Administration.

The objective of this section is to detail each item accounted for as a reduction of the baseline. The graph below gives a visual summary followed by the specific reconstruction.

The cross-cutting nature of the topics covered by the SECAP led to the inclusion of initiatives in the following sectors:

The Buildings sector includes interventions in the installation of RES, energy upgrading of schools, public and private buildings, alternative energy solutions such as geothermal energy, and institutions of Renewable Energy Communities in the territory, as well as the efficiency of public lighting: the total contribution is 424,747 tCO $_2$ eq/y.
The Transport sector includes the emission reduction estimate for the agile work initiative that will involve all Capitoline employees in the coming years (3,990 tCO2eq/y), The substantial contribution estimated in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) will be detailed in the 'SUMP Actions' item below;
The Waste sector includes the contribution of the projects against food waste, the incentive program for the reduction of separated waste, the Green Card campaign for the correct differentiation of waste, the program for the reduction of packaging and the "Acque di Roma" project for the reduction of water distribution through plastic bottles and other projects related to the circularity of the products and the reuse of them. Overall, these initiatives bring an estimated benefit in terms of emissions reduction equal to 141,730

$\mathrm{tCO}_{2}\mathrm{eq} / \mathrm{y}$ . An additional contribution for the sector is provided by the Piano Rifiuti set out in the specific item;

The AFOLU sector includes a reforestation program, which Rome Capital has committed to reach by 2030, with an estimated reduction value of around 5.205 tCO $_2$ eq/y.

SUMP Actions: the Plan's main action lines contribute to the reduction of 715,528 tCO $_2$ eq/y. Among the most important are:

Regulation policies and ITS
Road infrastructure and interchange parking system
Intermodal Hub Plan
Realisation of new LPT infrastructures and services
Cycling Mobility Plan and supporting infrastructure
Pedestrian Mobility Plan
Mobility management and smart working policies
Renewal of hybrid/electric fleets
Support for electric vehicles (incentives and implementation)
Urban Logistics Plan
Mobility Security Plan

Of these, the item referring to new LPT infrastructure and services is the most impactful. It includes the realisation of the metro lines (Line B, C) and the railway line adjustments for the realisation of the E and F metro lines. In addition, interventions to upgrade the surface tram network are included here.

Waste Plan Actions: the contribution of the Waste Plan in the Climate City Contract is 185,536 tCO $_2$ eq/y. Among the actions included are the waste-to-energy plant, which will be operational from 2027, two new plants for the collection and recovery of paper and plastic, and the upgrading of collection centres.
Ecobonus /Superbonus incentives: The total contribution of this item is - on an annual basis  $-145,040\mathrm{tCO}_2\mathrm{eq}$ . The estimate was based on requests for Ecobonus (from 01-01-2020 to 31-12-2023) and Superbonus (from 01-01-2021 to 31-03-2024) tax deductions for energy upgrading and energy efficiency measures such as insulation, replacement of windows or fixtures, installation of thermal and photovoltaic solar panels and storage systems, upgrading of air conditioning systems and installation of infrastructure for recharging electric vehicles.
CCC actions: the value of the actions collected by external stakeholders involved with the Expression of Interest (hereafter Eol) and internal stakeholders - i.e. part of the Transition Team of Roma Capitale - totalled 347,372 tCO $_2$ eq/y. Of these, about  $93\%$  (i.e. 323,895 tCO $_2$ eq) is represented by 'planned' actions, i.e. in progress or already implemented and concluded after the baseline year. The remaining part refers to actions 'under study', i.e. still in the definition phase, for which a technical-economic feasibility plan is still lacking. In general, the 523 actions collected mainly include stakeholders external to Roma Capitale (80 responded to the Eol, for a total of 493 actions). The actions proposed by the 7 Municipal Departments total 30, a limited number, but to be evaluated in relation to the already large contribution made within the existing plans mentioned above.
Behavioural actions: behavioural actions are characterised by few variables useful for estimating their contribution to emission reduction. Based on the relevant literature (e.g. European Environment Agency), it is nevertheless possible to attribute potential energy savings due to behavioural measures on the basis of a range that varies from a minimum of  $5\%$  to a maximum of  $20\%$ , to be applied to the baseline reduction target, i.e.  $80\%$  of the overall baseline. The Administration of Roma Capitale, as extensively reported in Module C of this document,
ROMA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

has implemented significant actions and initiatives, such as to assign a weight equal to 20% as the overall contribution of all the actions underway within the city ecosystem. The total value of emissions reduced through behavioural actions is therefore estimated at approximately 1,375,681 tCO₂eq/y. The behavioural actions were categorised for the different sectors according to the following percentages in terms of emission reductions: 32.1% buildings, 64.9% transport, 0.4% waste, 2.6% IPPU.

CCC Strategies to 2030: 11 strategic actions have been defined on which to focus action between now and 2030. These strategies concern: the installation of photovoltaic systems on buildings, in car parks and in agricultural land (agri-voltaic), energy efficiency in public and private residential, tertiary and industrial buildings, green energy procurement and some actions in the transport sector, such as electrification of the vehicle fleet and smart working. Below are the annual reduction values of climate-changing emissions broken down by individual CCC strategy, totalling 2,567,362 tCO₂eq/y.

Photovoltaic installations on buildings: 582,140 tCO₂eq
Photovoltaic installations on canopies in parking lot: 22,167 tCO₂eq
Agri-voltaic: 200,000 tCO₂eq
Energy renovation of residential buildings: 486,670 tCO₂eq
Energy renovation of social housing: 38,171 tCO₂eq
Energy efficiency improvements of tertiary sector buildings and headquarters: 150,420 tCO₂eq
Energy efficiency improvements of industrial sector: 102,124 tCO₂eq
Electrification of the vehicle fleet: 231,030 tCO₂eq
Smart working 304,478 tCO₂eq
Purchase of electricity with certified guarantee of origin for the tertiary sector: 418,720 tCO₂eq
Purchase of electricity with certified guarantee of origin for the industrial sector: 31,441 tCO₂eq

Enhanced CCC Strategies to 2030: For the attainment of climate neutrality, the Administration has decided to estimate the enhancement of 5 of the CCC strategies considered most significant for the pathway to transition, whose total contribution is to be considered additional to the previous item, and equal to approximately 887,982 tCO₂eq/y. Their development represents an ambitious path that will see the municipal administration involved as facilitator of some initiatives not only at a local level, but also at a regional and national level. The annual contributions to reducing climate-changing emissions of the individual enhanced strategies are detailed below:

Photovoltaic installations on buildings: 388,093 tCO₂eq
Photovoltaic installations on canopies in parking lot: 14,778 tCO₂eq
Agri-voltaic: 200,000 tCO₂eq
Energy renovation of residential buildings: 264,450 tCO₂eq
Energy renovation of social housing: 20,661 tCO₂eq

The implementation of the enhanced CCC strategies along the 2030 time horizon is closely linked to several factors of a political, economic-financial, legislative and local ecosystem awareness nature. The path opened by the Administration with this document and the existing Plans, which have characterised its work in recent years, is intended to be a start, in order to embark on an ambitious journey to reduce emissions in line with the objectives of a fair and equitable transition.

Delta Gap: The gap value shown in the graph refers to the CO₂eq emissions left to reach 80%, net of all contributions shown below. This value is consistent with the pathway that the City has

O

embarked upon and which, in the course of future monitoring, will see continuous enhancements and improvements. This will also happen thanks to the awareness and involvement of citizens on ecological transition issues, actions that will provide the necessary impetus for the allocation of new funding, for changes in habits and lifestyles, for the development of new, more efficient technologies, and for the constant commitment of local and national politics. The final gap value of approximately 78,229 tCO₂eq/y is to be considered the starting point of the cross-sectoral co-planning pathway that the Administration is committed to pursuing until 2030.

Residual emissions: these emissions are the part of climate-altering emissions that can hardly be abated, defined in literature as 'hard to abate' since they are associated with processes, technologies and users that are unlikely, at least in the short term, to undergo energy efficiency or to benefit from the production of energy from renewable energy plants. They represent 20% of the overall baseline (1,719,610 tCO₂eq/y), as envisaged by the NetZeroCities Guidelines. Therefore, the actions to be implemented by the city to reduce the baseline exclude that 20% and will erode the remaining 80%, the CCC target of approximately 6,878,403 tCO₂eq.

The economic reference of each of these items is reported in Section B of the Investment Plan.

## B-2.3: Strategies for achieving the baseline emission reduction target

A residual part of the climate-altering emissions (20% of the baseline, equal to 1,719,600 tCO₂eq/y) are considered hard to abate, as they are associated with areas that are unlikely to undergo energy efficiency or benefit from the production of energy from renewable electrical (photovoltaic) or thermal (geothermal, solar thermal, etc.) sources. As a consequence this amount of emissions can currently only be considered absorbable through the public and private plant heritage (trees and shrubs) present within the municipal territory, which is being strengthened, as well as by adaptation measures, such as Nature Based Solutions (NBS), i.e. solutions inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective and provide simultaneous environmental, social and economic benefits, and contribute to strengthening the resilience of the territory.

As far as the buildings sector is concerned, the 'Hard to abate' category mainly includes civil and industrial users that due to geographical location (e.g. historical centre) or for building-typological characteristics are not among the buildings that will be able to benefit from energy requalification interventions by 2030 (or only partially); among the barriers considered in the requalification of buildings there are, for example, cases of structures that, due to historical, artistic and landscape constraints, cannot be insulated through external or internal insulation, are limited in the possibility of replacing windows and doors or, again, cannot provide for adequate photovoltaic systems on the roof or the installation of heat pumps. Furthermore, there are a number of industrial processes (e.g. heavy manufacturing industry) for which the replacement of currently used fossil fuels is rather complex, due to the lack of reliable alternative energy sources, immature technologies and high costs.

In the transport sector a proportion of passenger cars will continue to run on endothermic diesel or petrol engines, both because there are currently insufficient solutions on the market for the total electrification of the vehicle fleet, especially for certain usage needs, and for economic reasons, mainly with regard to lower-income population groups. Even higher is the share of heavy or light commercial vehicles that will continue to run on diesel fuel; in fact, there are several factors influencing this: the very high cost of zero-emission vehicles, technological immaturity, the scarcity of models available on the market, the need to ensure high mileage, etc. In the long run, with increasingly stringent European and national deadlines and constraints and the progressive development of

#

technologies, it is estimated that residual emissions from the transport sector will be more easily abated.

Even in waste management, a share of climate-changing emissions, which cannot be easily reduced, can be expected to persist. In fact, although all the actions mentioned in this document are being introduced, ranging from raising citizens' awareness of more efficient waste collection to the construction of plants for the treatment and energy valorisation of waste, regulatory and administrative obstacles can be as much of a hindrance as a lack of public awareness.

During the drafting of this document, climate adaptation initiatives emerged from the stakeholders involved. The complexity and transversality of the measures made it difficult to obtain estimates in terms of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  reduction, while co-benefits are known due to the reduction of heat waves, better management of heavy rainfall, and reduction of perceived noise, which altogether lead to an improvement in city liveability in the face of an increase in extreme climate phenomena. The table below provides a descriptive account of the ten actions collected, with an associated brief description. Details of the individual actions can be found in Table B-2.2d in the annex.

# 3.3 Module B-3 Monitoring, assessment and learning indicators

This module contains a selection of indicators to evaluate the progress identified in the analysis of the Impact Pathways, highlighting a set of metrics and indicators useful for monitoring over the years the target actions identified by the Municipal Administration as strategic for the development of the city.

The added value of this section is the chance of evaluating the progress of the actions for future years: the reference target values reported for the years 2025 (or alternatively the baseline year available for each indicator), 2027 and 2030 represent an estimate of what it is expected in terms of technological and infrastructural improvements and awareness of the entire city ecosystem towards the issues of climate neutrality.

The baseline column in the table below refers to the reference year in which the indicator is available: for most of them, reference is made to the latest edition of the Urban Ecosystem Questionnaire report of 2024. Any data referring to a different year is indicated with an asterisk (*).

The Municipality of Roma Capitale has been collaborating for several years in the drafting of the 'Ecosistema Urbano' (Urban Ecosystem) study, an annual report produced by Legambiente with the scientific collaboration of Ambiente Italia: the report was the first study in the world to organise the environmental data of cities in order to provide a criterion for assessing sustainability and benchmarking environmental performance. By means of questionnaires and direct interviews with participating municipalities and on the basis of other national statistical sources (e.g. ISTAT), the report defines 125 significant environmental parameters to measure the level of quality of life in capital cities and the effectiveness of initiatives implemented by public administrations. This collection is summarised in 16 indicators covering the six main environmental components present in a city: air, water, waste, mobility, urban environment, energy.

The obstacle that many administrations, including that of the Capitoline city, note is the availability of data. If, on the one hand, these are partially available, given the recent trend that has led public administrations to take an interest in them, yet, on the other, there is a lack of resources and expertise to process them. This is a common problem encountered by many local public bodies in Italy, for which the administration is doing its best to enhance the skills of internal resources through vertical training courses organised in partnership with the city's universities (see Module C of the Action Plan). Moreover, the Administration does not exclude support from external bodies for the collection, mapping and reworking of strategic data for the definition of project performance.

The definition of these indicators is part of a coordinated process that the municipal administration has carried out internally: the involvement of external stakeholders and the open discussions that were organised and supported by AESS during the drafting of the document have made it possible to gather useful feedback that will enrich this version of the document and subsequent ones. The aim is to create specific follow-ups on the monitoring indicators and to keep the workflow tracked and constantly updated over time.

# 4 Part C - Pathway to achieving climate neutrality by 2030

The goal of this section is highlighting the main organizational, social and collaborative governance initiatives that the city is adopting in its neutrality pathway. In the current context, a solid governance for climate policies and an innovative collective engagement at the local level is the prerequisite for effectively tackling climate change. Therefore, these actions are to be considered as directly supporting the climate actions already introduced in Module B.

Before detailing the models and actions for governance and social innovation activated in Rome, we deemed it necessary to show the whole ecosystem in a single scheme:

# Public sector

Roma Capitale
Affiliated/subsidiaries
Municipalities
Other «Mission Cities»
Metropolitan City of Roma
Lazio Region
Italian Government
European Union

# Privat sector

Enterprises and SMEs.
Trade associations
Consultants

Figure 21: Social and governance innovation ecosystem

# University and Research

Universities
Research center

# Civil society

Citizens
Neighborhood committees
Local associations
NGO, voluntary associations, etc.

Roma Capitale committed to creating synergies among local players, by communicating and holding joint discussions on existing and future strategies and specific actions, by keeping the entire urban ecosystem alive. The Transition Team, as described below, plays a fundamental role in this direction as a link among the parties and continuously stimulates the whole territory towards neutrality.

In light of the great success obtained by the joint pathways adopted during the Climate Adaptation Strategy, Roma Capitale selected this as the benchmark methodology to continue promoting citizens' future engagement on climate neutrality.

Despite Roma Capitale's key role, the presence of external stakeholders involved in social and governance innovation pathways proved to be crucial thanks to, on the one hand, the actions undertaken by single stakeholders at the local level - as also reported in the list of behavioural actions contained in the portfolio, and, on the other hand, the various innovation activities implemented by local associations and territorial realities such as Neighbourhood Committees, which are fundamental for a large city such as Rome.

# 4.1 Module C-1 Actions for Governance Innovation

This module describes the innovations Roma Capitale is adopting in terms of governance to achieve the climate neutrality objectives by 2030. Section C-1.1 reports institutional design initiatives, collaboration and awareness-raising processes undertaken by the Municipal Administration as well as by the external stakeholders involved in the Mission and active within the city ecosystem.

By defining the Climate Office at an internal level, since 2021, the city of Rome has adopted a tool which differs from all other local public administrations, thus confirming the city's commitment to cross-sectoral engagement among the city institutions and the main municipal departments. The Climate Office has played a key role in the city's application to the Mission and in the definition of the municipal Working Group, which is part of the Transition Team.

All the activities below (e.g. Agreements, partnerships and memoranda of understanding) always refer, either directly or indirectly, to the Transition Team and, more specifically, to the Climate Office, which, in turn, also serves as an aggregator within the urban ecosystem of social and governance innovation.

The official involvement of external stakeholders was launched in the spring of 2024 through a public Expression of Interest notice with the aim of attracting the largest number of subjects within a context, the Roman one, characterized by complexity and heterogeneity. To take part in the Expression of Interest, the interested parties submitted the required documentation, including the commitment to sign the CCC and the completed forms containing the initiatives and projects they plan to carry out by 2030, reporting the technical and economic data of each single intervention. The procedure collects 80 stakeholders.

Additionally, there are numerous partnerships that the Municipality of Roma Capitale has initiated with research bodies, associations, study centres, financial institutions and sector agencies at a national level to support initiatives aimed at reducing emissions. The effort that the city is making in involving such a large number of partners is to be viewed positively with a view to consolidating and launching new initiatives in the fields of ecological transition, training, and new green technologies.

# C-1.1: Description of the participatory model for climate neutrality

The following governance interventions are rightfully among the actions that directly benefit the achievement of the Mission's objectives: without an extensive and well-designed involvement of the city's ecosystem, the effectiveness of initiatives and investments risks having a more protracted horizon with fewer and less widespread social benefits.

# The Climate Office and the Interdepartmental Working Group

For a more effective implementation of policies to fight climate change, a Climate Office was established in 2021, directly appointed by the Mayor's Cabinet, made up of resources with transversal technical and political-administrative skills. The main functions of the Office are:

coordinating internal municipal activities with regard to the objectives of the 2030 UN Agenda and the European Energy and Climate Plan
defining an organic strategy to fight climate change through the adoption of the Mitigation and Adaptation Plan
supporting the development of energy communities and energy efficiency interventions in buildings.

The involvement of the Mayor's Cabinet demonstrates the high political awareness of the entire municipal administration, which also ensures a cross-sectoral involvement of internal departments
ROMA

demonstrating interdependence with respect to climate objectives. To achieve this, the Office identified a working group consisting of representatives (or their delegates) from the following departments:

Department of Environmental Protection
Department of Heritage and Housing Policies
Department of Infrastructure Development and Urban Maintenance
Department of Major Events, Sport, Tourism and Fashion
Department of Social Policies and Health
Department of Sustainable Mobility and Transport
Department of Urban Planning and Implementation

In the case of topics involving the Administration at an international level, the International Relations Department of the Mayor's Cabinet will also be invited to participate in the Working Group. This is intended to co-ordinate activities in the field of fighting climate change, foster internal debate and allocate resources appropriately with respect to the objectives. In particular, the working group's main areas of action are:

The process of updating the (SECAP), consistent with participation in the Covenant of Mayors, the C40 network and the drafting of the Climate City Contract
the emission monitoring activities foreseen by the municipal commitments undertaken every two years
the participation of the Roma Capitale structures in the working groups envisaged within the C40 and ICLEI membership, as well as in other networks the city has joined
the drafting of the Climate Adaptation strategy
the participation in European calls for tenders and programmes to support interventions and initiatives on the reduction of climate-changing emissions, including the drafting of the CCC
the institutional collaboration with Bodies and Institutions in charge of climate mitigation and adaptation activities
the collaboration with universities and research institutes working on these issues.

The Group's activity will not entail any financial burden as the task undertaken is carried out by its members free of charge.

## The Transition Team

In the CCC's transition context, change management must take place according to a circular and iterative model of sharing and implementation between the actors involved, i.e. public organisations, citizens, the corporate world and research and advisory bodies. The centrality of the Transition Team (TT) in achieving these objectives emerges through three key functions:

the TT as change agent in selecting, involving, facilitating, supporting and training the ecosystem in which the city operates;
the TT as intermediary;
the TT as learning partner promoting knowledge for the local ecosystem.

Among the possible models used to define the TT formulated by NZC, the city of Rome opted for the diffuse participation model in which the TT is the result of a network partnership created by the local actors available without defining an independent external organisation. The actors that constitute the TT play an important role within the territory and aspire to increase their influence: each of them provides resources to organise the neutrality working group, within which a reference figure emerges

as a coordinator of the work. For Roma Capitale, this role is represented by the Climate Office. Since its establishment, this office has dealt with intermediation between public administrative departments and citizen participation in change processes, such as participatory pathways and municipal councils, whose details are provided in the section on social innovation (Module C.2). Research bodies, universities and study centres have been involved on an ongoing basis for some years now, in coordination with the Office and the relevant Departments: evidence of this can be seen in the agreements that Roma Capitale has entered into with the various local and national players in the sector, referred to below in this section. Finally, a further act promoting cross-sectoral involvement of all actors in the area (public bodies, businesses, SMEs, universities, third sector entities, research centres, etc.) was evidenced by the Office's publication of the Expression of Interest in mid-April 2024, the purpose of which was precisely to gather direct and indirect interventions that would contribute to defining the city's decarbonisation project. The response from the urban ecosystem has been encouraging: 80 stakeholders with an overall number of 705 action sheets.

To ensure robust and sustained participation, leveraging incentives such as sharing of resources and best practices, access to strategic data, and increased cross-sectoral competitiveness is important in stakeholder engagement.

Once a broad degree of participation has been achieved, the TT has to keep the networking and transversality of the confrontation continuous, acting within the 'networked' generated context, rather than linearly, helping to broaden the actors involved. It is precisely for this purpose that a day-long urban ecosystem engagement event will be organised for the beginning of 2025, to present the first results of the CCC's journey, keep the ecosystem active and, last but not least, broaden it by starting with new social innovation actions and the strengthening of multi-level governance. The autumn event lays the foundation for the CCC's future steps, and, more importantly, for the continuous co-creation of strategies and the evolution of the portfolio of quantitative, behavioural, social innovation and governance actions.

The role of intermediary within a heterogeneous and articulated ecosystem such as that of the city of Rome is of fundamental importance not only within the CCC definition process but also to establish a long-term governance transition model: this function is carried out by the Climate Office, supported by Net Zero City and by the technical-scientific competences of AESS - Agency for Energy and Sustainable Development, in house fractioned by Roma Capitale, with which the Municipality has worked closely in the path to the realisation of the CCC.

As a learning partner, the TT relied on the NZC platform, which provided online training courses and opportunities to enhance learning directed not only to TT members but also to all stakeholders who signed the plan. Additionally, the numerous collaborative agreements with study centres, agencies and research bodies often guarantee training courses, workshops and round tables for discussion and debate. For further details, please refer to the dedicated section 'Agreements, Partnerships and Protocols'.

# The role of AESS - Agency for Energy and Sustainable Development

The Agency for Energy and Sustainable Development (AESS), a fractional in-house company whose members are public administrations and to which Roma Capitale is a partner, was hired to provide all-round support to the Capitoline CCC. The AESS experts, who support 5 of the 9 Italian mission cities $^{10}$ , carried out intensive work within the TT in strict cooperation with the Climate Office, liaising with the signatory stakeholders to analyse the action sheets, barriers and strategies of the territory and aligning with the NZC advisors (see below) during the course of the CCC.
ROMA

## NZC's support

The advisors of the NZC platform supported Roma Capitale throughout the whole process that led to the drafting of the first CCC. Aided by face-to-face meetings and, especially in the last months of the work, by regular bi-weekly online meetings, the advisors followed the work closely, clearing doubts that arose in the process, and supporting Roma Capitale and AESS on specific topics.

## Roma Capitale's agreements, partnerships and memoranda of understanding with leading local and national actors in the ecological transition

These typologies of agreements represent an opportunity for the city to engage with technically and administratively competent realities in a transversal manner; the positive synergies arising from them can also propagate between the actors involved and other realities in the sector, thus going beyond the mere agreement between two individual actors. Furthermore, a contribution in the training and skills enhancement of the municipality's administrative staff is a co-benefit of the agreements.

## Agreement with the Metropolitan City for the redevelopment and design of new cultural and civic centres

The agreement provides for the design of the 30 cultural and civic centres envisaged under the Integrated Urban Plan (PUI) and financed with NRRP funds for a total amount of around 50 million euro, broken down as follows: the energy efficiency and upgrading of 21 libraries belonging to the Biblioteche di Roma Capitale circuit distributed across several city districts, for an amount of 17.5 million euro, and the construction of 9 new cultural centres for the remainder of the investment. These 30 interventions will be realised by 2026 as they are tied to NRRP funding. This action was the subject of a two-month citizen public consultation, the results of which are analysed in Module C - Social Innovation.

## Collaboration agreement with ENEA for the development of innovative energy technologies

Signed in April 2024, the three-year agreement aims to promote the development of innovative energy technologies, supporting in particular the spread of renewable energy sources and energy communities, the use of hydrogen and innovative solutions for sustainable mobility. The agreement addresses the consolidation and launch of new energy and environmental initiatives to foster the decarbonisation of the energy system, adaptation to climate change, energy end-use efficiency, and the protection of territories and ecosystems. The challenge the city is called to face requires technical and scientific competences that a cutting-edge reality such as ENEA can offer, bridging the gap that often characterises Public Administrations facing the ongoing ecological transition. By means of implementation agreements, the parties will agree on conducting applied research projects or carrying out other initiatives related to scientific and/or training activities to meet the set objectives.

## Memorandum of understanding for the energy requalification of the public building stock with GSE

The objective of the three-year protocol signed in February 2023 is to promote the ecological transition targeting primarily the city's school buildings and then the rest of the public building stock. This main objective is combined with other cross-cutting objectives such as: promoting the production of new energy from renewable sources; encouraging consumption electrification in the city, both through e-mobility solutions and collective energy self-consumption groups, by setting up Renewable Energy Communities; introducing innovative models in the urban waste cycle, such as anaerobic bio-digestion plants for the production of bio-methane and the production of electricity and heat through waste-to-energy plants (both are objectives already envisaged by the Roma Capitale Waste Plan). This agreement is important because it guarantees access to the incentives provided for the energy
ROMA

requalification of municipal buildings (thanks to the Conto Termico - Thermal Account) and the incentives provided for energy communities and anaerobic bio-digestion plants. The outlook, by 2030, is the energy requalification of all Rome's schools, completing the work begun in 2022 on the 212 school facilities financed with the CIS (Institutional Development Contracts) managed by the SIMU Department.

## Agreement with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) for the technical-economic evaluation of strategic projects

In 2023, the two entities signed an advisory agreement to evaluate public-private partnership initiatives in areas fundamental to the city's transformation: in this context, CDP will provide technical and economic-financial advice for projects of great strategic importance that the Municipal Administration intends to implement in partnership with private entities. These include investments in waste recycling, energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, telecommunications systems and urban regeneration. The agreement is valid for 24 months and can be renewed: the parties are currently working to define a detailed programme of activities and their timing.

## Memorandum of understanding for climate risk mapping with CMCC

At the end of 2022, the Administration signed a memorandum of understanding with the Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change (CMCC) to produce a report on climate risk mapping with a 2030-2050 horizon and identify priorities for action, together with activities to support warning systems and communication to the population. In parallel, the plan envisages dissemination and awareness-raising activities on the effects of climate change involving the structures of Roma Capitale and the stakeholders operating on the territory, through in-depth scientific workshops. Using its computing infrastructure, the Centre will work with the city to provide it with an urban resilience model for the benefit of the entire community in the area.

## Memorandum of Understanding with the CNR (National Research Centre), Sapienza University and Link Campus University

The agreement, signed in late 2020, aims to strengthen the path towards innovation in the field of social policies in relation to the changing needs of citizens within a complex and heterogeneous urban context such as Rome. The Administration, supported by other institutions, intends to collect and systematise more data to support services, in order to obtain the most accurate picture possible of the new social situation in the Capital, with the ultimate aim of supporting the design of new and specific modes of intervention.

## Participation in AESS and Collaboration and Support Agreement

Roma Capitale has joined the Agency for Energy and Sustainable Development by Resolution no. 99/2022 of the City Assembly. The agency will assist the city in the areas of energy saving and the promotion of renewable energy sources, climate mitigation, and the construction of the Climate City Contract within the framework of the Mission 100 Neutral Cities. It will also provide specific training within the local administration, courses and workshops on topics relevant to new technologies in the energy field. In addition, an agreement was recently signed to support the establishment of new RECs (Renewable Energy Communities) within the territory. Another core work for the development of strategies related to the greater deployment of renewable energy is the study of the maximum photovoltaic potential that can be installed in the territory, whose results are presented in module B.

# ISPRA Agreement

As part of a groundwater monitoring project in Rome, an agreement was signed with ISPRA in 2020 to systematise data collection and processing on a six-monthly basis. By means of state-of-the-art technical instrumentation, the collected data are processed and entered into a central database thanks to a digital WebGIS application developed by ISPRA. The data can be accessed online.

# Collaboration agreement with CREA

After the cooperation agreement for the identification of 13 suitable areas for urban, peri-urban and extra-urban forestation signed in 2022 with the Metropolitan City of Rome, another agreement followed, involving not only the Metropolitan City but also the Municipality of Rome for a planting project of the identified areas with approximately 250,000 forest plants planted per year. The project invests about 35 million euro by 2022 to promote the recovery of degraded city green areas, fight the heat island phenomenon, and improve the environmental quality of the city. The initiative is entirely subsidised by NRRP funds. CREA's role will be to provide scientific and operational support for the reforestation measures.

# Collaboration agreement with GMATICS

As part of the project to revise the city's master plan in order to adopt structural mitigation and adaptation initiatives and projects in the urbanised areas of the city, the city of Rome took part in the URBANA project as a reference stakeholder, making itself available to share the dataset of information held by the Administration. The focus of the project is to collect geospatial data to support urban planning and green area development, identifying vulnerable urban and peri-urban areas. The company operates within the ESA - European Space Agency network.

# ESA and the Italian Space Agency for Roma Capitale

IRIDE is one of Europe's most important Earth observation satellite space programmes carried out in Italy thanks to NRRP funding. Under the management of ESA and with the support of the Italian Space Agency (ASI), analytical data will be collected to reduce hydrogeological instability and fires, protect the coastline, monitor critical infrastructure, air quality and weather conditions. These data will be made available for the development of commercial applications by start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises and industries, and for the local administrations themselves. Roma Capitale is involved in the project as a partner.

# Agreements with Universities

The collaboration agreement, signed in 2022, seeks to intercept and make the most of the available NRRP resources, involving the best technical and scientific expertise of the capital's university world, including the Universities of La Sapienza, Tor Vergata, Roma Tre, the University of Tuscia and Luiss. The investments in urban regeneration, redevelopment of public real estate, ecological transition and sustainable mobility, digital transition, and social inclusion projects that will take place in the capital are numerous: creating collaborative synergies is an important element to activate and involve the academic world in the Mission's objectives as well. Some detailed agreements with specific universities:11

University of Tuscia: the agreement provides for the possibility of offering new opportunities for promoting scientific knowledge in the territory and among the employees of the Municipality of Rome through the attendance of university courses by employees in service with the Municipality of Rome at special terms; the co-organisation of advanced training courses and educational and seminar initiatives directed at the staff of the Municipality of Rome, also through the involvement of researchers and professors of the University; the performance of research and collaboration activities on topics of common interest, also through the activation of the so-called 'municipal doctorates'; the development of research and collaboration activities on topics of common interest, also through the activation of 'municipal PhDs'; the possibility for Roma Capitale staff with specific professional skills to carry out teaching activities at the University; the participation of staff employed at the University in the training initiatives of the Capitoline Training School. The agreement, which started in 2021-2022, has a duration of three years.

La Sapienza University: In addition to an agreement to provide Capitoline staff with access to the various bachelor's and master's degree courses for training purposes at favourable conditions, La Sapienza University has also taken action with its Department of Political Science, Sociology and Communication to implement projects aimed at the direct involvement of citizens in the monitoring and implementation of local public services and assets. The purpose is to monitor the health of the supply of services through studies, analyses, surveys and traineeships relating to their operation

Roma Tre University: European Hedge IoT project to develop IoT technology solutions able to detect instantaneous production and consumption behaviour and use them in the management of Energy Communities.

## The multi-level governance of Let'sGOv

The participation of Roma Capitale in the Let'sGOv Pilot (GOverning the Transition through pilot actions - Horizon 2020 Grant Agreement programme nr. 101036519) together with the other eight mission cities and the three technical-scientific partners AESS, the University of Bologna and the Energy Centre of Turin, is to be considered as a further action at the level of Innovative Governance thanks to which the twelve partners will work to facilitate climate neutrality in their territories according to three clusters: engagement, data and finance. New governance tools will be defined and tested by the cities within the project. Two twinning cities (Genoa and Issy Les Moulineaux) and several dozen Italian follower cities will have the opportunity not only to apply the guiding tool kits for the energy transition of their territories but also to participate in thematic workshops and training sessions within the project.

The following table shows the details of the main digitisation projects under way in the territory and their respective impacts on the governance of change. The development of digitisation projects is crucial as a means of simplification that fosters change in a more sustainable and inclusive perspective.

# 4.2 Module C-2 Actions for Social Innovation

An efficient climate neutrality path cannot disregard the cross-cutting involvement of the society in which it takes place. The social reality of the city of Rome shows an unequalled complexity for the Italian context: the municipal administration has taken up the challenge, facilitating numerous co-design initiatives that have provided the opportunity to involve stakeholders seen as collateral in the process of designing a new city idea. The instrument of public debate and municipal councils was introduced in local administrations a few years ago, indirectly touching on major infrastructural and architectural works with a significant impact on the environment, cities and spatial planning. Only more recently, a growing interest on the part of citizens and non-economic stakeholders living in the territory, such as associations, non-profit and Third Sector organisations, foundations, and voluntary bodies, have wanted to make their voices heard in view of the growing fears generated by the impact of climate change on people's health and lifestyle.

In an effort to make the document streamlined, in section C-2.1 we chose to focus initially only on the main participatory pathways in the municipality that refer to individual urban regeneration, civic activism or inclusion interventions that occurred between 2022 and 2023. Though small in scale, these interventions are of fundamental importance in terms of training and knowledge enhancement, fostering local civic activism and increasing the awareness of citizens and actors in the area with respect to the territory they inhabit. Moreover, many successful initiatives have been replicated for larger-scale projects, confirming that involvement is a key element of the major transformations the city is undergoing to achieve climate neutrality goals. The following section C-2.2 focuses on larger-scale interventions across the territory of Rome.

While the first year of implementation of the CCC focused on finding a reference methodology for social innovation interventions, the next few years will be devoted to creating more and more synergies between social innovation actors. The diverse realities in the area and already engaged in the path towards neutrality, described below, are to be considered as key enabling actors of many 'micro missions' with specific topics such as food and food waste, green, social and environmental welfare. These additional 'spaces of social innovation and participation' are also to be considered as an important tool to strengthen the continuous involvement of stakeholders, giving them a stronger voice and greater space in the co-creation process.

For these initiatives to have a real impact on the territory, widespread and clear communication is needed: the "Roma si Trasforma" website presented in 2024 fits in as a digital communication infrastructure created to bring together the main interventions managed by Roma Capitale in the themes of innovation, inclusion, sustainability and culture transformation of the city. Constant updates of the initiatives and the possibility of geolocating on the map of Rome the main works in the planning stage, those under construction and those already completed or delivered to the city, make it a usable and all-inclusive tool. Moreover, the platform is an excellent instrument where citizens can monitor public funds, including those deriving from the NRP and the Jubilee, as well as the resources provided by the Capitoline budget and private entities. Therefore, its objective is not only to increase citizens' awareness and responsibility towards the works underway in the city, but also to improve the very liveability of the city: the platform allows for the opening of further planning paths at the level of individual projects and/or specific neighbourhoods.

## C-2.2: Description of Social Innovation actions

## Area-based Social Innovation Interventions

## 15 Municipalities for 15 Projects

The project is part of the 'City of 15 minutes' plan: Risorse per Roma (RpR) (Resources for Rome), in synergy with the Department of Urban Planning and the Department of Decentralisation has identified for each Municipality different areas of urban planning and intervention based not only on what emerged from the various city councils but also from past urban projects and the municipal participatory budget. RpR has drawn up the preliminary design document submitted to the technicians in charge of drafting the master plans, which will be available from March 2023. The city council has already approved 10 of the 15 master plans. Over the coming months, the second phase will begin with the elaboration of the technical-economic feasibility projects (PFTE) of the identified public works and the organisation of participation meetings in the town halls to illustrate the master plans to citizens.

## REC Desk

Following the signing of the memorandum of understanding between the Municipality XIII and Federconsumatori Lazio, the first REC information desk was set up and has been active since June 2023 to provide information, training and advice on the management and design of Renewable Energy Communities to all citizens resident in the Municipality of Rome. The service is delivered by the staff of Federconsumatori Lazio, which has extensive and certified experience in managing RECs technical, legal, regulatory and financial aspects. The service aims to spread awareness of these innovative forms of co-production and encourage the use of renewable natural sources, reducing the phenomenon of energy poverty and fostering social ties in the area. The service is also active via e-mail.

The Municipality I has also opened two desks open to all citizens: one to encourage the creation of RECs, the other called Progeu to support citizens and businesses in accessing EU funds. In their first two months of operation, the desks have captured the attention of a considerable number of organisations operating in the area. The objective of the municipal administration is to diffuse these realities at the municipal level, consistent with the 15-minute city vision, to consolidate proximity services.

# Roma Cura Roma (Rome Heals Rome) Project

The Roma Cura Roma initiative is an appointment instituted and launched by Roma Capitale in 2022 with the involvement of many local partners, including Retake Roma¹², AMA, FAI, Acli, CSV, Plastic Free, and WWF Lazio: the objective is to involve individual citizens, trade associations, schools, municipalities, the public administration, the business world and all the realities of the territory to take care of the common good together by cleaning the city's streets, squares, gardens and parks. Overall, more than 400 actions were carried out in the last edition with about 323 participating associations and over 15,000 citizens involved, showing a great synergy between institutions and participating citizens. Participation in the initiative is free and open to all: the Administration encourages the submission of proposals and initiatives by citizens by filling in a form with the required information on the location, time, and any necessary equipment that will be made available by the Environmental Protection Department and AMA. The project fits coherently within the Regulation for the shared administration of the tangible and intangible commons of Roma Capitale already mentioned in Part A.

# The participatory process for Rome's Climate Adaptation Strategy

At the beginning of 2024, the first phase of public consultation on the proposed Climate Adaptation Strategy of Roma Capitale following its approval by the City Council on 19 January 2024, begun. The strategy was developed around seven training meetings with citizens involving approximately 80-90 citizens each, workshops and interactive focus groups addressed to specific categories selected by the Administration such as workers, ethnic minorities and young people, organised within the framework of the Agora project, and also an e-mail address available to citizens, associations and interest groups where they could send their observations, indications and questions on the strategy. At this stage, the objective was to stimulate public debate and increase awareness and sensitivity on climate change: all citizens could send, until 30 April 2024, observations, proposals, requests for clarifications directly to Roma Capitale, which once discussed will become part of the Strategy itself. The agenda of appointments to discuss the strategy's analyses, priorities and measures in depth is considerable: between February and April, conferences, thematic workshops and discussion tables were organised with the participation of researchers, who worked on the cognitive part of the Strategy, Roma Capitale technicians, associations, interest groups and citizens.

Below is the list of conferences and workshops organised:

Strengthening resilience against heavy rains and floods
Reducing losses, strengthening the recovery and reuse of purified and metered water, ensuring security of supply
Adapting the city to heat waves and rising temperatures
Reducing impacts on the coastline
Rome's economy in a climate change scenario: Impacts on economic and productive systems, inequalities
Biodiversity and protected areas for climate crisis mitigation and adaptation
Rome's historic centre at 40 degrees: challenges for liveability and tourist attractiveness

To ensure participation across all parties, the public consultation process was preceded by mapping the stakeholders potentially interested in the articulated adaptation topics with the aim of informing

¹² Retake Roma is a non-profit foundation active in protecting the environment and caring for the commons, promoting beauty, liveability and urban regeneration. It encourages the dissemination of civic sense and the responsibility of each citizen to contribute to the civil and economic growth of Italy through projects targeting citizens, schools and businesses. At the same time, the association actively participates in the public debate on the sustainable development of cities, the valorisation of public goods, the active involvement of citizens and the efficiency of services.

them of the process and involving them in the meetings. Stakeholders were identified, mapped and prioritised, analysing their influence and interest in the project. In this regard, the research activity addressed associations, committees, companies, representatives of the world of professions, research bodies and universities that have in their statutes or sphere of activity the environment, the territory, the monitoring of water resources and all those aspects related to the causes and effects of climate change on the population. From this analysis, a framework emerged through which resource allocation priorities, communication strategy and project direction could be established through the eyes of the stakeholders.

At the same time, discussion tables were organised with stakeholders to open a debate on analyses and measures, deepen projects and interventions, and involve the various actors in the implementation. The thematic tables will continue beyond the approval of the Adaptation Strategy, touching also on climate mitigation actions in the framework of the implementation of the SECAP and the drafting of this Climate City Contract. The tables have been organised with business organisations, the city agricultural conference, environmental and third sector associations, trade unions, research bodies and universities, and infrastructure, energy and technology network companies. Therefore, the implementation plan of the Strategy is intended to fit in with the CCC's pathway in the definition of working tables and the identification of strategies and priorities by all stakeholders with regard to climate adaptation and mitigation issues.

The participatory pathway is part of the European project AGORA (A Gathering place to cO-design and co-cReate Adaptation), financed under the European Commission's Horizon programme whose main ambition is to promote societal transformation processes in different social, economic and political contexts through cross-disciplinary tools and approaches. AGORA aims to promote best practices, innovative approaches, policy tools and governance mechanisms to meaningfully and effectively engage communities and regions in climate action, accelerating and scaling up the adaptation process to build a climate resilient Europe.

Face-to-face meetings were held to present the strategy and explore the most relevant issues and priorities, and to gather feedback from organised stakeholders and citizens attending the meetings. For this exchange to be effective, the face-to-face meetings were structured in such a way as to give all those present the opportunity to present their ideas and to collect requests and comments in an orderly and comprehensive manner by a facilitator. In addition, the four conferences were video recorded specifically to capture the contributions that emerged in presence at a later stage of elaboration, and the scientific presentations discussed were made available with the aim of increasing the exchange of information.

## The Municipal Councils

Most of Rome's city halls have councils, a consultative body of the municipality established for different purposes according to the needs of the area in which it operates, such as social promotion, integration, territorial protection, and environmental and social volunteering. Hence, they are participation bodies open to all citizens to enhance and promote the participation of free associations and citizens' bodies in the administration through consultation activities. Of particular interest in terms of synergy with the CCC are the councils for young people, schools, the protection of green spaces, social integration and the defence of minorities. Below are the main councils that exist to date and the specific municipalities to which they refer:

City Hall I: council for trade and crafts policies; council for policies in favour of people with disabilities; council for social voluntary work.
ROMA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

City Hall II: council of associations working in the field of the protection of green spaces and urban decorum; council for people with disabilities.
City Hall VII: council for the social integration of foreign citizens; school council
City Hall IX: cultural council; women's council; youth council
City Hall XII: Valle Galeria environmental council

The consultations are established by the municipal council and have a duration established by the same municipal council, which may revise their objectives and aims according to local needs.

## Observatories

These are auxiliary bodies set up by the City Assembly whose aim is to acquire information or make specific assessments on individual problems of collective interest or particular aspects of city life. Given their specificity, they are linked to the city municipalities on the basis of local needs and peculiarities: the results of the observatories' consultations are available for possible projects on a broader city scale. There are two observatories dedicated to the topic of waste: the 'Towards Zero Waste Observatory' of City Hall I and the 'Permanent Waste Observatory' of City Hall VII. The main objectives are to monitor, within the municipal context, the situation of waste and urban decency, make data on the objectives achieved available, collect reports and indications from citizens, and promote the dissemination of environmental culture, reuse and recycling of materials. At the end of 2022, the membership phase of the above-mentioned observatories was completed for the 2021-2025 term of office.

Another observatory is the one linked to the Valle Galeria area, called the 'Participatory Environmental Observatory of the Valle Galeria': it deals with the protection and enhancement of natural resources, environmental quality and the quality of air, water and soil, the dissemination of environmental monitoring data, the promotion of sustainable lifestyles and mobility, water and energy saving in line with the critical issues of the area, which sees the presence of quarries, industries with a high environmental impact (cement factories), gasifiers, landfills and former refineries. The observatory is part of the local policy on the above-mentioned issues, providing the administrative bodies of the Municipality of Rome XII with non-binding proposals and opinions, promoting information, awareness-raising, and training initiatives for citizens, and gathering the requests, opinions, and problems of citizens and representing them to the competent institutions. It consists of a representative for each company whose plants are located and have an environmental and health impact in the Valle Galeria area, i.e. CO.LA.RI. SpA, Raffineria di Roma SpA, ENI SpA, Praoli Oleodotti Italiani SPA, SUDGAS SpA DE.CO. S.C.A.R.L. Municipal Deposit, Lampogas SRL, Terna SpA, Consorzio Malagrotta. Institutional representatives include the Municipality of Rome and the City Hall XI, the Lazio Region, ARPA Lazio and the Azienda USL Roma. On many occasions the Observatory has availed itself of the collaboration, free of charge, of external experts who, with their expertise, can support the Observatory and the City Hall on a technical and scientific level for environmental issues within their competence.

## The Food Council

The objective of the Food Council is to define a Food Plan outlining the agri-food policy of the city of Rome for the coming years, inspired by the principles of circularity and just ecological transition. The constitution of the council represents an opportunity for inclusive participation in which civil society, institutional actors and sector associations meet and dialogue to define the Plan. The participating associations have already been identified through a public call, and the first public meetings began at the end of 2023. The Council will be structured as a city council and will be able to formulate
ROMA

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

O

proposals and opinions in the drafting of the Plan as well as in local food policies, supporting the administration in achieving its objectives.

The work on food policy began in the early months of 2022 and was structured on 7 thematic tables that worked on the different aspects of policies related to the right to access healthy food, school catering and food education, distribution and logistics, the valorisation of territorial supply chains, and the cultural gastronomic promotion of quality.

A great effort has been made on the issue of reducing food waste, one of the fundamental axes of Rome's Food Policy actions, with solidarity initiatives in favour of the underprivileged and by establishing collaboration networks with school canteens, neighbourhood markets and associations engaged in recovering food surpluses. Another important line of work led to Rome's memberships in national associations such as the Oil Cities and Wine Tourism Municipalities and participation in major events such as SlowFood's Salone del Gusto in Turin, the Vinitaly international fair in Verona and the Coldiretti Village at the Circus Maximus.

The first phase of Rome's Food policy path had important milestones with the approval of the regulation of the Food Council by the City Assembly in April 2023 and the official establishment of the Council through a call for tenders in June 2023 to which 147 stakeholders in the agri-food sector adhered: trade associations, business networks.

## Projects to reduce food waste

The 'Stasera offro io' (Tonight It's on Me) initiative promotes the fight against food waste through a dedicated app: the project was defined following a two-year agreement between Roma Capitale and the Associazione Banco Alimentare Roma and involves all the city halls. The project involves private operators of the food system (bakeries, delicatessens, supermarkets, markets, bars, restaurants, canteens, food industries) for free redistribution projects of surpluses.

The 'Tenga il resto' (Keep the Rest) project also promotes good practices for the recovery of uneaten food to reduce food waste through the distribution to restaurants of a special aluminium tray with which customers can take home uneaten food, preventing it from being wasted. The project is promoted by the Waste Cycle Department with the support of Consorzio Nazionale Imballaggi Alluminio - CIAL, which has made 300,000 trays available to participating restaurants. Other participating associations include the Federazione Pubblici Esercizi di Roma e Provincia, the Federazione Italiana Esercenti Pubblici e Turistici di Roma e Lazio and Slow Food Italia.

## The Participatory Balance Sheet

The Participatory Balance Sheet represents a concrete example of how citizens can have an active and central role in the decisions that affect their city, contributing directly to the definition of priorities and allocation of resources. The questionnaire, available online, collects impressions, ideas and suggestions from citizens to take stock of what has been done in the past and plan the future together. The survey is part of the research project coordinated by the Department of Business Administration of the University of Roma Tre 'How to transform participatory budgeting into an effective and lasting practice of good governance?'. This experience, financed by NRRP funds, builds on the previous experience that took place from June to October 2019 in which, after an information phase to citizens through various communication channels, citizens' proposals were presented and subsequently assessed by the Administration's technical table in their technical and financial feasibility. The approved proposals were subjected to a final online vote by citizens, who were able to express a maximum of three preferences. As a result of the vote, municipal rankings were approved, from which

the projects admitted to funding were identified until the budget was fully allocated. A total of 65 proposals were accepted for funding and included in Roma Capitale's economic planning documents.

# Neighbourhood Committees

# Roma Technopole

As a result of Roma Capitale's concession, free of charge, of an area of approximately 7,500 square metres, the first phase of the realisation of the technological pole overseen by the Rome Technopole Foundation has begun. The project brings together 7 universities in the region, 4 public research organisations, as well as Unindustria, the Lazio Region, the Municipality of Rome, the Chambers of Commerce of Rome, Latina-Frosinone, and Rieti-Viterbo, and some 20 industrial groups and enterprises. It aims to create an innovation ecosystem thanks to the funding provided by the MUR under the NRRP to feed the research, training, and innovation chain in the three main areas of interest: energy transition, digital transition, and health and biopharma. All the buildings will be constructed using the most advanced technological solutions, self-sufficient in terms of energy, based on the circularity of resources and capable of generating clean energy through the installation of photovoltaic systems, innovative hydrogen systems and the use of geothermal sources.

# Rome Energy Desk for citizens

Ufficio Scopo Clima has recently launched a tender for the launch of the online energy desk 'Roma Sportello Energia per i cittadini' which will be active from January 2025 through a dedicated website that will act as an information hub and interactive tool for citizenship containing all the information material to be made available to citizens. The site will also include a FAQ area, direct access to the online help desk (which will guarantee telematic support and continuous assistance to users through online forms and dedicated e-mails) and popular multimedia content (infographics, brochures, video pills) to simplify the understanding of certain topics and to be used and disseminated by both citizens and the staff of the Capitoline Municipalities.

The online Help Desk Service will guarantee telematic support and continuous assistance to users through online forms and dedicated e-mails for 24 months. The site will also contain informative material (infographics, brochures, video clips) to simplify the understanding of certain issues and to be used and disseminated by both citizens and the staff of the Capitoline Municipalities.

During 2025, thematic webinars will also be organised on the main topics (energy communities, bill reading, energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, etc.), which will be detailed according to the main themes that emerge during the help desk activity.

For the purpose of enabling an autonomous management by the Capitoline administration of the online help desk and the continuation of the project, an ad hoc training course will be developed for the Capitoline staff.

The Energy Desk has the following objectives

Awareness-raising and information on domestic energy consumption and savings, support in reading energy bills and identification of opportunities for savings and optimisation in terms of efficiency and costs;
Information and support on available renewable energy consumption and/or production options;
Information on facilitations and contributions for reducing energy expenditure such as 'home bonus', 'Ecobonus', 'Superbonus' incentives, home appliance bonus, contributions on renewable energy sources.

The Energy Desk will also have the objective of promoting Renewable Energy Communities (e.g. information on the concept of renewable energy community and other configurations of widespread self-consumption and associated benefits), also by networking existing territorial realities.

By 2025, the activation of a travelling one-stop shop is planned, which will tour the main squares of each municipality during the year, with the aim of promoting awareness and reaching out to all citizens, but also strengthening the link between the local community and the administration, promoting constructive collaboration to address the energy challenges of the territory.

# ECT - Enabling City Transformation

The Net Zero District NZD project is related to a NZC call, presented by 4 out of 9 Italian cities involved in the Mission (Parma, Prato, Bergamo and Rome) with the technical and scientific support of AESS. The goal of the project is to bring forward the potential innovation in energy and water management into districts to strengthen competitiveness. To reach this goal, part of the financial sources will be required by the stakeholders' engagement into the Tiburtina area, the area under study by the Municipality of Rome. Some of them have been already involved through the CCC (Acea ATO2, Terna, RFI, Leonardo, BASF, Gentilini, Centro Agro-alimentare Romano, ARETI) and others will be. According to the timeframe, the project should start in April 2025 and will last 18 months. The contract is about to be signed. One of the cores aims of NZD is to strengthen collaborative relationships between public and private sector. A direct and expected outcome of the project is building co-designing solutions within the industrial sector for sustainable energy and water management at the district level.

# 5 Scenarios and Next Steps

## Strategy for the next CCC and future scenarios

Decarbonisation will accompany the city's work over the next few years, through periodic verification of results, monitoring of emissions, updating and integration of actions on the basis of new opportunities that may open up to accompany the emission reduction trajectory.

In particular, the phase of study and in-depth analysis of possible intervention scenarios and their results does not end with the approval of the Climate City Contract. In the coming years, it will indeed be necessary to deepen possible intervention scenarios and partnership models for financing to overcome the financing barriers of the planned interventions. Moreover, simulations of the impact that the dissemination of certain technologies could have in strategic sectors, such as construction and production from renewable sources, mobility, management of the electricity distribution network and storage systems, and the possible contribution of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ eq absorption from forestation measures, will be indispensable.

A priority will also be to continue the work started with the city's stakeholders. To accompany and support the choices made and the planned mitigation and adaptation actions, to broaden participation to other economic, industrial and social actors. The discussion on the strategies and actions envisaged by the Climate City Contract will be organised in working groups and will allow the feasibility to be verified and proposals to be accepted, and opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the envisaged policies to be explored in the various areas and sectors. The processes of stakeholder engagement started by Roma Capitale for the Climate Adaptation Strategy and the Climate City Contract will be increasingly cross-referenced and intertwined, due to the added value that an integrated approach can bring in addressing the problems and needs of neighbourhoods where the impact of heat waves and flooding is getting more and more relevant, involving and sharing with the city's actors the path undertaken and improving its effectiveness.

## 1 Climate Governance Innovation

Climate neutrality is a goal that involves every sector of the administration and every programming and planning tool and influences institutional governance with the relationship with municipal territorial structures, European, national and regional institutions, the Metropolitan City, and the relationship with stakeholders. Collaboration between structures and bodies, commitment to shared objectives, willingness to discuss choices with all economic and social actors, and continuous and transparent monitoring of results are all decisive factors for effective governance and the achievement of climate neutrality targets. Work will be carried out on this point, reaffirming the central role of the Climate Office and the whole Transition Team in a co-designing and listening logic established at the beginning of the pathway to neutrality.

## 2 Integrated Approach to Climate Mitigation and Adaptation Policies

The climate crisis acceleration is manifesting its effects in Rome, as in every part of the world, with increasingly evident economic, social and health consequences. The Adaptation Strategy approved by Roma Capitale highlights the growing risks and impacts in a 2050 scenario, with priorities for action. Climate neutrality policies must overlap with adaptation policies as the two issues are now inextricably intertwined where action is taken in neighbourhoods, on energy and infrastructure networks, and water. Thus, an integrated approach achieves more effective results.

# 3 An Inclusive Transformation of the City

The transition to a zero-emission energy model must concern all citizens and every part of the city. Transformation projects of neighbourhoods and buildings, public spaces and infrastructures for the climate transition must place people and communities at the centre, starting with the most fragile segments. After all, implementing interventions that reduce energy expenditure and creating opportunities to move sustainably, bringing quality projects, investments and activities is necessary and most urgent among fragile communities, and it also creates the greatest benefits. An inclusive approach in which no one is left behind is the most effective in forging acceptance of the energy transition, making people understand its economic and social as well as environmental benefits. The methodology used for citizen pathways during the drafting and sharing of the Adaptation Strategy has become the Roma Capitale chosen methodology to implement present and future social innovation and governance pathways also within the CCC. Its application will ensure the city's ongoing inclusion in the pathway to 2030 neutrality.

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

#

# 1 Introduction

The priority of Rome's commitment to climate is due to the crisis acceleration and the increasing devastating social and environmental consequences worldwide, as well as in the willingness to make the climate a transversal key for urban policy innovation to tackle the challenges that the city is called to face.

Participation in the EU Mission Climate neutral and smart cities represents a great opportunity to effectively programme choices in the direction of an ambitious city trajectory towards climate neutrality and make it a shared goal for all city actors.

The city's two key words in its ongoing climate work are vision and concreteness. Two new instruments defining the city's climate action priorities - the Climate City Contract, as far as mitigation is concerned, and the Roma Capitale Climate Adaptation Strategy - identify the actions already underway and those to be undertaken, as well as the barriers to be overcome and the opportunities that can be created. Hence, the most effective solutions to help families and businesses reduce their energy expenditure thanks to competitive and accessible alternatives for all citizens.

The aim is to transform Rome into an energy transition laboratory where, thanks to the projects spread throughout the city, the city meets the challenges of liveability, strengthening industrial innovation and local economy, reducing inequalities and improving urban regeneration, creating new cultural activities and opportunities for all.

Rome is a city where emissions are reducing. Analyses carried out as part of the SECAP pathway show a steady decline since the beginning of the new century, with a  $35\%$  drop compared to 2003 and an  $11\%$  drop to 2015, from 12.905 million in 2003 to 8.411 million tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  in 2019. Per capita emissions stand at 2.9 tonnes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  in 2019, whereas they were 4.9 tonnes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  in 2003. The new methodology introduced by JRC for the Mission also asks cities to consider the additional sectors of AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) and IPPU (Industrial Processes and Product Use) and to use a slightly different emission factor. This brings the value of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  emissions in 2019 to 8.598 million tonnes, and per-capita emissions to 3.0 tonnes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$ .

A gradual reduction in emissions has taken place in all sectors in recent years, with the percentage distribution between sources remaining essentially constant over the years, and almost  $94\%$  of emissions related to building and transport consumption.

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

The reduction in emissions achieved in recent years is largely explained by technological improvements. In particular, the renewal of the vehicle fleet has led to an improved efficiency of combustion processes, while in building heating, the gradual replacement of the most polluting boilers with more technologically advanced systems and the thermal insulation and energy efficiency of the building stock have reduced emissions. On the other hand, the increased use of renewable energy sources in the energy mix has had an effect on reducing emission factors related to electricity consumption. In addition, the switching of a large part of the lighting to LED lamps has reduced emissions from public lighting.

Roma Capitale seeks to contribute to the global climate commitment through strengthened collaboration with European and international cities to stop the climate crisis. In 2005, the Municipality joined the C40 network of the world's large cities that agree on accelerating actions to stop climate change and, in 2009, the Covenant of Mayors. In 2013, it approved the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). That same year, it joined the '100 Resilient Cities' initiative and, in 2021, the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), which was last updated in the Climate Plan approved in 2023.

Figure 2. Roma Capitale's climate commitment

In 2023, Rome approved the update of the SECAP, as requested by the C40 Network to contribute to the global temperature containment target of 1.5 degrees. The 'Deadline 2020' programme has developed targets for different large cities around the world, with different goals depending on economic and geographic parameters. For Rome, the planned targets are higher than the reduction set by the SECAP in 2021. The new Plan, approved in November 2023 by the City Assembly, envisages a committed emission reduction target of  $-66\%$  in 2030 compared to 2003, surpassing the  $-51.6\%$  forecast in the plan approved in 2021.

The carbon neutrality target set by the '100 carbon-neutral and smart cities by 2030' Mission requires us to raise the level of ambition and create a coherent framework of urban policies with governance and long-term monitoring of results, based on a process of discussion and sharing with the city and stakeholder involvement.

The first choice to respond to this challenge was to create a new Climate Office, in the Mayor's Cabinet, with the task of coordinating the city's adaptation and mitigation policies. An internal working group within the administration, coordinated by the Climate Office, was created to ensure strong involvement and streamlining of all departments and councillorships whilst strengthening the scientific support of national research institutes and universities to the process.

The Climate City Contract is part of a path of urban policies that have had a strong acceleration towards climate neutrality in recent years, with a cross-sectoral vision covering the different sectors of the administration and which is in line with the instruments approved: Waste Plan, Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility, Climate Adaptation Strategy. These newly drafted instruments are one of the building blocks of the CCC and their implementation and results verification, updating of measures will be crucial for the work effectiveness and policy integration. In addition, the CCC drafting saw the involvement of the city's economic, social and institutional actors with respect to the ongoing and planned decarbonisation choices so that they could be integrated within a vision and share the work path for the coming years.

With the Climate City Contract the city defines a consistent decarbonisation strategy. To Rome, the work of the CCC represented a chance for a clearer identification of objectives and priorities in the direction of decarbonisation, a more effective organisation of necessary actions and investments, barriers and opportunities through discussions with stakeholders. As a starting point, emissions were updated according to the parameters defined by the Mission, which partly differ from those of the Covenant of Mayors used for the SECAP.  $94\%$  of the municipality's emissions come from the buildings and transport sectors, with  $60\%$  and  $34\%$  respectively, the remainder being split between waste  $(5\%)$ , industrial processes (IPPU) and agriculture (AFOLU). The graph highlights the breakdown of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{eq}$  emissions by sector in 2019, the year chosen as the baseline for pre-pandemic homogeneous data.

# 3 Climate neutrality actions and investments

The structure of the emission reduction scenario in Rome took the emissions baseline in the year 2019 as a reference and, through a process of co-creation which involved the various departments of the administration and stakeholders, traced the articulated portfolio of interventions carried out since the baseline year, those in progress and those planned with funding from Roma Capitale and stakeholders.

Rome is currently undergoing unprecedented investments in the direction of the overall decarbonisation and redevelopment of the city that will have a structural impact on the reduction of emissions related to the consumption of buildings, mobility, and waste management, with actions that will result in far-reaching innovation in the various sectors, made possible by the resources allocated through the Recovery Plan, those related to the organisation of the 2025 Jubilee of the Catholic Church, European, national, and regional funding, the administration's budget, and public-private partnerships.

Figure 6. Cumulative trend in installed photovoltaic power in Rome (MWp) (Source: GSE)

As far as renewable energy sources are concerned, the growth in the installation of solar photovoltaic plants continues - at the end of 2023, 21,846 plants were installed in the Municipality of Rome for a power of more than 230 MW and a strong acceleration of installations in recent years -, in addition, the city can count on the contribution of hydroelectric plants, such as the barrage on the Tiber River at Castel Giubileo, with an installed power of 17 MW, as well as smaller plants installed on the aqueduct network. As far as buildings owned by the municipal administration are concerned, a total of 1.92 MW

of photovoltaic systems are currently installed on schools, offices and other facilities, for a total of 163 buildings. Projects underway thanks to the contribution of the NRP and European, regional and national resources will allow 10 MW to be installed by 2026, to which will be added Project Financing projects proposed by private actors on Roma Capitale facilities.

In Rome in recent years, several energy requalification interventions of private residential buildings have been carried out that have had access to state tax deductions. A specific study, carried out for the Climate City Contract by Enea, estimates that with the Superbonus incentive, energy requalification interventions have been carried out in the period 2021-2024 on 6,896 buildings, of which 2,522 condominiums, for a total investment of approximately EUR 3.55 billion and a reduction of at least two energy classes. In addition, 8,158 photovoltaic systems were installed as part of the Superbonus incentive, with a total capacity of 51.2 MWp. As far as the Ecobonus incentive is concerned, ENEA's estimate refers to about 156,700 energy efficiency interventions carried out in the 2020-2023 period, equal to over EUR 1.1 billion. Moreover, about 150 schools, and over 1,000 public social housing units, libraries, theatres, and museums are undergoing energy requalification interventions with resources from the Recovery Plan, state, regional, and municipal funds.

In the area of mobility, interventions to strengthen the public transport offer and zero-emission mobility systems are underway or planned with access to specific financing for a total of EUR 9.18 billion. In particular, plans include the expansion of the metro and tram network and the gradual electrification of road transport, through funding for the completion of the Metro C line (the new Porta Metronia and Colosseo stations will be opened in 2025, and the extension to Farnesina is being financed), the construction of four new tram lines (Palmiro Togliatti, Verano-Stazione Tiburtina, Termini-Vatican-Aurelio, Roma Termini-Tor Vergata, for a total of 32 kilometres), the purchase of 411 electric buses, 110 hybrids, 244 methane-powered buses, 121 tram trains, and 40 metro trains. In addition, construction sites are underway for the realisation of 130 new kilometres of bicycle paths, which will expand on the existing 320 kilometres. To curb atmospheric pollution and car circulation, the city has approved a 'Green Area' limited traffic zone, with restrictions on the circulation of the most polluting vehicles, to be monitored through an electronic system with video cameras at 154 entrances and verification of vehicle pollution classes. RFI is in the process of upgrading stations and programmes on the Rome railway node, some of which are of great importance, such as the closure of the railway ring, the construction of the new Pigneto station and interchange node, and the upgrading of railway lines used by commuters. In addition, substantial infrastructural upgrading and the purchase of trains are planned on the two Rome-Ostia Lido and Rome-Viterbo urban railway lines managed by ASTRAL and owned by the Region.

Rome's urban upgrading and suburbs regeneration will allow to reduce energy consumption in residential units and climate-altering emissions and increase the quality and identity of urban spaces through functions and services. Some of the city's suburbs (Corviale, Tor Bella Monaca, Santa Maria della Pietà) affected by major degradation are being addressed through Recovery Plan resources, to achieve a significant reduction in energy consumption by installing photovoltaic solar systems, creating energy communities, and upgrading social and cultural spaces. In addition, interventions are being carried out in each of the city's districts to redesign neighbourhoods on the basis of the '15-minute city' concept, so that all services essential for a good quality of life are within a 15-minute walking distance from one's home.

In the waste sector, a radical transformation of the waste management system is taking place toward greater and more capillary differentiated waste collection, higher and higher valorisation of waste, through recovery and reuse, and by building the necessary facilities within the municipal territory. Among the interventions currently being implemented in the Municipality territory are two anaerobic bio-digestion plants with an annual capacity of 100 thousand tonnes for the organic waste fraction to produce bio-methane and digestate; two plants with an annual capacity of 100 thousand tonnes each for sorting paper and cardboard and plastic; 30 collection centres distributed in the various districts; a 600 thousand tonne/year waste-to-energy plant for treating the unsorted waste fraction with electricity and heat

production, and a plant for the recovery and recycling of ash for the production of building materials, and a pilot project for  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  capture and storage. The two bio-digestion plants referred to above will allow AMA (the waste collection and management company of Roma Capitale) to entirely replace diesel with bio-methane. The final design of a bio-gas plant to be realised by 2030 in the former Malagrotta landfill was also approved.

To upgrade electricity grids and get them ready for the new climate scenario, investments are being made by electricity distribution and transmission grid operators. ARETI's business plan envisages investments of EUR 2.3 billion to strengthen the resilience of the distribution grid to the new climate change mitigation and adaptation scenario. Terna plans interventions to increase the efficiency and safety of the service through the construction of new power lines, the burying of some existing ones in urban areas, and the decommissioning of obsolete ones, with investments of approximately EUR 500 million to reorganise the Capital's electricity grid.

Moreover, the stakeholder engagement process allowed us to map the 493 actions of the city's stakeholders carried out since 2019, in progress or planned, excluding those financed with funds already included in Table 1, and estimate a total investment value of approximately EUR 1.983 billion.

# 4 The Climate City Contract's 2030 decarbonisation target

To achieve the 2030 target, an articulated framework of actions and strategies has been identified to accelerate the path to climate neutrality in different sectors. The scope of the Climate City Contract is comprised of the entire territory of Roma Capitale, with the exclusion of the Vatican City, and takes into consideration all sectors, as per the city's application to the Mission. Rome is the largest of all Italian municipalities (1,287 square kilometres) and the one with the largest population (over 2.8 million inhabitants).

The graph shows the different levers foreseen to achieve climate neutrality: interventions envisaged by sector plans and the Climate City Contract, innovation in governance, revision of the regulatory framework, new intervention models with the involvement of public and private resources, stakeholder involvement and citizen participation.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 7. Emission reduction contributions by type of action and strategy

The Climate City Contract's work has shown that Rome has the potential to move from 8.598 million tCO2eq emissions in 2019 to 1.798 million tCO2eq in 2030, with a reduction in per capita emissions from 3.0 tCO2eq/inhabitant to 0.63 tCO2eq/inhabitant. The graph is designed considering the achieved results from 2019 in terms of emission reductions, and those that can be achieved with the actions underway and foreseen by the different plans in force, those foreseen by the stakeholders involved in the CCC, and the behavioural ones. The strategies of the Climate City Contract, i.e. the new intervention models in the different sectors and the actions to be financed, are broken down into two categories. The first

one with the strategies in line with the work of the SECAP 2023, integrated with the new actions and the acceleration of processes in the different sectors. The second one considers building a more ambitious decarbonisation path shared between the different government levels to accelerate investments and actions in Rome, which would bring the reduction to  $-79.1\%$  compared to 2019 emissions and  $-86\%$  compared to 2003. As envisaged by Net Zero City, an estimated  $20\%$  of residual emissions in the path to climate neutrality are estimated in 'hard to abate' areas, i.e. where zero emissions are difficult to achieve with today's technologies, for example: in a part of the built-up area, where the elimination of gas systems is more complex and costly (especially in historical buildings), in a portion of the private vehicle fleet and for commercial use, in some production processes and waste management. In fact, the calculations only consider types of intervention and technologies that are widespread and available, while the possibility of including the contribution that may come from the drive for innovation and experimentation that will be triggered by European climate policies, the international research and development context and competition on green products is postponed to the periodic monitoring and updating of the CCC.

The methodology proposed by Net Zero City made it possible to analyse the different actions in terms of co-benefits generated and link them with one or more systemic levers, which are gathered in figure 8 and table 3.

# 5 Strategic Priorities

The decarbonisation process affects multiple aspects of the city organisation and activities. For its acceleration, the Climate City Contract identifies a number of strategic priorities capable of influencing the direction of climate neutrality and innovating specific sectors, while at the same time producing transversal results ranging from the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution to the increased liveability of urban spaces and generating positive spillovers in terms of industrial innovations and the creation of new activities, jobs and opportunities. The Rome Climate City Contract strategies cover seven priority areas.

# 5.1 Growth in renewable energy production

The strategy to 2030 aims at a strong growth in the installation of solar photovoltaic systems, favoured by the great potential of the Roma Capitale territory, as regards both irradiation and the availability of covered areas, of parking areas where photovoltaic shelters can be realised, and for an extensive farmland, where it is possible to integrate agrivoltaic systems. The goal is to valorise the different configurations of installations that are competitive today: in self-consumption to serve activities and households, for sale to the grid or (for large plants) through Power Purchase Agreement models; in shared energy configurations, such as Energy Communities (with respect to which a specific regulation has been approved for promotion) and Collective Self-consumption. In 2024, Roma Capitale approved a regulation for the creation of Solidarity Energy Communities on plants and roofs owned by the Municipality for Third Sector entities and a simplification for the installation of solar energy on roofs in the Technical Implementation Regulations of the Town Planning Regulations. Roma Capitale is preparing an amendment to the urban planning regulations to clarify and simplify the installation of roof-top solar systems.

A specific study, prepared for the Climate City Contract by AESS, identified the potential of solar photovoltaic systems that could be installed in the territory of the Municipality of Rome. In particular, the study considered installations on the roofs of civil and industrial buildings, roof-mounted systems covering the largest parking areas and agrivoltaic projects that could be implemented in some agricultural areas of the city. The estimated potential for roof-mounted photovoltaic installation on buildings is about 3.4 GW, while in the case of roof-mounted photovoltaic potential on the cover of the largest car parks, the study reported a cumulative installable power of approximately 101 MWp. Finally, the installation of agrivoltaic plants in agricultural areas of the municipality was assessed, for a total power of about 1 GW.

The study used a precautionary approach, which excludes the installation of plants within the UNESCO Perimeter and, to a limited extent, in the buildings of the areas included in the Quality Charter. Moreover, it only accounts for the most extensive parking areas and considers a maximum of $1.2\%$ of Rome's area occupied by agrivoltaic plants.

# 5.2 Residential building efficiency and electrification of thermal systems

The 2030 strategy for the decarbonisation of buildings focuses on different and integrated interventions concerning: the efficiency of building envelopes, the electrification of heating systems, the implementation of energy consumption management systems, and the installation of renewable energy systems. These processes, now underway for some time and increasingly widespread, will play a strategic role given that the largest share of the capital's emissions comes from this sector. The emission reduction estimate elaborated with the CCC took into account the electrification of heating and hot water production systems, with the exclusion of the historic building stock and part of the condos, and a share of about 20% of overall energy redevelopment of buildings, using as parameters the savings quantified by Enea in the Superbonus interventions.

The objective is to ensure NZEB (Near Zero Energy building) or ZEB (Zero energy building) performance in urban regeneration processes, pursuant to the new European Directive on Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EPBD), while at the same time accelerating the energy redevelopment of public and private building stock, with well-defined performance targets to be achieved in reducing consumption and emissions. The Municipality's Building Regulations are being revised to accelerate and incentivise climate mitigation and adaptation measures. The aim is to progressively eliminate the use of fossil fuels for domestic heating (starting with the most energy-intensive buildings and where it is technically feasible), replacing them with integrated systems consisting of heat pumps or other efficient heating systems, low-enthalpy geothermal systems and photovoltaic systems for self-consumption or within energy communities.

As far as the buildings owned by Roma Capitale are concerned, the objective is to achieve the progressive decarbonisation of the entire heritage, using intervention models involving public-private partnerships for the implementation of energy upgrading and management through EPCs (Energy Performance Contracts), the electrification of heating systems, self-production through photovoltaic systems integrated, wherever possible, with geothermal systems, and the purchase of electricity from renewable sources with a guarantee of origin.

As regards, on the other hand, the energy efficiency of buildings in the tertiary sector and industrial plants, an estimate was made starting from the forecasts of changes in energy consumption to 2030 reported in the Lazio Regional Energy Plan.

# 5.2 Integrated and zero-emission mobility

The strategy to 2030 focuses on an increasingly integrated, electric, sustainable mobility offer, furthering the direction set by the PUMS (the Urban Sustainable Mobility Plan approved in 2022), which envisages strengthening the public rail transport system through planned interventions (the construction of the D line the technological upgrading and extension of the A and B lines, the construction of 7 new tram lines for a total of 37.5 kilometres), the progressive electrification of all public road transport and the use of zero-emission systems, the extension of the network of cycle paths, pedestrian areas and 30 kilometre per hour zones. The city sharing mobility offer of bicycles, scooters, electric cars, the presence of charging stations for electric vehicles and the integrated mobility offer through the digitisation of data related to the different transportation means, as envisaged by the MaaS project, will be extended to the entire inhabited area. The strategies also considered the contribution to reducing emissions linked to the increase in registrations of zero-emission vehicles (Battery Electric Vehicles) or near-zero-emission vehicles (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles), with a penetration of electric vehicles of around 17% for passenger cars and 10% for commercial vehicles, based on the PNIEC 2024 estimates, and that linked to smart working.

# 5.3 Power grid adaptation and resilience

A priority strategy to enable climate neutrality concerns the retrofitting of the electricity grid to new adaptation and mitigation scenarios. In fact, on the one hand there is an increase in the frequency and intensity of the impacts of heat waves and heavy rainfall on the grid and the risk of blackouts. Yet, on the other hand, the progressive electrification of building and vehicle heating systems will lead to an increased demand for energy from the grid and flexibility, as the deployment of renewable energy plants and storage systems increases. To this end, Areti's business plan envisages strengthening its resilience with investments in the electricity distribution network, the installation of storage systems and the replacement of ageing lines.

# 5.4 Energy and social regeneration of urban areas

The Climate City Contract is intended to pursue the ongoing process of urban regeneration made possible by Recovery Plan resources, with the aim of reducing energy consumption in homes and climate-changing emissions, increasing the quality and identity of urban spaces, the presence of services for citizens and social and cultural activities, working from the suburbs that are most prone to social and environmental problems, with the goal of tackling growing energy poverty. The aim is to pursue these projects in neighbourhoods based on the concept of the '15-minute city' concept, so that all services essential for a good quality of life are located close to homes. The focus on the quality of public spaces and their liveability will be linked to the goal of climate adaptation of public spaces and housing, rethinking them to reduce the impact of heat waves and extreme phenomena on people's lives, enhancing the presence of green spaces, water, materials with a greater albedo effect, and improving the management of rainwater to enhance its recovery and reuse, while reducing the impact of heavy rains. These interventions in peripheral urban areas are intended to demonstrate that climate transition can change life for the better for all citizens in every neighbourhood.

# 5.5 Sustainable waste and material management

The Climate City Contract aims to strengthen and complete the full redesign of the waste management system put in place in recent years, to overcome a system that strongly affects air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, as it hinges on the transport of all categories of waste outside the municipality, leaving no plant capacity within the municipality. The goal is to give continuity to the interventions currently underway, with a strategy to 2030 that focuses on strongly reducing the production of the unsorted fraction - through industrial agreements, eco-design, information campaigns directed at citizens - and pushing for recovery on an increasingly articulated range of reuse and recycling supply chains, to be directed towards plants which will be built and integrated in the metropolitan area's production districts. The municipal administration and the system of participated companies will adopt Green Public Procurement models for all tenders with criteria that privilege materials from recovery, reuse and recycling. With the planned increase in separate waste collection in the coming years, a further increase in the amount of organic waste to be treated can be expected, and so the possibility of building more bio-methane plants.

# 5.6 Green Procurement

A further strategy implemented in the Climate City Contract concerns green energy and green public procurement. The dialogue process with stakeholders made it possible to highlight the many actions planned to purchase green energy with a Guarantee of Origin to cover part of the electricity consumption of the tertiary sector and companies. The intention is to support this path on the part of companies and the public administration, with Roma Capitale's commitment to expand the minimum environmental

# 6 Principles at the heart of the path to climate neutrality

## 6.1 Climate Governance Innovation

Climate neutrality is a goal that engages every sector of the administration across the board and affects every programming and planning tool, as well as the relationship with European, national and regional institutions, with the Metropolitan City and municipal structures, and with stakeholders. The collaboration between the structures of the Municipality, the Metropolitan City, the Region and the Ministries, that with the various bodies involved in the process, the identification of shared objectives and courses of action, the comparison of choices with all economic and social actors, and the continuous and transparent monitoring of results all represent decisive factors for effective governance and the achievement of climate neutrality targets. Work will be carried out on this point, reaffirming the central role of the Climate Office and the Transition Team in a co-designing and listening logic established at the beginning of the pathway to neutrality.

## 6.2 Integrated Approach to Climate Mitigation and Adaptation Policies

The climate crisis acceleration is manifesting its effects in Rome, as in every part of the world, with increasingly evident economic, social and health consequences. The Adaptation Strategy approved by Roma Capitale following a process of stakeholder engagement highlights the growing risks and impacts in a 2050 scenario, identifying priorities for action and measures. Within urban areas, only an integrated approach to climate adaptation and mitigation can address complex problems and achieve co-benefits from interventions. In neighbourhoods, this includes integrated design to reduce the impact of heat waves, enhancing the contribution of greenery, water, shade and wind to the microclimate and thus reducing cooling needs. In strengthening the resilience of energy, rail, road and water networks that are indispensable for both adaptation and climate mitigation. In urban forestation processes, where the city's plan to plant more than 650,000 trees by 2026 and to reach one million by 2030, it aims to produce results in terms of reducing heat in the city and capturing  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  through careful selection of the areas where the urban heat island effect is most significant, planting the most suitable species and also increasing shading. In the production districts, starting with those of Santa Palomba and the Tiburtina Valley, the aim is to promote, in cooperation with the business system, innovation in the management of energy and water networks, reduction of consumption, self-production of energy from renewable sources, efficiency and integration of management systems, recovery and reuse of natural resources. In strengthening the agricultural system in a city unique in Europe where half of the land is cultivated, the aim is to push for crops and management models capable of adapting the land to scenarios of prolonged heat waves and drought, and of recovering and reusing meteoric water, but also to promote the spread of renewables and their careful integration to support farms and the network of urban gardens.

## 6.3 An Inclusive Transformation of the City

The transition to a zero-emission energy model must concern all citizens and every part of the city. For this reason, transformation projects of neighbourhoods and buildings, public spaces and infrastructures for the climate transition will place people and communities at the centre, starting with the most fragile segments. Rome is a city with a huge territory but with a strong neighbourhood dimension, with a widespread fabric of associations and a protagonist of multiple cultural and social activities, which

manage green and cultural spaces, urban gardens that are crucial to involve in the journey of energy transition. Today, new opportunities can be found in the sharing of energy produced by solar plants in neighbourhoods, with plants capable of directly producing energy for households and activities and of exchanging that in access with others living in the same neighbourhood or urban area. The municipality is working on Energy Communities precisely in this direction with the approval of a new regulation that promotes a vision in which energy sharing becomes an opportunity to realise environmental and social projects, supporting households in energy poverty. The Climate Adaptation Strategy has identified the neighbourhoods where the most critical issues with respect to heat wave impacts, through epidemiological studies and the integration of data on the social situation, average age, and the deteriorating condition of buildings. This is where it will be a priority to intervene and where, moreover, any intervention to reduce energy bills generates the greatest benefits, affecting distressed households. At the same time, it is necessary to promote adaptation and mitigation projects that improve the liveability of squares, parks, and streets. In recent years, Rome has already seen a separation between the economic growth curve and the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emission curve. Since 2003, emissions have been reduced by  $34.8\%$  against a  $29.5\%$  increase in GDP. At present, the challenge is to ensure that not only do these two curves move further apart, but that this change allows inequalities to be overcome and helps precisely those families who are struggling the most to reduce their energy expenditure. An inclusive approach in which no one is left behind is the most effective in forging acceptance of the energy transition, making people understand its economic and social as well as environmental benefits.

The methodology used for citizen pathways during the drafting and sharing of the Adaptation Strategy will be the chosen methodology to implement present and future social innovation and governance pathways also within the CCC and towards climate neutrality to 2030. Such an ambitious, articulated and complex process requires a strong involvement of social and economic actors. To accompany and support the choices made and the planned mitigation and adaptation actions, to broaden participation to other economic, industrial and social actors. The discussion on the strategies and actions envisaged by the Climate City Contract will be organised in working groups and will allow the feasibility to be verified and proposals to be accepted, and opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the envisaged policies to be explored in the various areas and sectors. The processes of stakeholder engagement will be increasingly cross-referenced and intertwined, due to the added value that an integrated approach can bring in addressing the problems and needs of neighbourhoods where the impact of heat waves and flooding is getting more and more relevant, involving and sharing with the city's actors the path undertaken and improving its effectiveness.

# 7 The process towards climate neutrality

The Climate City Contract's work has shown that in a city like Rome it is possible to achieve ambitious climate neutrality targets. As we should emphasise, the planned interventions are all verified and with widespread technologies, technically feasible as well as the strategies identified to accelerate the processes. The challenge is to make sure that this horizon of acceleration towards decarbonisation and change in the city is really possible and that the planned choices do not encounter obstacles along the way, that costs and benefits and barriers to be overcome are clear. That intense cooperation between all the institutions and bodies involved be initiated, so as to guarantee adequate resources for investment, support for the structures involved, and the dissemination and sharing of experiences with the many municipalities that would now like to accelerate in this direction.

Decarbonisation is a process of city innovation and change that will involve periodic verification of results, annual monitoring of emissions trends, updating and integration of actions on the basis of new opportunities that may open up to accompany the acceleration of emissions reduction.

Such ambitious and cross-sectoral work inevitably requires new studies and in-depth investigations to identify more effective solutions and opportunities, in a path of continuous improvement and learning. For what has been done with the Climate City Contact in terms of analysis and intervention scenarios should not end with the approval of the tool if the targets set are to be reached. It will in fact be necessary in the coming years to deepen, for example, intervention scenarios and partnership models for financing that will help overcome the limits of the funding available for the planned interventions. Moreover, simulations of the impact that the dissemination of certain technologies could have in strategic sectors, such as construction and production from renewable sources, mobility, management of the electricity distribution network and storage systems, and the possible contribution of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  absorption from forestation measures, will be indispensable.

To complement the CCC the following is planned:

The presentation in 2025 of a study by Enea on the decarbonisation potential of Rome's building stock in the scenario set by the European EPBD;
The submission in 2025 of a study by AESS on the penetration potential of photovoltaic solar energy on roofs, parking lots and agricultural areas;
The presentation in 2025 of a study on green jobs in Rome and the potential in the Climate City Contract scenario, with the aim also of identifying training needs.
The launch of a study on the decarbonisation potential of Rome's industrial districts, with a view to innovation in the management of electricity and water networks and the efficient use of recovery, reuse and sharing systems.
The launch of a study together with the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital on the role of green assets and the ecological network for climate change adaptation and mitigation;
The promotion of a study, in collaboration with Unindustria, on the innovation potential of Rome's production districts on energy and water to reduce consumption, strengthen recovery and reuse, and network integration.
The opening of an expression of interest for research and application projects on the potential of low-enthalpy geothermal energy for the thermal needs of residential areas and production activities.

Each study and proposal will be discussed among the city, interested stakeholders and the research community, as in the case of the Climate Adaptation Strategy.

# 8 Barriers and challenges for the implementation of the Climate City Contract

Such an innovative process inevitably faces barriers in its path that must be overcome in order to avoid delays in implementing such an important and strategic perspective and that must turn into challenges for the work of the Climate City Contract in the coming years. Decarbonising a city like Rome will depend first and foremost on the ambition and effectiveness of the Municipality's programmes and actions, yet these are framed within an articulated system of powers and competences. In Italy, the regulatory powers necessary to have a regulatory framework projected towards decarbonisation are in the hands of the State and the Regions, while funding is also in the hands of the State, primarily, and in part of the Regions.

# 8.1 Resources to finance decarbonisation

The achievement of the Climate City Contract objectives requires significant investments in the sectors involved, with different specificities and features as, depending on the actors involved (public or private), the technologies and incentives available, they will allow a return on investments with different timeframes through management savings. Part of the interventions will need direct state and European non-repayable resources for public interventions, or incentives for private individuals, while others with no incentives will already be competitive but will require credit access mechanisms for investments.

# Renewable Sources

The distribution of photovoltaic plants in the territory has gone from 13,007 plants installed at the end of 2019, the year of the baseline inventory, to 21,846 in December 2023 (GSE data). Despite the considerable growth in recent years, also shown by the data described above, the potential for the installation of photovoltaic systems in the municipal area, especially on buildings, is still significant.

For the installation of solar power on the roofs of buildings in Rome, on the shelters of the largest car parks and for a share of agrivoltaic plants according to the maximum potential covered by the study carried out for the Climate City Contract, the total estimated investment is about 5.5 billion euros (Ref. Investment Plan).

The incentive system currently in force allows investments by households and businesses to be financed up to 50%, through tax deductions, and provides incentives for energy communities and collective self-consumption configurations in line with the European Directive 2018/2001.

Additionally, the barriers to RES plant development concern low-income households, which cannot benefit from incentives due to the absence of income to be deducted, and more generally in the access to credit, which finds issues compared to the guarantees required for investments in the direction of decarbonisation. Large-scale agrivoltaic and photovoltaic plants to cover parking lots, on the other hand, are now in a grid parity in terms of price-production, so most frequent barriers they face are related to authorizations and access to credit.

To make the 2030 objectives concrete, it is important to give continuity and effectiveness to incentives, simplify procedures, solve issues for ineligible families and introduce a fund for access to credit at subsidized rates for this type of intervention.

The knowledge of the photovoltaic potential, both in terms of kWp and related to the most suitable places for installations, is a great opportunity for greater development of this renewable source in the territory.
ROMA

RES installation is associated with the development of the CACER (called CERC – Capitoline Renewable Energy Communities in Rome) which put in place the first concrete steps just as this plan was being written. The development of Renewable Energy Communities is an effective solution to reduce energy poverty and fight inequalities, and a concrete response to the energy prices' fluctuations which imply higher bills.

Authorization barriers are also an issue face by the Capitoline Municipality. The installation procedures are often complex due to the national superintendence which defines limitations and to the legislation on suitable areas which presents strong critical issues for the development of photovoltaics and agrivoltaics systems. The Municipality will simplify the procedures for installing solar panels on the roofs of buildings, as required by Resolution No. 402 approved in December 2022, implementing a national law approved in 2022, in order to reduce one of the main barriers to access in a city where there is a widespread stratification of limitations.

Strong opportunities are given by new technologies (e.g. vertical and/or chromatic panels) and by the increasing development of innovative projects. An example of this is the San Giovanni Addolorata hospital in Rome with its flagship project, also presented on various national working tables, for the installation of a photovoltaic system located on buildings subject to specific limitations.

# Energy efficiency of the private building stock

The planned energy requalification objectives for the building stock - private residential buildings, public social housing blocks, tertiary and industrial buildings, and public buildings - can be estimated at a total expenditure of about EUR 19.17 billion, which concern efficiency upgrades on the building envelope, the reduction of transmittances, and the efficiency/electrification of thermal systems; as far as the tertiary and industrial sectors are concerned, the interventions envisage the reduction of methane, fuel oil and diesel oil consumption in the sector through interventions on the building envelope, systems, and the electrification of overall consumption.

Barriers to the speeding up of interventions are to be found in the incentive systems in force, currently being reviewed by the government, which cover a share of the investment for private interventions but do not reward separately the performance achieved in terms of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  and are inaccessible to low-income households (the individuals with insufficient earnings or 'incapienti' who have no income to declare). As with photovoltaics, households and companies face problems in accessing credit for financing this type of intervention.

As regards the assets of Roma Capitale, it can be estimated that more than half of the buildings (starting with schools, offices, social housing) could be upgraded with the incentive systems in force (including the thermal account, which covers  $65\%$  of the expenditure of efficiency-enhancing interventions) and through public-private partnerships for upgrading and management through tenders and Energy Performance Contracts. For the remainder, the structures' static and decay problems are such that state resources are needed to enable the interventions. A system of access to credit at subsidised rates must also be introduced for the financing of energy efficiency measures.

To realise the 2030 targets, it is necessary to introduce, within the framework of the National Plan for the Renovation of Buildings, provided for by the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), a system of incentives that transparently and progressively rewards the reduction of emissions over a multi-year horizon, and a fund for access to credit at subsidised rates for this type of intervention.

To ease the existing barriers, given not only by the economic difficulty and access to incentives for citizens but also by a need for cultural change that can facilitate the electrification of consumption in private households, Roma Capitale is moving towards several parallel directions while also creating opportunities: thanks to ENEA, a study was carried out on the incentives and tax breaks related to energy efficiency in the area. These results show the extent to which the measures are being implemented and serve as a starting point for future projections and scenarios in the private housing sector.

The Italian Government is in the process of updating the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan. This represents an occasion for the entire country but also for Roma Capitale which, together with the other 8 Italian 'Mission Cities', has presented specific observations and suggestions addressed to private citizens and the entire urban ecosystem.

# ERP Energy Requalification

The stock of public housing managed by the Municipality and Ater will be the priority in the redevelopment interventions for both social and energy reasons, given the current condition of abandon which characterize the structures. Today there is no incentive system that can accelerate these interventions, after the weakening of the Superbonus and given the shortcoming of the Thermal Account. To make these interventions possible, a guarantee fund is needed to access the credit at subsidized rates for the energy redevelopment of buildings, the installation of solar panels and the creation of energy communities, which would allow interventions to be carried out in neighbourhoods and buildings where low-income families live.

The social housing heritage of Rome is extensive with about 25,000 dwellings owned by the municipality by itself, to which are included those owned by the Lazio Region and the housing of individual citizens who have purchased ownership over the years. The large number of dwellings and the plurality of subjects involved does not facilitate the decision-making process necessary to put into practice efficiency and energy saving measures.

Another barrier is the lack of knowledge of consumption and the state of the social housing units. An opportunity, however, is drawing by the study which is currently carried out for the Municipality of Rome Capitale on the mapping of social housing buildings. The outputs will give a more detailed picture about the structures and detailed information necessary to carry out future project of renovation on energy saving and RES production.

A further opportunity is given by the increasing access to PPP – Public-Private Partnership contracts which, if applied to social housing buildings' renovations, could lead to a boost towards the energy requalification of this complex category of real estate assets.

The energy redevelopment of public housing assets has been identified as one of the priority strategies for Rome Capitale.

# Sustainable Mobility

For the implementation of the interventions planned by the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan of Rome - i.e. the construction of line D, the extensions of lines A and B, the construction of the seven tram lines and the adjustments of the existing lines - it is estimated that there will be a need for about 15 billion in investments in the coming years.

Specific and additional resources should be allocated to strengthen the current inadequate public transport service that are made available through the National Transport Fund (which allocates  $40\%$  less per capita allocations than in Milan), in order to increase the frequency of subways, buses and trams in circulation: the estimation for the city of Rome requires almost 160 million euros per year by the Ministry of Transport as part of the national transport fund.

For what concern the private vehicle fleet, the replacement included in the CCC's actions and strategies are related to the renovation of private cars and commercial vehicles with electric vehicles which leads to an estimated cost of 13.6 billion euros.

## Electricity distribution grids

The electricity distribution grid operator Areti, estimates a need for additional investments over and above those currently envisaged in the business plan of EUR 3.8 billion up to 2030 to ensure the resilience of the network to increasing climate impacts, through interventions to recover the obsolescence of the network, the replacement of the oldest parts, and EUR 1 billion for the introduction of storage systems for peak electricity demand, necessary to ensure the flexibility of an increasingly distributed and articulated system in terms of production, storage, consumption.

## Benefits for citizens and businesses thanks to decarbonization

Considering the whole range of buildings, the public and private ones, the institutional ones, the tertiary and the industrials - the energy efficiency measures presented in the Climate City Contract would lead to a significant reduction in gas consumption, with savings in bills estimated at current prices of about 600 million euros per year.

On the other hand, it is necessary to consider an increase in consumption due to the electrification of heating systems and the production of domestic hot water equal to 6% for an expense of about 120 million euros.

At the same time, developing the potential of solar photovoltaic that can be installed in Rome generates direct benefits in self-consumption, sharing in energy communities, and selling to the grid. At current market prices, the valorisation of electricity production from photovoltaics (savings in bills from self-consumption and transfer of excess energy to the grid) can generate an estimated economic value of around €600 million per year.

Overall, it can be estimated a reduction in energy expenditure of around 1 billion euros for the citizens and businesses of Rome who, moreover, would no longer be subject to the fluctuations in gas prices on the international market. It should also be considered that the investment expenditure is calculated on the current data available about technologies' prices which are constantly uncertain and on the prospects of increases in efficiency for solar panels, storage systems, heat pumps.

## 8.2 Ancient Rome, the archaeological finds

Rome, the Eternal City, is famous for its rich history and cultural heritage. However, this same historical richness implies unique challenges on the path to climate neutrality, especially for the transport sector.

During construction and infrastructure development work, important archaeological finds are often discovered which cause delays in construction projects and create barriers to mobility.

For example, during the works for the construction of the new Piazza Pia, archaeological finds were found that required a delay in the project timeframe¹. In another case, during excavations for the new water system in the Appio Latino district, three mausoleums were discovered along the ancient Via Latina. Despite these challenges, Rome is trying to find a balance between infrastructural development and the preservation of historical heritage. For example, the city is working to integrate archaeological finds into urban design and to use innovative technologies to reduce the impact of development projects on historical heritage.

Furthermore, a key point for Rome would be to act directly in these cases which are currently mainly linked to the Ministry of Culture which has direct responsibility and decision-making power over the protection, enhancement and enjoyment of the national cultural heritage.

¹ Also in order to comply with the construction deadlines dictated by the funding received.

In conclusion, Rome's path towards environmental sustainability is a complex and challenging journey, but also full of opportunities. Each archaeological discovery represents a window into the city's past, enriching the urban development with new historical and cultural connections.

## 8.3 Building strong institutional cooperation

A further barrier/challenge is related to the definition of a strong institutional cooperation which brings cities at the centre of the debate. The Climate City Contract is the tool that can make it possible and can accelerate the achievement of the objectives of the European Green Deal starting from the cities through a strong and virtuous integration with national policies. In fact, the urban areas are responsible of the highest demand for energy, transport and materials and it is where integrated interventions can be carried out to enhance and multiply the contribution of renewable sources and energy efficiency, in neighbourhoods and buildings where ambitious results in terms of climate mitigation and adaptation can be achieved. In Italy, reasoning of this type is especially valid if it refers to Rome, the municipality with the largest population, the largest number of private and public buildings and by far the largest territory of a unique Municipality in the whole country.

To become credible, this hypothesis requires that cities, and in particular the larger ones, are involved in the definition of policies and plans through a co-design of priorities and actions, in order to make the results more effective. The State and partly the Regions have still the competence on financing the energy transition, as well as the regulatory power to simplify the approval procedures for projects concerning energy efficiency and renewable energy plants. In addition, an important part of Rome's public heritage is owned by the State (Ministries, Public Bodies, military headquarters) and a part by the Lazio Region (ASL, over 50 thousand public housing units) so it will be important to share the energy redevelopment objectives. An involvement of cities and collaboration between different institutional levels will be essential for the achievement of the objectives of the Climate City Contract. About the PNIEC (Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan) it is worthy to remember that while during the drafting and approval there was not the involvement of the cities, in its implementation phase it is desirable a strong collaboration if the European targets have to be achieved. In Rome, more than 60% of greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings, so an important area of institutional cooperation will have to concern the drafting by 2026, as required by the EPBD (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive), of the National Plan for the Renovation of Buildings (both residential and non-residential and public and private) to identify priority interventions in terms of energy consumption and issues of households, in order to achieve the decarbonisation by 2050. Furthermore, since cities are carrying out a just transition in to order to face the greatest social and economic issues, it is necessary a debate on the National Plan that the Italian government should approve to carry out the measures and invest the resources of the Social Climate Fund to lower energy poverty and the strengthening sustainable mobility for the benefit of the poorest subjects, and which must involve indeed the suburbs of large Italian urban areas.

## 8.4 Training for green jobs

All the analyses confirm the significant potential for the creation of new jobs in Rome in the energy and mobility sector through interventions that aim to enhance the efficient use of energy for cooling and heating homes, self-production and sharing from renewable sources, the retrofit of buildings and the integrated management of plants and the territorial supply chains. The boost of the energy and digital transition, which are now deeply on-going, will depend on the ability to train workers with the technical skills required for the new professions that are taking hold in those sectors which are experiencing valuable and rapid transformation. To strengthen this perspective, it is necessary to put in place a strong institutional collaboration with the Lazio Region (which is entrusted with the competence in the field of

vocational training), the Ministry of Labour and other competent institutions, business and workers' associations in order to identify the gaps in terms of skills and competences to be filled, the interventions necessary to update, strengthen and improve the training offer.
