# 1 Introduction

Reykjavík is the capital and largest city of Iceland. It is located in southwestern Iceland with the latitude of 64°08' N. The city is the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state. Reykjavík's population is 135,000 and the Reykjavík Capital Area which includes 6 other municipalities, has a population of nearly 244,000. The total population in Iceland is 385,000 so the Reykjavík Capital Area holds the largest share of the population in Iceland. Despite the northern latitude of Reykjavík, it enjoys a temperate climate as the North Atlantic Current, an extension of the Gulf Stream shapes a relatively mild winter (average 0°C) and cool summer (10-15°C). Reykjavík is one of seven municipalities partnering in the Association of Municipalities in the Capital Area (Samtök sveitarfélaga á höfuðborgarsvæðinu or SSH) and one of 62 municipalities forming the Icelandic Association of Local Authorities (Samband íslenskra sveitarfélaga or Sambandið).

Reykjavík has a domestic airport just south of the city center. The Keflavik international airport is located 40 km south of the city. Reykjavík is surrounded by sea and has two seaports, the older harbor near the city center, which serves fishing vessels, and the port Sundahöfn, which is the largest cargo and cruise ship port in Iceland.

In Reykjavik's CCC, there will be an overview of suggested citizen engagement, renewable energy within the city, transportation, waste management, the building sector, emissions, tourism, and the 2030 Climate Target in relation to the city's Climate Action Plan and the Municipal Plan. Due to Reykjavik's unique emission profile, the Action Plan will focus on transportation, waste management and the building sector laying out a pathway for green growth within the city.

# 1.1 Citizen Engagement

As a relatively small city, engaging with our citizens has been a top priority for the city since 2011 and is enshrined in the city's Democracy Policy [1] published in 2021. Reykjavík is a world-leader in citizen engagement and democracy and offers a participatory democracy portal (íbúalýðræðisvef) [2], which provides an overview of different ways residents can engage directly with the city.

These pathways will be used to discuss specific issues related to carbon neutrality and will allow the city to actively and effectively engage with residents e.g., the existing suggestion portal (ábendingavefur) [3], where residents can submit suggestions for improvements. In the past, the city has used this portal to receive suggestions from residents regarding improvements, safety issues and feedback on core services in the city.

The same portal can be used for suggestions regarding ways to achieve carbon neutrality. In addition, there are active neighborhood councils that have monthly open meetings where residents can discuss neighborhood issues with city officials on a regular basis. These councils can be asked to discuss specific emission challenges such as transportation within their neighborhoods.

In the city's consultation portal (samráðgátt), residents, businesses and/or third parties can be asked to comment on various in-progress strategic and executive initiatives [4]. The aim is to use the consultation portal for large or small proposals related to the city's climate neutrality journey including core services, new policies, and specific issues related to idea development or solutions. A recent example is the open-ended request for ideas that would increase air quality in the city [5].

# 1.2 Renewable energy

The city transitioned to renewable energy for both power production and geothermal central heating half a century ago. The central heating system was built in response to the 1970s oil shortage when the price of oil for house heating fluctuated greatly and it was considered better to rely on domestic resources. The benefits have been innumerable including accumulative climate and cost related benefits as has been documented by the National Energy Authority (Orkustofnun) [6]. While these numbers are nationwide, they are especially relevant to Reykjavík and the capital area as where two-thirds of the total population lives, and most businesses are registered.

# 1.3 Transportation

Thanks to this historical switch to renewable energy, a mix of geothermal and hydropower for both electricity production and central heating, Reykjavik has a unique emissions profile where most of the emissions come from transportation. Reykjavík is a spread-out city where most of its urban area consists of low-density suburbs. Car dependency in Reykjavík is high, or 707 vehicles per 1.000 inhabitants, which is much higher than the EU average of 516. It is clear that our efforts to become carbon neutral must focus on the transportation sector. The focus will be to decrease the population's dependency on private cars. Doing so will require substantial engagement with different stakeholders, the general public as well as local governmental agencies and businesses. A special focus will be placed on the tourism sector. For the vehicles that will still be required, an energy transition will be necessary, it is likely that this will be done with a mix of electrification, methane and hydrogen.

The main emission sector of the city is due to transport, as both electricity and heating are already generated by geothermal and hydropower.

The city's policies emphasize increasing services for a car-free lifestyle such as increasing density to implement 15-minute districts, increasing infrastructure for walking, bicycling, public transport and micro mobility, while limiting parking spaces and increased charging for parking. Emissions due to transportation are 67% of emissions including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from all the scopes within the city in the base year 2019. The largest part of transportation emissions is due to private cars and service vehicles (mostly in private ownership). Very few companies in the city report on emissions and when they do, the emphasis is on Scope 1 and 2 of their own operations. The emissions from employee's private cars fit into Scope 3 sector (private employers). When GHG of operations are calculated, the emissions from employers are rarely calculated, as Scope 3 emissions are optional [7]. These emissions are included in Scope 1 for the city, so input from individuals and the largest workplaces are extremely important to accelerate the climate-neutrality goal to 2030.

Emissions due to transportation are divided into the following traffic categories (passenger vehicles, public buses, ship traffic and air traffic):

Passenger vehicles: Extensive work on the development of transportation infrastructure is in the 2024 regional Transport Treaty of the Capital Area 2024 (Samgöngusáttmáli) [8], where one of the four goals of the agreement is a carbon-neutral society. In the treaty, the national government and the seven capital area municipalities (SSH) agreed to develop the infrastructure and operate the public transport system in the capital area.
City of Reykjavík

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

In addition to the Transport Treaty, the national government supports financial incentives and the enactment of laws and regulations to encourage the use of electric cars and electric bicycles.
Core stakeholders for city infrastructure are the Planning Officer, Office of Transport and Urban Design, Office of Construction and Maintenance for Urban Density, Infrastructure Planning for Eco-Friendly Travel Design and Implementation of Infrastructure for Eco-Friendly Travel.

The above parties work on infrastructure projects that support changing travel habits, but it is essential to follow through so that residents actually make the change in travel behaviour. There are several parties that influence travel habits. Large workplaces and schools within Reykjavík can encourage staff to reduce the use of private cars with positive incentives such as transport agreements and negative incentives such as parking fees. It is important that the city ensures a just transition in the planning and development of infrastructure and in all actions related to changing travel behaviour.

Public buses (Strætó) and privately owned bus companies can impact how fast things will progress by completing an energy transition in their fleets. The same can be said about trucks, with actions from transport companies, tourism companies and companies that handle home deliveries.
Ship traffic accounts for a large part of transport emissions. The owner of city ports, Faxaflóhafnir, is instrumental in leading the reduction of emissions including the fishing fleet, commercial cargo ships and cruise ships.
Air traffic. When evaluating GHG emissions from aviation, flight figures from the Icelandic airport and navigation service provider (ISAVIA) are used. This first version of the CCC does not include actions that will address air traffic emissions.

## 1.4 Waste

The second-largest emissions factor within the scope of the mission is waste. The capital area biogas and composting facility (GAJA) and a common waste collection system that was recently implemented, have already made a significant impact. The Action Plan aims to further improve the services and reduce emissions from waste by taking measures to implement a circular economy within the city and its surrounding area.
Extensive work, due to the implementation of recycling laws and changed waste management, has been carried out in the seven municipalities operating in the Capital Area [9] with a unified system in place to ensure that all residents follow the same procedures for waste segregation and recycling. Core stakeholders in the city are the Planning Officer, Office of Environmental Quality, City Land Office, and Sorpa as well as private waste management companies and all companies operating within the city (including the operation of Reykjavík City itself) as well as all residents.

## 1.5 Growth &amp; the Building Sector

The third focus area for our climate contract is the building sector, which mainly falls under Scope 3 emissions. The building sector is out of the scope of the mission but will be included in this CCC. Reykjavík is a fast-growing city and has the goal of building 1,000-1,500 new apartments per year until 2030 in dense, mixed-use development with neighborhood sustainability as a guiding principle. In addition, the city's comprehensive
City of Reykjavík

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

plan includes large infrastructure projects that will be built within city boundaries in the near future, aimed at better connecting different parts of the city.

Building sector - materials: Extensive work on green structures has been carried out in a broad consultation under the umbrella of a collaborative project between the government and building sector stakeholders called "Building a Greener Future", and the City of Reykjavík is participating in that project [10]. A number of stakeholders participated in that work and the follow-up of the actions that were put forward there are important to achieve carbon-neutrality.

## 1.6 Other Scope 3 Emissions

Industrial processes and product use (IPPU): The government is an important actor due to the follow-up on establishing rules for the phasing out of F gases. Fisheries companies (due to the use of F gas in freezer trawlers) and the national hospital (Landspítali-hákólasjúkrahús) are especially important stakeholders for this action. Retail stores and other businesses that use refrigerants in their operations would also be affected. The government's climate Action Plan lists actions to reduce these emissions that are addressed in this CCC.

Domestic food production. Emissions from food production are calculated as a percentage of Iceland's emissions and are small compared to, for example, emissions from construction materials. Actions regarding food production are not anticipated in this first version of the CCC.

## 1.7 Tourism

Reykjavík is a popular tourist destination, with 90% of visitors to Iceland visiting the city during their trip. The number of tourists visiting Iceland per year has grown from roughly 1 million guests in 2014 to over two million guests in 2024 with projections for 2030 as high as 3,5 million guests [11]. In 2023, approximately 200,000 hotel nights were sold in Reykjavík each month.

Visitors come to Reykjavík to experience nature. The city is by the sea and surrounded by mountains. It is easy to do day trips to visit popular tourist destinations such as black sand beaches, waterfalls, and hot springs, and in winter there is also a chance of viewing the northern lights. The city also has a bustling cultural scene and boasts of its own opera and symphony despite its small population size.

The most popular transportation choice for tourists is a rental car. With rapidly growing numbers of tourists presenting an additional challenge for the city's carbon neutrality goal. Visitors must have access to sustainable transportation in order for the city to reach these climate goals. This will require better connections to Keflavik Airport by bus or train, as well as a higher proportion of car rental cars being electric. Working towards a more sustainable tourism sector is in line with the government's Tourism Policy until 2030 (published in 2024), Leading in Sustainability: Icelandic Tourism Until 2030) [12].

The city's tourism policy (Ferðamálastefna Reykjavíkur 2020-2025 [13]) has a weak emphasis on sustainability but will need to be replaced in 2025 with a stronger emphasis on sustainability in the next version. The marketing of Reykjavík City as a destination for tourists has been outsourced to the capital area marketing office (Markaðsstofa höfuðborgarsvæðisins) which now runs the website Visit Reykjavík to attract tourists on behalf of the capital area. The marketing office will also publish a Destination Plan (Áfangastaðaæltun [14]) which includes the future-vision for the area. The next
City of Reykjavík

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Destination Plan is scheduled to be published, by 2026 and will have a strong focus on sustainability. Through the capital area marketing office we can work together with the tourism sector and the other municipalities in the Capital Area.

## 1.8 2030 Climate Neutrality Target

The goal stated in the Expression of Interest EOI was the goal Reykjavík set in 2016 to become carbon neutral by the year 2040, and that adaptation to climate change will take place in an environmentally sound and human friendly manner. The city supports the goal of the Paris Agreement to maintain global warming within 1.5°C. Actions will be revised in 2025 and then every 5 years after that. The milestone towards 2030 in the current CAP was to reduce GHG emissions by 300.000 tonnes CO2eq, or 57%, based on the baseline year of 2019 according to the current CAP 2021-2025. The target needs to be accelerated to reach the minimum of 80% reduction by 2030 and this CCC is an important milestone to reach this goal.

The goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2040 included emissions within BASIC+ (Scope 1, 2 and 3 in the waste sector) but the new 2030 climate neutrality target will be expanded and include Scope 3 emissions as well, as there are considerable emissions from building materials for new construction within city boundaries. The target is to meet the requirements of the mission and reduce the emissions by 80% of the GHG emitted in 2019. As Scope 3 emissions are added at the same time as carbon neutrality accelerates, there is an increased need for collaboration with a number of parties. How this will be done will be outlined later in this document. The target will cover the entire administrative territory of the city as it has done since the first CAP was made in 2016.

## 1.9 Formal Procedures and Planning Frameworks

The Reykjavik City Municipal Plan (Aðalskipulag Reykjavíkur [15]), is the statutory framework for the city's future planning. The CCC Action Plan must be in accordance with the municipality plan, especially regarding large scale development that controls the city's growth and minimizes sprawl. Growth boundaries are also targeted in the Capital Area Regional Plan, developed by the seven capital area municipalities (SSH) [16] and the national planning legislation and regulatory framework. All actions that require the expenditure of funds must go through a formal process of the Finance and Risk Management Division and actions that require political approval must be approved by the official planning council and/or the city council.

The CCC Action Plan's objectives will be in accordance with the current CAP with a strong focus on transportation issues although more actions will be added, both actions that are already in place and others that will be developed by external parties such as municipally-owned companies, the government, SSH, the private sector and the general public. Additional actions are intended to accelerate carbon neutrality to 2030.

## 1.10 The Role of this CCC and Connection with Current Climate Action Plan

The CCC will include the current CAP 2021-2025 which replaced the CAP 2016-2020, which replaced the SECAP in 2015. This first CCC will bring together existing efforts in the current CAP and the actions that will be taken with the participants in the Climate City Agreement that are listed in the commitments.

The first CCC Action Plan covers actions needed to accelerate the transition to the climate neutrality goal from 2040 to 2030. However, this cannot be done only by the
City of Reykjavík

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

city. Reykjavík has a detailed CAP until 2025 where the biggest challenges are addressed. The actions that are not completed in that Action Plan will be continued. In addition, actions from external stakeholders will be added. These are actions that have already been put on paper in a broad consultation with a number of parties, such as actions by city- and government owned companies, but also the formulation of actions on how resident consultation in Reykjavík will be linked to the climate debate.

BAU will not be used to calculate the emissions gap. The emissions gap is the difference between what Reykjavík's current CAP delivers in terms of reduction in emissions and the standard that is the requirement in the CCC, i.e. that the estimated emissions in 2030 do not exceed 20% of the emissions in 2019.
As in previous climate action plans, there will be actions in all emission categories, but it is important to highlight two things.
Reducing emissions from road traffic will be a major challenge. Population growth is expected in the city. Further reducing CO₂ eq emissions in the transport sector will not be achieved solely by transitioning to electricity. It requires reducing road traffic, i.e., changing travel behaviours. Information is needed on why the car culture is so strong in Reykjavík and how it is possible to accelerate the needed change in travel modes to reach carbon neutrality by 2030. This information will be created and sourced as part of the Pilot cities project Cohort 3 – Piercing Through the Gridlocks.
The increase in the population of Reykjavík also affects the amount of waste, energy consumption and the use of construction materials used in the construction of housing. Overall, it will be a challenge to reach the 20% mark without further tightening the actions listed in this first CCC.
It will also be a big challenge to assess which actions are most suitable if it becomes necessary to buy carbon credits. The carbon offsetting market in Iceland is currently immature [17]. At the end of 2024, a working group on behalf of the government made a report on carbon offsets and recommendations for the next steps.

# Part A – Current State of Climate Action

## Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

Reykjavík has been a member of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM) and its predecessors since 2012. Part of this covenant is the publication of the GHG emissions inventory of the member municipalities, and the City of Reykjavík has published the GHG emissions inventory in the CDP web portal since 2015. In recent years, the accounting has been done by an external consultant from EFLA consulting company. The following is a summary of the last memorandum regarding Reykjavík's 2022 GHG emissions inventory [18].

The methodology used for the assessment for Reykjavík is called the City Inventory Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC), which is published by the GHG Protocol. A similar methodology has been used to estimate GHG emissions from Reykjavík every other year between 2007 and 2019, and every year thereafter. With each publication, both the information gathering and the data collected have improved, and therefore it is not appropriate to compare the total figures obtained in those submissions, but rather what is calculated based on the current data and emission factors, especially within each category. The climate inventory comes with a dashboard that can be used to compare all the available categories. In the climate inventory, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are taken into account and converted into CO2 equivalents. Factors are based on AR5, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and are 28 kg/kg for methane and 265 kg/kg for nitrogen oxide. In the AR6 report, the nitrogen oxide factor changes to 273 kg/kg.

Emission sources of GHG are divided into Scopes based on origin and use. Scope 1 is emissions of GHG from sources within the city limits. Scope 2 is GHG emissions resulting from electricity, heat, steam or cooling used within city limits and distributed by a utility or distribution system. Scope 3 is all other GHG emissions outside the city limits that occur as a result of activities that take place within the city limits, that is, indirect emissions that occur further up or down the value chain. Results are displayed as BASIC, BASIC+ and BASIC+ &amp; Scope 3. Under BASIC, only Scope 1 and 3 waste management, scope 1 transport and scope 2 energy consumption are considered. The BASIC+ model adds to this product use, industrial activity as well as emissions from agriculture and land use, and BASIC+ &amp; Scope 3 additionally adds other items that belong under Scope 3. Thus, the available GHG emission inventory for BASIC+ emissions meets the requirements set forth in the Cities Mission's Info Kit for Cities. In addition to the requirements, Reykjavík will include Scope 3 emissions from the building sector, as the city is growing and aims to build thousands of apartments over the next years.

Emissions accounting has been compiled every year since 2019 and submitted to the CDP porta. The climate inventory for the year 2023 was submitted to the CDP web portal in October 2024.

The result of the climate inventory has had a significant impact on the strategic planning that has taken place in the Municipal Plan, the Climate Policy and the RGD, as transport is by far the largest part of the emissions when looking at BASIC+. The focus of these policies is to reduce the need for travel through the densification of settlements and the development of 15-minute districts that reduce GHG emissions in the long term. The city's CAP and RGD also emphasize the promotion of public transport, active modes of travel and especially the Cycling Plan, the energy transition of vehicles, including public transport in the Climate Policy and the RGD. The main actions in the current Action Plan [19] are highlighted in Figure 2, and the estimated reduction of those actions until the year 2030 is stated. The emissions inventory for the city includes energy, transportation, waste, AFOLU and IPPU

Energy: Emissions are divided into 3 categories: electricity, heating, and fuel consumption at construction sites. Emissions due to electricity and heating fall under Scope 2 due to connections to the distribution and transmission system that is managed by Reykjavík Energy, which plans on carbon-neutral energy production in 2030, which coincides with the City's CAP. The City's role is to control and support those actions, but it is not directly involved. However, the city is yet to put forward actions to reduce local fuel consumption at construction sites except those that have been mapped by the Green Building Council (Grænni byggð), and set out in Ecological Construction (Vegvísir að vistvænni mannvirkjagerð, 2030), which the city takes part in.

Transportation:

Passenger vehicles: Extensive work on the development of transport infrastructure and its financing has been carried out under the umbrella of the Transport Treaty of the Capital Area, where one of the four goals of the agreement is a carbon-neutral society [20]. The central government and the surrounding regional 7 municipalities (SSH) agree to that agreement for the development of infrastructure and the operation of the public transport system in the Capital Area.

Due to changing travel habits: A change in priorities regarding the densification of settlements and an added emphasis on changing travel habits appeared in the 2040 Municipal Plan, which was published in 2014 and was followed up in the Climate Plan and the RGD. These priorities have been followed up on during the development of neighborhoods and infrastructure, as well as raising awareness through participation in a variety of incentive projects, such as Cycling to work, Transport Week, the Car-Free Day, and Green Steps in the City's activities.

The main challenge remains to change travel modes and electrify the fleet.

Waste: Great success has been achieved with the changed waste collection system, which includes the development of infrastructure (GAJA) and changed behaviour, increased sorting of waste by city residents. In the resolution on waste management in Reykjavík, it is stated that private companies are required to sort waste at source in the same waste categories as citizens. The sorting of individuals is strictly enforced by Reykjavík's waste collection staff. It is not known how the resolution is being enforced by private waste management companies that provide collection for private companies. This will be addressed in this Action Plan.

Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU): The biggest opportunities here are carbon sequestration through forestry and wetland reclamation, which is part of the current CAP and is also pursued in the RGD. Agriculture is an insignificant part of emissions that will not be addressed in this first CCC.

Industrial processes and product use (IPPU): The City has no control over emissions due to F gases, but in the recently published CAP of the government, a significant reduction is expected due to restrictions on the import of F gases and it can therefore be assumed that the reduction will be relatively the same within the city limits.

Building sector - materials: Emissions from the building sector are also a part of IPPU and until now, Scope 3 emissions have not been addressed. However, Reykjavík is a growing city with ambitious plans to increase the number of apartments and residents until 2030. It is therefore important to monitor these emissions so that the growth is as little as possible at the expense of the climate and the environment. Actions to reduce those emissions are therefore added in this CCC.

# Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

ICELAND: The government participates in European co-operation on climate issues, based on the EEA agreement and joint enforcement (EU, Iceland, Norway) of obligations to the Paris Agreement. The EEA provides Iceland with access to EU's internal Trading System (ETS) for emission allowances, enabling the economic instruments to create incentives. The joint Iceland-EU enforcement of the 2030 emission goals of the Paris Agreement, further states that Iceland should achieve a  $29\%$  reduction by 2030 in GHG emissions outside the ETS and preliminary analysis indicates that the new commitment under the  $55\%$  target will be approx.  $41\%$ . The government itself states the aim of  $55\%$  total reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 in its CAP, ETS and LULUCF not included [21].

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)
Figure 3: If assessed direct climate action is considered, the estimated reduction in action is  $35\%$  from 2005 to 2030 [22, p. 16].

The Icelandic Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate enforces the country's obligations toward the Paris Agreement, in accordance with the Icelandic Climate Act (70/2012). The law defines the bases for governing climate issues and the information gathering provision regarding GHG release and sequestration, for sharing with international organisations [23].
Different negative aspects of climate change are dealt with in different national ministries but especially the Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate, Ministry of Infrastructure, Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and the Prime Minister's Office. The government sets its climate goals in the international CAP which is regularly revised and published on the website www.co2.is [24].
The long-term goal of the country is carbon neutrality by 2040, and road transport is the largest contributor of GHG emissions when excluding IPPU and LULUCF. Iceland's Climate Action Plan estimates a  $35 - 45\%$  reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2005. Waste management is another significant GHG emissions contributor, a  $66\%$  reduction is expected by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, primarily due to a ban on organic waste landfills and changes in pastoral care. The EU Waste Framework Directive (2008/98) requires that municipal waste prepared for reuse or recycling should be  $55\%$  of all waste by 2025,  $60\%$  by 2030 and  $65\%$  by 2035. Furthermore, no more than  $10\%$  of all municipal waste should be landfilled in 2035 [23].

Capital Area: The capital area's regional plan Climate Action Plan 2024. SSH has just commissioned a climate inventory for the year 2022 and presented for an action plan for the 7 municipalities that are a part of SSH. The climate inventory shows that the emissions that the municipalities can have the most influence on are emissions from road transport and waste.

The government evaluates its Action Plan based on emissions in 2005 and has an independent goal of a 55% reduction by 2030 compared to emissions in 2005 with reference to emissions under ESR (Effort Sharing Regulation) [24]. The projected reduction in emissions due to actions related to road transport (vehicles and infrastructure) is a total of 199,000 tonnes of CO2eq. Relatively comparable reduction can be expected in Reykjavík, since the priorities are the same in the government's Action Plan as in Reykjavík, i.e. to promote infrastructure for active transport, public transport and energy transition. A relatively similar reduction in IPPU could also be expected. The government's Action Plan includes specific actions that are expected to reduce emissions due to IPPU by 117,000 tonnes of CO2eq.
In SSH's Climate Plan, it is assumed that emissions will be reduced and the percentage of reduction or increase in all emission categories is calculated until the year 2035 compared to 2022, but no total number is mentioned.
In the City's CAP made in 2021; Reykjavík City's emissions are expected to decrease by 300,000 tonnes until 2030.
No figures are mentioned in the Municipal Plan or the RGD, but they both generally discuss carbon neutrality in 2040.

materials, as shown in Table B-3-1 Impact Pathways. Excluding these emissions for further comparison more directly to the Mission requirements, the residual emissions would be 30.000 tCO2eq less than approx. 27% of the baseline emission. This highlights the influence of including or excluding certain emission categories.

The emission gap table reflects the current situation. Further iterations of the CCC will seek to enhance alignment of the portfolio of actions with the 2030 climate neutrality target (80% reduction from 2019 baseline) with the portfolio of actions (column 5 of Table A-2-2).
While the current residual emissions equal 30% of the 2019 baseline emissions, the goal is to address 10% of the remaining emissions through additional actions involving current and future participants and address only 20% via compensation measures.

# Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

## A.3.1 Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

Developments in recent years in the City of Reykjavík are delivering change. The transportation fleet is slowly transitioning to electricity, and both public transport passengers and cyclists have increased. The circular economy is promoted to encourage climate-friendly and zero-emission practices, and household waste management has been radically re-figured.

Nevertheless, GHG emissions have increased overall. The number of residents is growing, as is the number of vehicles serving a fast-growing tourist industry. Circular solutions are not always accounted for in GHG inventories in both the private and public sector.

Progress towards reaching carbon neutrality by 2030 is currently far too slow and will not be achieved unless significant and rapid mitigation tactics are applied. High car dependency and resistance to waste reduction/reuse/recycling/repairing approaches are found to be barriers to change.

Emission figures from traffic match travel habits in Reykjavík, whereby the largest part is the use of private cars to and from work. The largest workplaces in Iceland such as the universities and the national hospital (Landspítali-háskólásjúkrahús) are in the Vatnsmýri area in the centre of Reykjavík. It is known that one way to promote public transport to and from work is to charge for parking at workplaces. Employees then prefer to travel by public transport, and the parking spaces are used by visitors and customers of the workplace as short-term parking during the visit. Some of the largest workplaces in Iceland have worked to prepare for parking fees including the National hospital, the University of Iceland, and the University of Reykjavík. Parking fees also increase the likelihood that tourists will use other means of transportation than rental cars within the city limits. 90% of tourists visit Iceland, they were 2.2 million in 2023. Of these, 3/5 rent a car, 1/5 travel by private bus, 3% by public transport and 14% by other means.

Faxaflóahafnir – the port has an obligation to electrify the port prior to 2030. This process has already started but large cruise ships visiting Reykjavík present a challenge. A working group is currently working on determining the amount of cruise ships and passengers the city can accommodate in a sustainable manner and Faxaflóahafnir have implemented the Environmental Port Index (EPI).

## Waste

Emissions due to waste are rapidly decreasing after the treatment of organic waste started in the biogas and composting facility (GAJA) operated by Sorpa. Reykjavík only manages waste collection for households and follows up on sorting in such a way that if waste is not correctly sorted into the appropriate bins, the bins are left behind with an appropriate message. The recycling rate and state of sorting from households is closely monitored.

Private parties manage waste collection and the reception of recyclables at private companies. In a resolution on waste management in Reykjavík, it is stated that private companies are obliged to sort their waste at source like individuals, but it is not clear how this is enforced. Co-operation with the waste collection companies is therefore an important part of following up on the resolution and ensuring that private companies participate in reducing emissions due to waste.

The GAJA biogas and composting facility began operations in the latter half of 2020 and the percentage of organic matter in landfills has decreased accordingly. Since waste emissions are calculated based on estimated total waste in landfills, the numbers reduce in correlation with the amount of organic matter sent to GAJA. Banning organic waste in landfills is certain to reduce emissions overall, albeit the increase in composting produces some level of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  eq in return. Detailed data exists on the collection of household waste and proportions of recyclables, published on the website of the Environment Agency [26]. However, there is a lack of information on how well or poorly businesses are sorting and recycling.

All kinds of waste are still thrown into the "grey bin" designated for landfills or "waste to energy" recovery, including organic matter. Recyclable plastics and paper from businesses are also still ending up in unsorted waste. In short, much more needs doing to speed up the progress, but the glaring challenge is recognizing and acting against Scope 3 emissions, which include reusable and recyclable materials from households and operations. They are exported rather than resourced locally. More generally, Reykjavík needs to prepare for near-future standards of calculating consumer-based emissions.

# Regional:

In connection with the Action Plan for the Capital Area, the area's carbon footprint for the year 2022 has been compiled. It shows that the part that the 7 municipalities can have the most influence on with the lowest possible cost are road transport at the planning stage. See Figure 6.

![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)
Figure 6: The interaction between the influence of municipalities on emissions and the costs of actions in selected emission categories. Farthest to the right are the emission categories that municipalities can influence the most, i.e. waste and transport. The larger circles indicate higher emissions. Light blue colour indicates emission categories where effective actions have recently been implemented, i.e. waste management improvements and port electrification [25].

The CCC is a unique opportunity for a targeted approach, given all businesses will be offered the chance to sign commitments on their own terms.

The city will continue to collect data on GHG emissions in the relevant categories, as has been done in recent years.

To support and speed up carbon neutrality, it could be beneficial for those who sign the commitment to set themselves benchmarks to monitor what changes the actions will bring, such as staff surveys about travel habits and how the proportion of waste treatment categories is calculated. This needs to be elaborated in more detail in the co-operation of the participants in this first CCC.

## A.3.2 Critical Stakeholders

To reduce emissions within the city limits to reach carbon neutrality, the following external stakeholders are necessary participants:

**The national government**

Iceland has a goal of carbon neutrality by 2040, our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030 will greatly increase the likelihood of that goal being met. There are common challenges, especially regarding transportation. Many of the largest projects related to climate require that the national and municipal governments work together and are laid out and funded in the Transport Treaty (Samgöngusáttmáli ríkis og sveitarfélaga á höfuðborgarsvæðinu). The national government also has a Transportation Plan (Samgönguáætlun [20]) which lists the infrastructure priorities at each time at the national level. The government's Climate Action Plan includes actions that have a major impact on Reykjavík's emissions accounting, but are also factors that municipalities, including Reykjavík, do not have a direct influence on, i.e. the introduction of regulations, the ban on the import of fossil-fuel vehicles and equipment, tax incentives for energy transition and restrictions on the import of other materials that have a high climate impact.

**The Association of Municipalities in the Capital Area (SSH)**

The Capital Area is so integrated that it will be necessary to involve all the municipalities in order to have the desired impact. The municipalities work together through municipally owned companies on public transportation, waste collection, the implementation of a circular economy, sewerage and more areas related to carbon neutrality goals. These are presented in the Vision for the Capital Area (Sóknaráætlun) [27] and in a common Climate Action Plan and Strategy for the Capital area [28], which includes the target to be carbon neutral by 2035.

**Reykjavík City's municipally owned companies (b-companies)**

The municipally owned companies will be important stakeholders as they are responsible for energy production, public transportation, the port, sewage and waste collection. Reykjavík City can engage these companies individually through their governing boards. When working with many of them at the same time, working groups are formed to tackle specific issues. Two such working groups are in place in 2024 that are directly relevant to the CCC, one focusing on the circular economy and another focusing on a speedy energy transition.

**Reykjavík Energy**

Reykjavík Energy (Orkuveitan) manages all core utilities for Reykjavík City, including energy and water distribution, wastewater collection and treatment and an optical fiber network. Additionally, Reykjavík Energy produces electricity and hot water for the city through combined geothermal heat and power plants. Reykjavík Energy is in the process of setting science-based actions through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) where the goal is to attain net zero scope 1 emissions by 2030 and net zero scope 3 emissions by 2040. Scope 1 emissions stem mainly from its two geothermal power plants (geothermal gas). The company is currently capturing 25% of CO2 in one of its powerplants, Hellisheidi geothermal powerplant, which by 2025 will be scaled up to a capture capacity of 95%. This technology will then be implemented for the other power plant (Nesjavellir) by 2030. The captured gas can then be sequestered permanently using the Carbfix method or utilized.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

SORPA
Sorpa receives and manages the waste in the Capital Area and are instrumental when it comes to waste collection and implementing further sorting of waste within the area. Sorpa produces compost and methane which can have additional benefits, the methane can also be used as part of the energy transition and is currently used as fuel for the city's garbage trucks. Sorpa will also be a key player when it comes to implementing a stronger circular economy in Reykjavík.

Strætó
The public bus company Strætó services the Capital Area, Reykjavík included. Increasing the use of public transportation will be very important in order to realize the goal of carbon neutrality. The electrification of their fleet will also have an immediate impact on the city's emissions portfolio. The necessity of offering more frequent bus rides and better service is something that is frequently mentioned in conversations with businesses and the public.

Faxaflóahafnir
Faxaflóahafnir, the Associated Icelandic Ports, are responsible for harbor activities in Gamla höfnin í Reykjavík (the Old Reykjavík Harbour), Sundahöfn, Grundartangi and Akranes, as well as facilities for smaller boats in Borgarnes. Faxaflóahafnir bases its operations on a 100-year history of port management and is a key player in the development, improvement and operation of important infrastructure in the transport network and the economy of Iceland.

Reykjavík Science City / Vísindaporpið í Vatnsmýrinni
Reykjavík City has a working group which consists of the largest players in the area of Vatnsmýri. It consists of academia and the largest hospital in the country. The members are the University of Iceland (HÍ), the University of Iceland's Science Park (Vísindagarðar), Reykjavík University (HR) and the National University Hospital (Landspítali). This group meets 2-4 times per year to discuss infrastructure and transportation in the area. These institutions are geographically located in Vatnsmýri, and are amongst the largest workplaces in the city. They are also the leading academic institutions in Iceland.

University of Iceland / Háskóli Íslands
The University is a state university, situated in Vatnsmýrin, It is a progressive educational and scientific institution, renowned in the global scientific community for its research. Additionally, The University holds a leading role in sustainable energy and environmental research. The main role of The Sustainability Institute at the University of Iceland (Sjálfbærnistofnun Háskóla Íslands) is to catalyse, facilitate and coordinate research to promote sustainable development, both within and outside of the University. The Institute also serves as a collaborative hub, partnering with parties outside the University, such as the government, municipalities, institutions, companies, non-profit organizations and individuals. There are 1,700 staff members and 14,000 students at the University.

Reykjavík Science Park / Vísindagarðar Háskóla Íslands
The Science Park is a flourishing community where universities, companies and research institutions work together to find creative solutions to today's most pressing challenges.

University of Reykjavík / Háskólinn í Reykjavík.
Reykjavík University is a large workplace with many students, it has a strong connection to the Iceland Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Federation of Icelandic Industries. The University has a strong focus on sustainability, for example the Sustainability Institute and Forum (SIF) which is a research institute that engages all departments in matters relating to sustainable development. Reykjavík University has notable sustainability research projects in the areas of geothermal and ocean studies in partnership with Cornell University.

Landspítali University Hospital
Landspítali is the leading hospital in Iceland and the largest workplace for employees in health care. It is funded by the Ministry of Welfare, supervised by the Directorate of Health and provides specialized and general care and has the capacity of approx. 700 beds.

Festa – Centre for Sustainability
In 2015, Festa and Reykjavík’s climate declaration was signed by 104 businesses in Reykjavík pledging to reduce emissions of GHG, reduce the waste they produce, and measure the impact of these measures. Today, 182 members have signed the declaration, and Festa has 40 events per year that aim to make companies and institutions more sustainable. Festa will be a key partner for outreach efforts towards businesses in the city as they are already actively engaged with many of them, and notably the largest businesses in the city. With a long history of climate declarations and the Icelandic carbon neutrality by 2040 target already well known within the city, the key to engaging these businesses again will be to have concrete and measurable actions for them to take part in. These will be developed in collaboration with Festa and their partners.

The Housing and Construction Authority / HMS
The role of the Housing and Construction Authority is to protect public life quality, assets and the environment by ensuring professional preparation for construction and active monitoring of quality and safety, thus contributing to a better supply of affordable housing, both for rent and for lease. We aim to assess future needs and estimate the supply of housing to contribute to greater stability in the housing market.

Visit Reykjavík / Markaðsstofa höfuðborgarsvæðisins
Visit Reykjavík is the official tourism organization for the Reykjavík Capital Area. It was established in 2023 by six municipalities and the tourism industry. The project had previously been housed at the Office of the Mayor and the CEO of Reykjavík City and earlier at the Department of Culture and Sports. Visit Reykjavík promotes and develops the destination in a sustainable way, with a focus on increasing economic activity. Through collaboration with partners in the tourism, transportation, and cultural sectors, Visit Reykjavík enhances the visitor experience and showcases all that Reykjavík has to offer.

# Part B – Pathways Towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

## Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Reykjavík has a policy of carbon neutrality for the year 2040 and a detailed Action Plan to achieve this goal. With this CCC, that policy is being honed further, and carbon neutrality is being accelerated by a decade, or until the year 2030. It is estimated that actions from the current CAP will result in a reduction of nearly 50% in 2030 compared to 2019 as the baseline year [29]. The minimum goal of an 80% reduction in emissions by 2030 can only be achieved with the participation of more parties.

The summary table in B-1 shows the actions that will signpost the path towards carbon neutrality. The actions are listed by sector. Actions from the previous Action Plan, which is valid until 2025 and are still being worked on, are listed at the beginning. These are actions based on previous action plans that have been formulated as a follow-up to the first Climate Action Plan (SECAP) in 2011 when Reykjavík became a member of the Covenant of Mayors, action plans that were renewed in 2016 and again in 2020. Actions from previous plans are based on what is within the City's sphere of influence and is related to the planning authority and infrastructure development in all sectors. The actions are planning for the 15-minute districts, green city development, energy transition, the Cycling Plan, Cityline and improved public transportation, circular thinking, ecofriendly structures, carbon sequestration, adaptation actions, and actions regarding the operations of the CoR. They remain important actions to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. Older actions from the previous action plan are either left unchanged or combined with other actions, and this is noted separately. See explanation in Table B-2.1a.

In addition, there are actions that parties other than the City need to implement to speed up carbon neutrality. Many of the actions have already been formulated by the relevant parties and, as they are an important contribution to carbon neutrality, they are included in this contract. Although the actions were in place before they were discussed as part of the CCC, they had to be shaped in collaboration to fit the template that the CCC requires. The template of the actions was important when starting to approach responsible parties of each action, and all those approached were positive about participating in this first CCC. Many actions are based on current ecosystems. For example, the municipally owned companies have their own policies on carbon neutrality, work with the largest workplaces in the country to change travel habits has been underway, a working group is working on energy transition, co-operation for ecological building construction has been ongoing and co-operation between municipalities on a recycling, sorting and climate policy, co-operation with non-governmental organizations such as Festa and Grænni byggð as well as, last but not least, co-operation with municipalities, the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration (Vegagerðin) and the government on a Transport Treaty in the Capital Area. All of these actions, i.e. actions from the action plan 2021-2025 and new actions that the participants in the CCC are involved in are listed in table B.-2.1b. Further explanation on the columns and difference of the estimated emission reduction can be found in next section.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

## B.1.1 Description of impact pathways

The impact pathways chosen are those which have the most effect on accelerating the transition to climate neutrality to 2030 and reduce GHG emissions in the fastest way. Reykjavík has a policy of carbon neutrality for the year 2040 and a detailed CAP to achieve that goal. By participating in the Climate Mission, that policy is being honed, and carbon neutrality is being accelerated by a decade, and the goal is now to be carbon neutral by 2030. That goal can only be achieved with the participation of more parties in all sectors. Participants who sign Climate Neutrality Commitments undertake to submit one or more actions, which are being worked on, to reduce the effects of climate change.

The pathways relate to the current state (GHG inventory) and the actions needed to close the gap. Reykjavik has used its own estimations of reduction from the current Reykjavik CAP which was a part of the work preparing for the EOI for the mission in 2021. Reduction from additional actions with participants in this first CCC are estimated as well by Reykjavik. The economic model is used in Reykjavik CCC Investment Plan and is added to the impact pathways to explore the use of the model in the future.

As a part of the process of this first Reykjavik CCC and learning curve all estimations of possible impacts are found in Table B-1-1. The goal is to use the NZC Economic Model and the NZC Planner for future estimations of impacts of actions. It is obvious that whatever method is used, actions in the transportation sector have the most impact.

## B.1.2 Estimated reduction from current Reykjavik CAP

The largest percentage of emissions in Reykjavík is due to transportation, and therefore most of the actions are a part of that sector. The estimation from the national CAP is used to estimate the effects of increased use of public transport, regulations and electrification of the fleet.

Energy. All heating and electricity use in Reykjavík comes from renewable sources, a mix of hydropower and geothermal energy. Nevertheless, Reykjavík Energy has an ambitious goal of making its energy production carbon neutral by 2030. By requesting their participation in the CCC, Reykjavík is emphasising that their actions matter, and that this goal supports the company. Carbon-neutral energy production benefits all users, not only the City of Reykjavík as such, but all companies and residents.

Transportation: Changes in transportation are first addressed through planning, how the city is planned to reduce the need for travel. Updating the planning, implementing the 15-minute districts and focusing on green urban development therefore remain important projects, and one of the actions of the CCC. Extensive work on the development of transport infrastructure and its financing has been carried out under the umbrella of the Transport Treaty of the Capital Area. The effects of these changes will be felt later than 2030 but are an important contribution to encouraging active modes of travel and the use of public transport by those who work in the city, live in the city and tourists who visit the city. The risk here is that the infrastructure will not be used, and therefore co-operation on changing travel habits with the largest workplaces and schools within the city is part of the actions in the CCC. The City of Reykjavík itself is one of the largest workplaces in Iceland, with around 10,000 employees, so it is very important which actions the city itself puts in place to reduce the need for employees to travel to and from work as well as for work.
City of Reykjavík

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

It is expected that the number of trips will decrease as is the norm when the settlement becomes denser. It is also assumed that trips by car will remain stable and the percentage of active modes of travel will therefore increase. At the same time, it must be ensured that the fleet of cars that will be on the city's streets, whether they are private cars, goods transport vehicles, buses, vans and public buses run on green energy sources, where electricity is the main choice. Technological development in that sector has been rapid, but investment in such equipment is expensive. The fleet is changing, but it has progressed slowly, so one of the actions is to continue with the work of the working group on "energy transition everywhere", which refers to energy transition in the City's car fleet, and also how energy transition can be encouraged, for example through procurement. The continued emphasis on active means of transport is due to the co-benefits of more people on the streets, better air quality and increased likelihood of exercise becoming part of the daily life of the city's residents and visitors.

Waste: Great results have been achieved with the altered waste collection system, which includes the development of infrastructure (GAJA) and the behavioural change of increased sorting by citizens. With the introduction of GAJA, an opportunity has also been created to use the methane that is created as a source of energy for waste-collection vehicles and buses. Waste prevention is always the most important action to reduce emissions within that sector.

Reykjavík only manages waste collection for households and follows-up on sorting in such a way that if waste is not correctly sorted into the appropriate bins, the bins are left behind with an appropriate message. The recycling rate and how sorting from households is going is closely monitored. Private parties manage waste collection and the reception of recyclables at private companies. In a resolution on waste management in Reykjavík, it is stated that private companies are obliged to sort like citizens, but it is not clear how this is enforced. Co-operation with the waste collection companies is therefore an important part of following up on the resolution and ensuring that private companies participate in reducing emissions due to waste.

Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU): The biggest opportunities here are carbon sequestration through forestry and wetland reclamation, which is part of the current Climate Plan and is also pursued in the RGD. Agriculture is an insignificant part of emissions that will not be addressed in this first CCC. It is necessary to plan and prepare well which areas will be used for forestry and which areas will be used for the reclamation of wetlands, so that they are also useful for citizens and support biodiversity. How carbon credits of sequestration for land use are calculated has not been decided. Actions to assess sequestration due to land use therefore need to be carried out simultaneously with an assessment of the carbon market in Iceland in general. That market is immature, and it is unclear where it would be best to go to compensate for possible residual emissions.

Since carbon sequestration from forestry (sinks) began to be assessed in Reykjavík, carbon sequestration in forestry has been assessed by two different parties who came to somewhat different conclusions. When carbon sequestration was calculated, including forests in urban areas, the carbon sequestration was calculated as 22,812 tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year. This figure was used in Reykjavík's climate accounting for 2015-2019. From that time, a different
City of Reykjavík

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

methodology was used, where, among other things, the IGLUD database was used to calculate carbon sequestration, carbon sequestration decreased to 10,587 tonnes CO2 equivalents due to a changed methodology and at the same time emissions from land use were estimated, resulting in net emissions from land use being around 45,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalents. That figure has been used in climate accounting since 2019. Both methods come with limitations, e.g. due to the quality of the data available. For example, the IGLUD database is not updated often enough to be able to rely solely on it. In 2022, the GHG Protocol issued new guidelines regarding carbon sequestration in urban areas. A policy is being prepared for how the assessment of carbon sequestration will be carried out in Reykjavík under the title "Carbon sinks – evaluation of next steps"

Industrial processes and product use (IPPU): The City has no control over emissions due to F gases, but in the recently published National Climate Action Plan of the government, a significant reduction is expected due to restrictions on the import of F gases and the introduction of regulations. It is important that those actions succeed, and the city supports those actions.

## Scope 3:

Building sector - materials: Until now, Scope 3 emissions have not been addressed and have not been included in the City's previous climate action plans. Data collection on these emissions is new, and it can be assumed that the methodology for estimating emissions from the building sector will mature until the year 2030. This will be a good preparation for when requirements are made to list emissions in Scope 3. Reykjavik is a growing city with ambitious plans to increase the number of apartments and residents until 2030. It is therefore important to monitor these emissions so that the growth is at the expense of the climate and the environment as little as possible. Actions to reduce those emissions are therefore added in this CCC.
Domestic food production. Emissions from domestic food production are insignificant and will not be addressed in this first CCC.

## B.1.3 Estimated impacts of CCC actions

Where it was possible to estimate the impacts of CCC actions the calculations was made from the action plans from the participants themselves. In some cases, the impacts are proportional for the city, and calculated to fit into the city boundaries e.g., the impacts of the actions from the Icelandic government were calculated in proportion of the estimated reductions in the Icelandic national CAP [24] Also, Reykjavik Energy and the port are partly outside the city boundaries.

## B.1.4 Direct impacts estimated from NZC Economic model

The data collected for the Economic Model is a mixture of already available data, such as demographics and emission factors, and calculations and assumptions for other factors. Where the data was not available for Reykjavik City a source of pre-filled data from the model was used, for example from a comparable city, EU targets and also public datasets such as Eurostat.
City of Reykjavík

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

C

Some data were not available, for example share of type of heating renovation, based on the fact that the city is more or less a part of the central heating grid (derived from a sustainable source), a fact reflected in the Economic Model outcome, showing less emphasis needed on the heating sector. The impacts and costs/benefits are calculated against Business-as-Usual case, showing the effect of the Climate Action Plan, compared to the scenario of the Climate Action Plan not implemented.

Transportation. For transportation need, it is calculated by using average km driven (travel survey), average passengers and number of vehicles registered in Reykjavík. The Economic Model assumes 23% reduction in motorised passenger transportation need, based on a forecast for the Reykjavík City Climate Action Plan. The assumption for shift to public and non-motorised transport is based on the City Planning for 2040 and the Economic Model reference City (Zaragoza), where reduced km is assumed at 30%, shift to buses 30%, shift to walking and cycling 70% and shift to trains/metro 0%, as the City does not have any trains or metro and current plans do not include trains or metro.

The national energy forecast assumes a maximum of 50% of the passenger car fleet that can be electrified by the year 2030. The public bus company Strætó plans to have 82% of the fleet exchanged to electric by the year 2030 but does not offer further breakdown of the procurement scheme for years. The electrification of trucks is estimated by the National Regulatory Authority to be by 100% by 2038 (light duty trucks) and 90 by the year 2060 for heavy duty trucks.

The Economic Model assumes that the share of minor heating renovations is 80%, compared to 20% extensive heating renovations, based on the fact that the City is more or less a part of the central heating grid, based on sustainable extraction from a geothermal water source. In line with this, the share of district heating is expected to be 95% by the year 2030. For energy efficiency estimates are not readily available, thus the numbers for the reference city of Zaragosa apply. The share of geothermal heating is 100% today, and is expected to stay the same, as well as the share of renewable electricity production.

For the increased recycling of waste, all assumptions are based on EU targets. The model does not include estimation of impacts on AFOLU and IPPU as it is not a part of the emission scope as it is listed in the EU mission "Toolkit for cities".

## B.1.5 Co-benefits and indirect impacts

Looking beyond the benefits of reduced GHG emissions indirect impacts and co-benefits are considerable.

The transport category has co-benefits connected to less air pollution and less traffic congestion. Less air pollution can result in better health and better quality of life for the citizens, as air pollution is connected to respiratory health issues. It can also be assumed the "gray days" will be fewer, where people are encouraged to stay indoors due to pollution, especially for exercise and children playing. Less traffic congestion also decreases air pollution and increases quality of life where people spend less time in traffic. In addition, the health benefits of using non-motorised transportation can be many, as exercise as a part of daily lifestyle is good for both physical and psychological health. A socioeconomic analysis for the Transport Treaty addresses the combined impacts of all projects included in the pact, which includes for example Sæbraut cut and cover, Miklabraut tunnel, a few highway projects and Borgarlínan (Bus Rapid Transit system). The analysis shows a socioeconomic net benefit of 1140 billion ISK over the 50-year analysis period

and an internal rate of return of 9,2%. The Transport Treaty causes external effects to the environment, neighbours and others. There externalities result from the change on modal split and kilometres driven by vehicles. The expected future shift towards a car fleet running on renewable energy is incorporated in the unit values for noise, air pollution and climate.

For electrification of harbour, the harbour operator, Faxaflóahafnir, assumes the co-benefits of improved air quality, and fuel savings – important element in supporting decarbonization of ships.

Building renovations create more jobs, and both building renovations and new energy-efficient buildings decrease the need for energy. Led lighting is less polluting than other types of lighting and are also more energy efficient.

Decarbonising of heating and electricity generation results in less air pollution. Based on the energy produced by Reykjavík Energy, the hydrogen sulphide emission intensity in geothermal power plants has decreased since 2016, from just over 2 grams per kilowatt hour to around 1.5 grams in 2023. Hydrogen sulphide emissions from Hellisheidi Power Plant and Nesjavellir Power Plant totalled around 9.7 thousand tonnes in 2023. The hydrogen sulphide (H2S) concentration did not exceed the 2023 limit. The relative hydrogen sulphide injection from Hellisheidi Power Plant was 64% in 2023. Hydrogen sulphide injection began on a pilot scale at Nesjavellir Power Plant in 2023 and was 8% of the power plant's emissions. The Hellisheidi power plant is planned to be decommissioned in 2025 and the Nesjavellir power plant in 2030, which means that almost all hydrogen sulphide from the power plants will be captured and bound in rock.

Increased waste recycling and emphasis on the circular economy reduces the need for new material harvesting, increasing the protection of natural resources.

When the Reykjavik transition team started to write the CCC the estimated impacts of actions were based on calculations which were made when Reykjavik's EOI to the mission was made in 2021. The NZC economic model was introduced to the team in 2023. At first it was not clear if it would be possible to use the Economic model to estimate impact pathways as some data was missing and Reykjavik's profile seemed too different compared to other cities due to the high proportion of renewable energy and high proportion of the use of fossil fueled private cars. As the CCC process has evolved and with the introduction of the NZC Planner, where the Economic model is the input for data, the team would like to further develop the use of economic model to estimate the impacts and co-benefits of actions.

## Involvement of stakeholders and participants on new actions

Stakeholders were contacted by members of the Transition team, and new actions were proposed. The new actions in the CCC were presented to stakeholders prior to the signing of the commitment in October 2024. The stakeholders who decided to participate provided input on the actions and committed to formulating actions that measurably reduce greenhouse gas emissions, support Reykjavik’s climate goal of becoming climate neutral by 2030 and participate in annual consultation meetings until at least 2030. The following chapter describe actions co-created with signatories and participants of this CCC.

B-2.2: new actions of the CCC prepared with or by the participants of the CCC.

|  Reykjavík Energy 2030 target from 2016 baseline  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Action name | Climate neutral energy production by 2030  |
|   |  Action type | Implementation of Reykjavík Energy climate goals 2025 and 2030 [30]  |
|   |  Action description | Reykjavík Energy (RE), is an energy- and utility company in majority ownership of the City of Reykjavík. RE operates two geothermal power stations; Hellisheiði power plant and Nesjavellir power plant. In those power plants, geothermal steam is utilised for power- and heat production. The steam consists partially of two GHG, carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4. Typically these GHGs are released from the geothermal steam and emitted into the atmosphere. However, RE has developed the Carbfix method, a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology which permanently mineralises CO2. A cornerstone of RE's emission reduction strategy is the implementation of the Carbfix method for the geothermal facilities. Since 2016 the geothermal power plants have accounted for 65-75% of RE's total GHG emissions. At Hellisheiði power plant, the current capture capacity is in the range of 25%. However, RE plans to fully scale up the capture capacity at Hellisheiði by 2025, allowing a capture rate of 95% of CO2 emissions from the power plant by 2025. Pilot injections started at the Nesjavellir power plant in early 2023 and RE aims for full scale injection at the power plant by 2030. RE aims for reduction of GHG emissions by 90% in Scopes 1 and 2, and by 40% in Scope 3 by the year 2030, compared to the emission levels of the baseline year 2016. The climate goal is confirmed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and meets the requirements of climate science to keep the temperature increase below 1.5°C. Furthermore, RE aims to reduce emissions in its supply chain, Scope 3, by 90% by the year 2040.  |

|  Implementation | Responsible bodies/person for implementation | Reykjavík Energy (Orkuveita Reykjavíkur)  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action scale & addressed entities | Regional scale  |
|   |  Involved stakeholders | Reykjavík Energy and subsidiaries, University of Iceland, CNRS in Toulouse, and the Earth Institute at Columbia University participated in the development of Carbfix.  |
|   |  Comments on implementation – consider mentioning resources, timelines, milestones | To achieve its climate targets, RE has outlined significant steps in its reduction strategy. These include the complete implementation of the Carbfix injection method at the Hellisheiði geothermal power plant by 2025 and achieving full-scale injection at the Nesjavellir geothermal power plant by 2030.  |
|  Impact & cost | Generated renewable energy (if applicable) | 9200 GWh, there of: - 3500 GWh electricity from geothermal power plants and a small hydropower plant - 3100 GWh hot water from geothermal power plants - 2600 GWh hot water from low-temperature geothermal wells  |
|   |  Removed/substituted energy, volume, or fuel type | N/A  |
|   |  GHG emissions reduction estimate (total) per emission source sector | All geothermal heat in Reykjavík is supplied by Reykjavík Energy. Reduction in emissions from the RE therefore affects Reykjavík directly. Through carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) at RE's geothermal power plants, we project an emission reduction of 51.000 tCO2eq in 2030 compared to the baseline year 2016. This can be disaggregated to emissions reduction of 27.000 tCO2 related to electricity production and 24.000 tCO2 related to heat production. Also, goals on lower emission factor from electricity will also have effect, the factor was 9,9 g CO2 eq/kWh in 2016 and is projected to reach 0,6 gCO2 eq/kWh in 2030 with a CO2 capture capacity of 95%. If energy consumption in Reykjavík stays the same the emissions will lower in line with the emission factor.  |
|   |  GHG emissions compensated (natural or technological sinks) | After reaching 90% emissions reduction, RE will compensate for the residual emissions using certified carbon credits. Currently, RE is purchasing credits though UN's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).  |
|   |  Total costs and costs by CO2eq unit | Total costs for realising fully scaled capture plants and sequestration infrastructure have not been projected for both of RE's geothermal power plants. A cost assessment of the Carbfix method was projected as $25 per tonne in 2018 [31].  |

## B.2.1 Summary Strategy for Residual Emissions

Residual emissions will be 30% of the 2019 baseline emissions to reach Net Zero by 2030. The residual emissions reflect the current situation and further iterations of the CCC with current and future stakeholders will address at least 10% of this emission, which is around 60.000 tonnes CO₂ eq, 20% residual emissions are around 116.000 tonnes CO₂ eq. As previously explained, the CCC goes beyond the mission definition by including building materials in IPPU scope 3 emissions. The goal is to address at least 10% of those emissions via additional actions and address only 20% via compensation measures.

## Strategy on 10% residual emissions

To reduce the 10% residual emissions of 59.438 tonnes CO₂ eq in future iteration of the CCC, the main focus will be on transport, waste and land use.

### Transport:

The economic model forecasts higher emission reduction than was previously forecast in the current Climate Action plan, or approx. 20.000 tCO₂eq more. This is mainly due to the energy transition in the car fleet. Focus will remain on collaboration with stakeholders, and further efforts will be made to reduce emissions from transport, e.g. through proposals from the Energy Transition Group and the implementation of the Capital Area Transport Agreement. As mentioned in the IP the actions connected to transport are the most cost-efficient to reduce emissions from transport.

### Waste:

Additional actions in the waste sector with emphasis on reducing waste through the Hringrásargarður (green and circular industry park) will possibly reduce emissions. However, the reduction has not yet been estimated.

### Land Use:

Changes in calculations of land use emissions bring the possibility of additional carbon sinks, potentially by reducing the current calculated emissions close to net zero. Previous methods estimated carbon sinks within Reykjavik urban area at around 20.000 tonnes CO₂ eq, but these were not included in current estimates due to different methods as described in Section B.1.2 Estimated reduction from current Reykjavik CAP

## Strategy on 20% residual emissions

To reduce the 20% residual emissions of 115.150 tonnes CO₂ eq in future iteration of the CCC the possibilities of technical solutions of carbon capture and carbon credits will be explored.

## Carbon Capture projects

Since 2012, the company Carbfix has captured CO₂ from Reykjavik Energy's geothermal power plant at Hellisheiði and at Nesjavellir since 2023, The method used is defined as a local Carbon capture and storage method. The CO₂ is injected into basaltic rock formations, where it mineralizes and is stored as carbonate minerals, stones. This method is safe, cost-effective, and has been extensively tested [36]. This

capture plays a role in de-carbonizing electricity in Reykjavik and the greater Reykjavik area.

At Hellisheiði the company Climaworks has been operating for the past few years practising Direct Air Carbon Capture [37]. Their technology could possibly be implemented in other locations, reducing emissions i.e. from transport.
The Coda Terminal is a new innovative project by Carbfix, funded by EU emissions Trading system. It is located in Hafnarfjörður, a nearby municipality of Reykjavik and within the greater capital area. The terminal will receive CO₂ from various sources, including IPPU emissions and direct air capture. The carbon will be captured for storage using Carfbix’s proven technology. The project aims to store up to three million tons of CO₂ per year [38]. This can possibly result in available carbon credits for IPPU emissions by non-state actors in Iceland, including Reykjavik City.

# Carbon offsetting

Iceland's carbon offsetting market is developing but has lacked regulations and guidelines. In November 2024 a working group on behalf of the Icelandic Government submitted a report on carbon markets in Iceland and proposals for action. The working group presented several recommendations which are in line with the requirements in the Info Kit such as the term carbon unit should be defined by law, a set of guidelines for the quality of carbon units purchased and “...Carbon units and projects that produce them – and that public entities purchase – should have received confirmation from an accredited / credible certification body and should be of genuine benefit to the climate” [38]. Those changes will be beneficial for Reykjavik City on the decision on next steps for carbon credits.

# Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

## Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

### C.1.1 Description of the governance model for climate neutrality

#### NetZeroCity project:

There is a steering group with elected officials, with the Deputy Mayor as the foreman, the chairmen of all the political parties, the Mayor included and also the Director of Environment and Planning and Head of Climate Change Affairs, Department of Environment and Planning. The political committee of Environment and Planning has the political responsibility of policies, including the Municipal Plan and the Climate Action Plan.

Actions that need political decisions are discussed in the steering group, the Committee of Environment and Planning relevant political committees and when needed in City Council.

Climate neutrality is a part of the Reykjavik Green Deal which has a core team with staff members from all the divisions of Reykjavik City, Environment and Planning, Culture, Education, Welfare, Sports, Mayors Office, Service, Finance and Human Resources. Climate risk and resilience is approached through the Municipal Plan.

#### Responsibility for climate mitigation policies within the City

The primary responsibilities for climate mitigation policies and cross-sectoral coordination of the climate agenda is with the Department of Environment and Planning, Department of Municipal Planning and Climate. Cross sectoral co-ordination for RGDis with the Mayor's Office.

Legal procedures in planning work in all stages of planning by the Department of Environment and Planning. The public can participate in the creation of development plans through resident forums or other consultations.

#### The Reykjavik Green Deal (RGD)

The city has put in place RGD which offers an overview regarding the city's journey towards sustainability. It is a unique project which allows citizens as well as other interested parties to follow closely how the City is working across departments towards creating a truly sustainable city,

# Reykjavík City's municipally owned companies (b-companies)

The City's municipally owned companies will be important stakeholders as they are responsible for energy production, public transportation, the port, sewerage and waste collection. Reykjavík City can engage these companies individually through their governing boards.

Reykjavík City has seven municipally owned corporations. They are; the Associated Icelandic Ports, Faxaflóahafnir, the social housing provider Félagsbústaðir, asphalt plant Malbikunarstöðin Höfði, Reykjavík Energy (Orkuveitan), the fire brigade Slökkvilið höfuðborgarsvæðisins, the public bus company Strætó and waste collector Sorpa. Each of them has ambitious climate goals.

Sorpa and Strætó are municipally owned corporations, owned and run by the municipalities in the Capital Area together. They will both be instrumental in the journey towards carbon neutrality. Sorpa also runs gas- and compost facilities for the municipalities.

Reykjavík Energy is co-owned with the municipalities of Akranes and Borgarbyggð, it is the largest geothermal provider in Iceland and supplies Reykjavík with 100% of its house-heating needs, as well as electricity. Reykjavík Energy holds the utility company Veitur, the renewable power company ON power, the fiber channel provider Ljósløiðarinn and the innovative carbon capture and mineralisation company Carbfix.

# Working Groups

Reykjavík City often addresses multifaceted challenges through working groups and has a system in place to include the correct parties from the municipally owned companies in that process. As an example, we have two such working groups in place in 2024 that are directly relevant to the CCC, one focusing on the circular economy and another focusing on a speedy energy transition. Actions suggested by these groups are likely to make their way into future reiterations of the Climate Contract.

# Work with key stakeholders

The City of Reykjavík, the Mayor's Office, and EIT Climate-KIC invited key stakeholders from the City of Reykjavík and city-owned companies to a designed for decision-makers in key areas that are essential to the success of the city's Net Zero City initiative. The topic was collaboration with entrepreneurs and innovators. The workshop was held November 13th at the City Hall.

As Reykjavík strives to meet its ambitious net zero goals, collaborating with entrepreneurs and innovators is essential. Entrepreneurs and innovators bring fresh ideas, advanced technologies, and agile solutions that will play a vital part in solving the complex and interlinked climate challenges as Reykjavík moves towards a net zero future. The workshop focused on unlocking the potential of entrepreneurial collaboration to overcome Reykjavík's urban challenges and achieve its Net Zero goals.

# Objectives of the workshop were:

Facilitate collaboration among key stakeholders from various departments in the City of Reykjavík, by identifying and developing action-oriented ideas for involving entrepreneurs and innovators in achieving the city's Net Zero goals.

Introduce and explain the concept of Net Zero Cities to the key stakeholders, highlighting its potential as a platform for fostering innovative project development and implementation.

The outcomes from the workshop were clear and many groups worked on similar topics regarding communication/process barriers and financing that present a great opportunity for more alignment and collaboration. Climate Kic will in the first month's of 2025 hand a report over to the City of Reykjavik with recommendations and follow-ups. The City of Reykjavik will use the results and recommendations as input into policy making and action plans in the fields of innovation and digitalization.

# Festa &amp; the Business Sector

Festa: Centre for Sustainability for Companies in Iceland, includes both large companies and SMEs. In November 2015, over one hundred CEOs of companies and organisations signed a declaration to reduce GHG emissions with Festa and Reykjavík City. This was a big milestone, and it was gratifying how good the participation was, the project even attracted attention at the international level and was presented at the Paris Climate Conference (COP21) at the end of 2015. The products of this work are a knowledge community, a common methodology and Festa's Climate Meter (based on international standards) that companies can use to analyse their emissions and set targets. Festa has been expanding their climate work, and part of their participating companies are working on or have implemented Science Based Targets initiatives (SBTi). The Climate Meter is still up and running for all companies.

# Innovation in the City

For the "smart" part of becoming a climate neutral and smart city by 2030 it will be essential for Reykjavík to engage directly with the blossoming innovation sector within the city. The aim is to create a fertile ground for new ideas to flourish. This is laid out in the Reykjavík City Economic and Innovation Strategy 2022-2030 [39]. We already support some projects that foster innovation and offer entrepreneurs the resources to allow their dreams to become a reality.

**Fablab Reykjavík** offers anyone a place to make a physical product with access to their lab. This access is not restricted to university students, literally anyone can walk in off the street with an idea and use their equipment that includes 3D printing, CNC-Milling, Circuit production, laser, precision milling, vinyl cutting and more. Various technological innovations have been developed within Fablab Reykjavík.

Website: Um Fab Lab - Fab Lab Ísland

**Iceland Innovation Week** is held once per year in Reykjavík with a different focus each year. They have, for example, highlighted innovation related to carbon capture, the blue economy and circularity. The headline act, Ok Bye, a unique climate performance, mixes together cultural elements and innovative leaders. This is a very popular event and attracts many people from abroad, including investors.

Website: Iceland Innovation Week

**KLAK Icelandic Startups** offers business accelerators and workshops for entrepreneurs. They aim to increase the number of start-up companies and increase sustainable value creation in Iceland. They also help startups grow by connecting them with experts, investors and other key players. Their accelerators have different focus areas, they are: The Golden Egg, Hringiða, Startup SuperNova and Dafna.

Website: https://klak.is/en/

**The Golden Egg** is a competition for people with brand-new ideas, it offers people the opportunity to work on their idea so that it will become pitchable. Over 100 people from within the innovative community take part as innovators, investors, experts giving advice and more. Many Icelandic companies that are well known today started their journey here.

# Clusters in the City

In Reykjavík, there are many clusters which foster innovation, sustainability and increase competitiveness within their members. They tend to be sector-based and very successful, usually including the entire range of businesses from their sector, from the largest companies to startups. They offer a very efficient path to engage with entire sectors on specific problems and Reykjavík City already works closely with them. This can surely be harnessed in order to meet the goal of carbon neutrality by 2040.
Examples of clusters that work within the city and we would aim to co-create actions within future editions of the climate contract:

# The Iceland Renewable Energy Cluster

The Iceland Renewable Energy Cluster serves as a collaborative platform for companies and institutions involved in the Icelandic energy sector, covering the entire value chain from exploration to utilization. This includes power producers, developers, research institutions, various service providers (such as consulting, manufacturing, maintenance, and services), academia, and public entities. By representing all stakeholders in the energy sector, the cluster serves as a collective voice for the industry.
Its primary objective is to enhance the competitiveness of its members and the overall society while showcasing the capabilities of its members. It initially operated as Iceland Geothermal, primarily focusing on geothermal energy. In 2018, it expanded its scope to encompass all energy sources in Iceland, including geothermal, hydropower, wind power, and X-Power.
Emphasizing collaboration, knowledge sharing, and development, the organization conducts various activities to foster innovation within the field. These initiatives aim to strengthen both local and global competitiveness and drive value creation in the renewable energy sector.

Website: https://energycluster.is/

# Iceland Tourism Cluster Initiative

The main objective of the Tourism Cluster Initiative is to promote competitiveness and value creation within the Icelandic tourism industry, and to develop a co-operating forum for different stakeholders where the main focus is on linking them together and opening up for interaction between them.
The members of Iceland Tourism Cluster Initiative are 45 from all over the value chain of Tourism. The cluster network consists of travel agents, tour operators, hotels, attractions and activities, restaurants, airlines, public relations, IT solutions, maintenance service, engineer service, banks, foreign exchange, law firms, educational institutions and retail.

# The Iceland Ocean Cluster

The Iceland Ocean Cluster is a world leader in 100% Fish. Supporting, connecting, incubating, investing, and growing startups that create value from material formerly considered waste.

The Mission of the 100% Fish Project at the Iceland Ocean Cluster is to inspire the seafood industry and seafood communities to utilize more of each fish, increase the value of each fish landed, support new business opportunities, increase employment and decrease waste.

100% Fish presents the range of products made out of fish in Iceland. Seafood, supplements, medical and design products are made out of fish and fish parts. Included in these products is the traditional business of providing seafood but a lot of innovation is happening in Iceland with regards to how fish is utilized, and new products are being made from this development. Tons of these products are now made and exported each year out of materials previously wasted. Icelandic companies within the Icelandic Ocean Cluster develop supplements, proteins, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other high-value products from different parts of the fish.

# Pilot Project: Piercing Through the Gridlocks

Reykjavík is a selected Pilot City Cohort 3. This Pilot is designed to involve networks of public and private enterprise, resident and grassroots organisations to address well-known challenges and barriers of reducing GHG emissions. The city and its associate organisations are already engaged in a broad range of quantitative measuring and calculations that are periodically reported and widely shared. The Pilot started in September 2024 and will build on those and add new measures into the mix with emphasis on qualitative means for future monitoring. Thus, it will be supportive to this CCC.

The Pilot activities are divided as follows:

Ways of worldmaking – fact, fiction and storytelling – analysis of the factual, fictional and storytelling discourses about environment and climate issues which will feed into the outreach.

Networks of power, practice and decision-making: Interdisciplinary public participation study using softGIS data collection methods centred on the themes of transport and waste management. Methodological and impact frameworks – review of current indicator data and periodic report on progress, explore both complementary values and discrepancies finalising in a valuation of the effectiveness for follow-up intervention.

Outreach: communications of all activities with seminars / learning courses, knowledge exchange workshops with stakeholders across public institutes and organisations, media events and more.

Interventions – focus groups with residents, resident councils, neighborhood grassroots initiatives and businesses in the sectors of hospitality, retail and office-based operations.

# ECT Call

The project includes emissions from several factors, e.g. due to transport/mobility, building materials and planning policy. The goal of the project is to assess the climate impact of development in Reykjavík and ways are to reduce it. The aim is to assess the impact of development on the travel behavior of residents, comparing the environmental costs of different parking solutions and the climate impact of different building materials and construction. Reykjavík's partner in this project is VSO. The project will start in April 2025 and will run in parallel with the Pilot Cohort 3 project until September 2026.

# Twin City to Lahti

Reykjavík is a twin city to Lahti in Finland. The co-operation between Reykjavík and Lahti addresses ecological transport and how to encourage people to use active transport. The basic element of the project is that partner cities, or twin cities, exchange knowledge and experience of each other's climate projects. Lahti is a Pilot City for NetZeroCities and was chosen as the European Green Capital 2021, and it is therefore clear that Reykjavík will have a valuable opportunity to learn and transfer best practices that will support the changes that need to take place, and thereby support the CCC. Since the cities were paired in September 2023, work has been underway to create a

framework for knowledge sharing and exchange of views. This includes meeting in each of the cities to share best practices and lessons learned.

## Bloomberg Youth Climate Action Fund

With the support of Bloomberg Phianthropies Reykjavik has established the Youth Climate Action Fund to support projects on climate issues. The fund aims to activate youth in finding solutions to the climate crisis. It provides support for projects that are designed and executed by young people aged 15-24. The funding available for each project is 140.000 – 690.000 ISK (approximately 960 – 4.700 EUR) Projects must support and reference Reykjavik’s Climate Policy. Several projects were funded in 2024 and applications for projects will open again in spring 2025.

# Module C-2 Social Innovation Interventions

In order to reach the goal of becoming a carbon neutral and smart city by 2030, we will engage directly with residents in the city, using systems that are already in place but adapting them for the goal of carbon neutrality.

To empower and include citizens in the decision-making process leading to climate neutrality, we will make use of Reykjavik's long-standing culture of citizen engagement and mechanisms already in place. The city allows for participatory democracy when the citizens feel so inclined. A portfolio of democratic processes is in place, and when citizens want to send the city tips or comments regarding any issue, there is a way for them to do so. We do not expect everyone to have an opinion on everything, but it is important that when citizens want to express their opinions, there is a way/platform for them to bring forward their case and for the city to listen. These methods/platforms have already been put in place and are available in everyday life in order to consult with citizens and prevent conflict. For example, the city follows strict procedures regarding introducing planning initiatives to the public and allows citizens to send in suggestions through the open consultation portal (grenndarkynningar, skipulagsferlar á samráðs- og skipulagsgátt). Citizen engagement is done both proactively and reactively.

Examples of mechanisms already in place that we will use for the CCC include the consultation Portal (Samráðsgátt) and Citizen's Convention (Borgarøþing). They are institutionalized in the government model already but their focus on climate change is new.

The city also has ways to include vulnerable groups specifically and when appropriate we will make use of consultative committees; the Elderly council, the Intercultural council and Accessibility and Consultative Committee for Disabled People (Öldungaráð, Fjölmenningarráð, Aðgengis- og samráðsnefnd í máleforum fatlaðs fólks).

For the past 15 years, Reykjavik and municipalities in Iceland have tried and tested many ways of participatory democracy, and with regards to learnings from such experiments, has accumulated significant expertise in the matter. Building on that experience, we will design processes when consulting with our citizens on climate actions. It is important to be respectful of citizen's time when consulting with them. The willingness and ability of citizens to participate is not without limits, therefore it is especially important that they feel that their time was put to good use. When we invite citizens to consult on climate issues, their time and effort should result in concrete actions.

# C.2.1 General Overview and History of Participation in Reykjavik

In the aftermath of the economic collapse in 2008, more and more emphasis has been placed on participatory democracy in the City as is enshrined in the Democracy Policy which was published in 2021. Reykjavík is a world-leader when it comes to citizen engagement and participatory democracy.

After the economic collapse in 2008, demands were made for various reforms in Icelandic society, among them the demand for transparency, more democracy and more opportunities for the public to influence decision-making, especially in local authorities. A new law on local governments was introduced in 2011. An entire chapter of the law deals with consultation with residents and their involvement in municipal affairs, the duty of local governments to inform residents and the right of residents to demand a general vote on individual issues.

In 2008, neighborhood councils were established in all neighborhoods of the city of Reykjavík, but in 2017 they were abolished in their original form, and in 2019 new residents' councils were established with a new system that is still in force. The change was made in order to strengthen the ties between the residents' councils and the city politics and administration.

After the municipal elections in 2010, development work began, which led to the creation of our participatory budgeting project in 2011, and it has been in constant development since then. Our project has undergone a lot of changes in the 13 years since it began. The name has been changed, the rules have been changed, the amount voted for has been changed and in fact every aspect of the project has been in constant development since the very beginning of the project.

We have also developed and tested more projects, some of which have been successful and others not. The guiding light of our work today is the Democratic Policy and its implementation. The Action Plan of the policy is very ambitious and is renewed every 3 years.

We have a participatory democracy portal³ in place, which gives an overview of different ways for citizens to engage directly with the city. These pathways can also be used to discuss specific issues related to carbon neutrality and will allow us to actively engage our citizens.

For example, our participatory budget project can be dedicated to climate related issues and the resident councils can also support us on our journey to carbon neutrality. The resident councils are active in all neighborhoods and have meetings every month. They allow residents to communicate with city officials on a regular basis. We can ask these councils to discuss specific challenges such as transportation within their neighborhoods.

Also, our Consultation Portal which is used to solicit ideas and opinions of citizens on various projects in Reykjavík can be used to gather opinions and ideas from residents, businesses and all stakeholders on ways to reach climate neutrality.

In the Reykjavik Climate Action Plan 2021-2025 different methods were used in consultation with citizens and stakeholders. his was before the Consultation Portal opened. Advertisements for ideas regarding actions in climate matters were published on the web, on radio and in newspapers during the period 15 November until 8 December 2019. TA total of 200 ideas were received through the web in addition to proposals that were received by the steering group by e-mail and at meetings. One meeting was held with external stakeholders, businesses, academia, NGOs and one meeting was held with interested staff of Reykjavik in order to seek ideas for new actions regarding climate affairs.

## Specific consultation actions regarding the Climate City Contract:

The 2025 citizens' convention will be on climate/environmental issues. Emphasis will be placed on environmentally friendly means of transportation in Reykjavík.
Consultation Portal opened at the same time as the Citizens' Convention – gathering opinions and ideas from residents, businesses and all stakeholders on ways to reach climate neutrality.

## Citizens' Convention

Annually, The Reykjavík City Council holds an open Citizens' Convention at Reykjavík City Hall to discuss a predetermined topic. The Convention is a formal forum for citizens and the

city council to have a conversation about the issues of the City of Reykjavík. The aim is to increase the possibilities of the participants to influence the City's strategy and administration and gives residents the opportunity to have direct contact with the elected representatives through a conversation about what is important to them at any given time.

# Citizens' Convention on Climate/Environmental Issues (Consultation Action 1)

By making the Citizens' Convention about climate issues and the challenges that citizens face due to climate change, we encourage discussions on the subject and give residents. Athe opportunity to express themselves about the situation and how it impacts them. In Reykjavík, many decisions have been made regarding transportation, parking, garbage collection and more, which have created heated discussions in society. At the Citizens' Convention, citizens can have straightforward discussions with City representatives about such actions, and at the meeting, it is possible to call for new ideas to tackle climate change and hopefully inspire participants and politicians to cooperate in the future regarding Reykjavík's carbon neutrality.

The result of the Citizens' Convention, along with the ideas and opinions submitted through the Consultation Portal, will be compiled in a report, which will be sent to the City Council for processing.

# Consultation Portal

Reykjavík City's Consultation Portal is used to solicit the ideas and attitudes of citizens on various projects in Reykjavík. It allows residents to give their opinion on the many strategic and executive initiatives as they are being worked on. The portal is used for both preparing new policies and reviewing policy drafts during the policy-making process.

# Consultation Portal on Climate/Environmental Issues (Consultation Action 2)

Concurrently with the Citizens' Convention on climate issues, we open the Consultation Portal and thus allow not only those who attend the Citizens' Convention, but all citizens to enter their ideas on how carbon neutrality could be achieved. It is possible to open several consultation cases to call for opinions based on themes.

The ideas and opinions submitted through the Consultation Portal will be compiled in a report along with the results of the Citizens' Convention, which will be sent to the City Council for processing.

# Resident Councils

Reykjavík City resident councils are an active collaboration platform for dialogue between residents, the district grassroots, non-profit organizations, the economy, and City officials.

The resident councils are designed to strengthen the connection and shorten communication channels between residents and Reykjavík's administration, and to enable residents to express their views. There are active resident councils in all districts of Reykjavík. Each resident council consists of three representatives elected by the City Council, one representative of the parent associations in the district, one representative of the resident associations in the district and one randomly selected representative. The resident councils meet once a month, their meetings are generally open to all citizens, and they are streamed live on Reykjavík City's website.

There will be a focus on internal communication with staff of 10.000 people, including workplaces with a close relationship to citizens such as schools, kindergartens, libraries, museums, swimming pools etc. Various ways are available and will be used through the communications of the CCC, such as through Torgið (the Square – and educational digital space), Workplace and in collaboration with Green steps, an internal environment management system which has been running since 2011

# Outlook and Next Steps

## Plans for Next CCC and CCC Action Plan Iteration

### Portfolio management and execution

A consultation platform will be created for the participants in the CCC, and how the actions will be implemented. It is also necessary to formulate how the actions will be implemented within the City of Reykjavík. The City of Reykjavík will build on the results and recommendations made after a meeting held with EIT Climate-KIC with key stakeholders on collaboration with entrepreneurs and innovators. as input into policy making and action plans in the fields of innovation and digitalization.

### Citizens

The preparation of the Citizen's Assembly on climate issues must begin after the CCC has been approved, as well as other projects related to democratic participation (listed in Section C).

### Presentation

The CCC will be well presented to the City of Reykjavík's staff and preparations must be made for how the presentation will be carried out when the CCC is approved.

### Monitoring and reflexive process

The current monitoring on actions in the RGD is made by the Mayor's office and takes place twice a year, resulting in a report discussed by the City executive Council Executive committee and published on Reykjavik's website. The envisioned monitoring on actions in the CCC is to include them as part of the RGD actions and part of that reporting process.

The envisioned reflexive process is that there will be an annual meeting with participants of the CCC and the Mayor, discussing the status of the GHG emissions, current actions and possible future actions. The meeting will take place after publishing the GHG inventory, which is published in October or November each year. The status of the emissions is the measure of whether this work is actually reducing GHG emissions. Other indicators will be published at the same time, such as indicators related to health, equality and biodiversity. For CCC actions that are new, and not already incorporated in either the businesses or national government's carbon neutrality goals, we will form small working groups, each including a specific contact person from the CCC group to formulate the action and put it into practice.

The actions will develop, and it is expected that participants will be added and thus the number of actions will increase. Those changes will be recorded and the CCC will be developed so that it can be updated every 2 years until 2030. Municipal elections will be held in 2026 and the CCC will be iterated with the majority and Mayor after the elections.

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

# 1 Introduction

The City of Reykjavík has been ambitious in climate issues since the first Climate Policy was published in 2009. Subsequently, the City sought to be a member of the Covenant of Mayors in 2011, and in 2016 a policy was set to become carbon neutral by 2040. Two detailed Action Plans have since been published. It was in continuation of this ambition that it was decided to participate in applying to be one of the 112 cities in the European Co-operation for carbon-neutral and smart cities in 2030. By this, the City of Reykjavík speeding up the goal by a decade, and it is clear that the goal can only be achieved with the participation of several parties.

A lot has happened since the first Climate Policy was established. The highlights of the journey have been focusing not only on GHG emissions but on co-benefits of climate actions. People become healthier as the city becomes denser, has more infrastructure for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport. At the same time, this makes the city more welcoming for existing and new businesses and tourists, which strengthens the economy and increases the use of local renewable energy by supporting charging stations for cars and electric bikes.

Participation in the mission has given the City even more opportunities to participate in international projects related to climate change and to learn from other cities. The city is both a Pilot City and a Twin City city regarding projects related to transportation issues and changing travel habits. The working group that has worked on the preparation of the contract has gained an insight into the different aspects of various divisions and what it is like to work across issues in the City.

A political steering group has led the policy formulation of the project and it includes the leaders of all parties, including the leaders of the minority. A working group with employees from different divisions within the City has worked to prepare the first draft of the contract on behalf of the steering committee. The employees are from the Department of Environment and Planning, the Office of the Mayor and Chief Administrative Officer, the Human Rights and Democracy Office and from the Finance Department.

The participants in this first Climate City Contract submit actions that are being worked on. The Mayor is responsible for the contract, where the participants undertake to submit one or more actions, which are being worked on to reduce the effects of climate change. The contract is according to specifications from Net Zero Cities, which manages the project on behalf of the European Union. The European Commission reviews the contract and approves or rejects it. This is a long-term project, where the contract must be renewed regularly and the status reviewed up to the year 2030.

# 2 Goal: Climate Neutrality by 2030

When the goal of carbon neutrality in 2040 was set, the thinking was that the year 2030 would be a touchstone on the way and a certain measure of success. The goal for 2030 was to reduce emissions by 300,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalents until 2030, which corresponded to a 60% reduction from 2019. The minimum requirement from NetZero Cities of at least 80% reduction is therefore very challenging. The mission enables the City to accelerate the climate neutrality ambition and to introduce stakeholders outside the City to participate with their actions to support the City to be climate neutral by 2030.

The 2040 target on carbon neutrality included emissions within BASIC+ (Scope 1, 2 and 3 in the waste sector) but the new 2030 climate neutrality target will be expanded and include Scope 3 emissions as well, as there are considerable emissions from building materials for new construction within city boundaries. The target is to meet the requirements of the mission and reduce the emissions by 80% of the greenhouse gases emitted in 2019. The target will cover the entire administrative territory of the City, as it has done since the first Climate Action Plan was made in 2016.

As previously mentioned, the biggest carbon footprint by far is from road transport. A change in transport habits and the energy transition of the car fleet are therefore of great importance to achieving carbon neutrality. Electricity in Iceland is produced with local hydro and geothermal sources. With less reliance on fossil fuels in transportation, the country and Reykjavik as well will be more energy independent and use renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels.

Iceland could be the first fossil fuel free country in the world. If the fossil fuel use of transportation would be solved, we would rely 100% on renewable energy for all primary energy. This would give Reykjavik and Iceland a unique selling point to attract businesses, visitors and new inhabitants.

Fossil fuels do emit other gases than greenhouse gases which affect air quality. To enhance other modes of travel than by car, the people in Reykjavik are more likely to adopt an active lifestyle which will benefit individual health.

There are no ETS facilities within the geographical boundary of the city.

Reykjavik has the target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2030, with 2019 as a baseline year with a just, nature-based transition in mind. As it stands in this first CCC, that target will not be met. Until the renewal of the CCC, we will work with stakeholders to find ways to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach the target of 80% reduction. Work will also be done to put forward proposals on how best to deal with carbon offsets, if it is not possible to close the gap by 2030 by other means.

# 3 Strategic Priorities

Strategic priorities are to include stakeholders who are already working on ambitious climate related actions and are willing to participate in the actions in this first CCC.

The focus for the next 2-3 years will be following up on ambitious plans from both Reykjavik City and the stakeholders who will commit to this first CCC. Critical stakeholders to accelerate change are the signatories at this first CCC in Section 5.

## 3.1.1.1 Key Strategic Priorities:

Mobility, focus on change in travel modes and strengthening the infrastructure for public transport, pedestrians and cyclists.
Energy transition of the car fleet and at the port of Reykjavík with carbon neutral produced energy
Waste and circular economy, including increased recycling by the private sector and individuals.
Building sector. The City has ambitious goals for the development of residential housing. It is therefore important that this development has as little impact on the climate and environment as possible.
Just transition – Various ways to ensure a just transition are already in place at the City of Reykjavík and are described in detail in the Action Plan.

# 4 Process and Principles

The key principles will be on co-creation, just transition, multi-level governance approaches, working with stakeholders and citizen engagement. As before, GHG emissions in the city will be measured and published through the CDP portal.

The systemic process the City will undertake to achieve its 2030 climate neutrality target is to involve a larger group of stakeholders than before. A review of the actions in this first CCC will be done in collaboration with the participants. Work will be done to add participants, and thus actions in the next version of the CCC, so that it is more likely that the goal of carbon neutrality in 2030 will be achieved.

We will work with the participants on how best to communicate information and share success stories. An annual meeting with participants could be one way to do that.

To promote transparency, the City of Reykjavík itself will have a website where the contract will be published. It will also describe the progress of the actions and what they will deliver by the end of September 2025 and 2026.

In addition to actions that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, emphasis will continue to be placed on climate change adaptation. We will continue to develop nature-based solutions, including blue-green surface water solutions, and work in line with the City's policy on biodiversity. Work on the Green Plan's vision of Reykjavik being a prosperous, fun and healthy city will continue. Reykjavik, which previously planned to become carbon neutral by 2040, now plans to work with others to become carbon neutral and smart by 2030.
