# Summary

The City Climate contract (CCC) is set up as a way for Cities to identify pathways towards climate neutrality and backing them up with the necessary actions (part B-2), (financial) means (Investment Plan) and the necessary commitments from our local stakeholders (Commitments part). Its format is designed to address all aspects which are needed to be successful; current emissions (module A-1) forecasting (A-2.5), systemic barriers and opportunities (A-3) monitoring and learning (B-3), and strategizing the next steps (module C)

In 2019 we identified and established the pathways (current policies, Module A-2) for the main emission domains (Energy, Build Environment, Mobility and Port &amp; Industry) and creating a portfolio of actions (Annex 1, 2) with our local stakeholders (Commitments section) which resulted in the Rotterdam Climate agreement (Rotterdams Klimaatakkoord). The aim was to have an impact which would contribute sufficiently to reduce our CO2-emission in 2030 with 49% compared to 1990 and become climate neutral in 2050. In 2022 this goal was raised to -55% in and in 2023 we created our first a climate action plan (Klimaatactieplan Rotterdam) to monitor progress.

An important part of our portfolio is the result of multilevel cooperation (A-2), specifically the actions that were the result of the national Climate Agreement (2019). This is almost mandatory, because municipalities in the Netherlands are currently insufficiently (A-3.2, 3.5) in a position to decide on their own on the necessary regulatory and financial (fiscal, lending and spending) means to ensure the necessary actions can be executed. We are dependent on other state actors, especially the Dutch government, in creating the necessary enabling conditions for actions to be locally executed. This means we are continuously prone to negotiate on the basis of subsidiarity and proportionality who can, must and is in the best position to act.

Forecasting annually the impact of our actions, has ever since shown (Module A 2.5) we are not on track yet towards the 2030 goal. Beside focusing on getting the current portfolio executed, addressing the barriers we encountered along the way, we continuously look for new ways and possible actions to bridge the gap. Introducing innovative ways (A 3.3.) to update our portfolio of actions locally with our citizens and other stakeholders. But the impact of actions we can decide upon on our own, is limited compared to what can be done when working together with other state actors.

But the reality is that many barriers (A-3) still need to be addressed, for which the national government and EU are in the best position. On top, new barriers have presented themselves (grid congestion, investment stop heating companies), which endangers the execution of our current actions.

This makes it very difficult to envisage a scenario which leads towards bridging the gap in 2030, let alone state a more ambitious feasible target, as has been assessed when we applied for this mission in March 2022 (Expression of Interest). Because for enabling the scaling and speeding up some of our main impactful actions, the same barriers have to be addressed which threaten our current actions. While we do wat we can within our sphere of influence, there are not many other ways available to address certain emissions, especially those aimed at the built environment.

Faced with this reality we are starting to look beyond 2030. We use the moment of the submission of this CCC (module C) as a start for the preparations for the next administration, which will be installed after the elections March 2026. This means for this year we focus on ensuring that our current portfolio of actions will be executed, and the barriers are addressed so the next administration is able to assess 1) what can still be done towards 2030, 2) which intermediate goals to set after 2030, and 3) offer them a portfolio of possible actions and 4) an investment plan to back it up. The introduction will show this has been our practice since 2018.
Another reason for this course of action are the **multilevel processes** we are dependent upon to determine a feasible pathway and/or shape our portfolio: the preparation of new national measures by the national government to (still) reach the national goal in 2030, as well establishing a goal for 2035 as obligated to do by the national Climate Law. Also, the negotiations on the proposed EU target of -90% in 2040 will have its impact to be reckoned with.

Because of this multilevel dependency we express the wish to use this mission to the fullest for our preparations, utilising the support of the European Commission as well as that of the national support structure (A3, C). Our submission is therefore a confirmation of our dedication, with the support of our local stakeholders (commitments), towards the overall goal of achieving climate neutral cities, being aware (A-2,3) that none of us can achieve it on its own (B-3? Energy, stakeholder analysis).

The way in which the European Commission has set up this mission and the way of reporting, informed and supported by NetZeroCities consortium, to achieve a baseline for bridging the gap between local Climate action and the European Union (part B), leads us to believe and assess this mission can give cities such as Rotterdam the chance to address the structural and systemic barriers (part A-3), in which the EU has a chance to act, which are prevent us in achieving the goal (introduction, A-3) to become a climate neutral city on time.

Only together we can make a climate neutral city happen!

# Introduction

Rotterdam is a city with 600.000 inhabitants. That's makes us the second largest city in the Netherlands. It is a multi-cultural city with inhabitants from 172 different nationalities. On average we also have the poorest inhabitants compared to the other big cities, which makes an inclusive and affordable energy transition for us of the utmost importance.

Within our municipal boundaries is located the Port of Rotterdam, the biggest port in Europe. The industry and energy sector located there is responsible for roughly  $20\%$  of the national CO2-emissions and  $80\%$  of the Rotterdam emissions (both scope 1). If we also take in consideration the vast amount goods produced there or passing through, the port plays a large role in emissions produced elsewhere.  $13\%$  of all energy consumed in Europe passes through the port and indirect emissions (scope3) amount to almost 3,5 times of the total emissions of the Netherlands. The transformation of the port towards a clean energy and sustainable resource hub is therefore of strategic importance for the future of our city, the Netherlands and Europe as a whole.

Rotterdam is a dense urban area with a negligible amount of farming land. This has several consequences. First, there are but a few areas where large scale wind- or solar farms can be developed. This makes us almost completely dependent, currently and in the future, of the development of sustainable electricity sources beyond our city borders. Next, while there is potential for the development and utilising of local heat sources, for a large part we are dependent on residual heat from industrial processes in the Port of Rotterdam. Emphasizing the strategic importance of this transition for the city area. Third, the extra space required for the energy transition, because of all the extra assets required, causes many issues with other challenges which also demand space, like greening the city, housing, etc.

Multi-level cooperation on different scales (regional, national, European and international) is therefore of vital essence in reaching our ambitions on climate neutrality. Depending on our sphere of influence we fulfil different roles and responsibilities in the many transitions that are taking place in our city borders.

The EU Mission "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030" aims to support the transformation of cities to accelerate the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and to be both a catalyst and driver for the implementation of the European Green Deal, as well as a demonstrator that it is possible to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Rotterdam shares this ambition, convinced that only multi-level cooperation and coordination, between different layers of governments and stakeholders, is crucial to reach a climate neutral society on time AND to open up new/smart possibilities for the much-needed acceleration. Because the reality unfortunately is that we are still not on track to reach the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement to keep the rise of global temperature at $1,5\%$ C at the end of his century. As a low-lying city in the Dutch river delta, vulnerable to the effects of climate change, this is almost an existential problem.

We believe cities, where most people live and work who will face the effect of climate change and climate policies, must become more involved in the shaping of policies and actions by the EU and national governments. We see ourselves as crucial actors in informing them to achieve better policies, better regulations, better spending, and better execution of climate action. Because of our focus on learning-by-doing in an integral (holistic) way, we can give valuable insights into the challenges and barriers to address so to have a bigger and quicker impact on climate change. In a way that is also sensible to all the other public challenges cities face.

The Mission Implementation Plan foresees that each of the 100 selected cities will develop a City Climate Contract (CCC) adapted to its own reality, through a process of co-creation and in close collaboration with the whole of civil society and citizens, detailing the strategy for the deployment and monitoring of innovative and digital solutions to achieve climate neutrality; and enabling other cities to follow their example by 2050. The CCC consist of three elements: a Climate Neutrality Action Plan, an Investment Plan and a Commitments document expressing the necessary support of all the local stakeholders for the previous. Rotterdam can by experience state that these are crucial elements for reaching one's goals, having worked on variations of them and all the necessary elements it has to contain, for at least the last five years.

Since we set our first target of -49% CO2-reduction for 2030 in 2019, and drafted the first plans to achieve it, the focus for Rotterdam has been on getting the desired results. We took a step-by-step approach, learning while doing approach, since so many things had to be done for the first time with no prior experience. Innovation is therefore a key element. We perceive this as the only way to discover the effectiveness of our actions; learning which preconditions are needed for scaling them up to the point a feasible pathway towards the 2030 goal and beyond can be established.

In essence, our climate policy has slowly been shifting, from what can be done within the existing context to have the biggest CO2-reduction on the short and intermediate term, towards what in the end is needed to become a climate neutral city. This practically means, that no matter how big or how small the emissions are, for every person or business a viable pathway must be created towards NetZero. Which leads to the necessity of more structural changes of which we are beginning to experience the signs.

Rotterdam has been engaging on many ways in different networks for the last decades to share our experiences and stimulate further collaboration, especially between cities globally and within the European Union. We are happy to observe that so many of the selected cities, especially also the ones in the Netherlands, have already submitted their CCC's, which unlocks a huge amount of useful information. With the mission we hope we can transcend beyond sharing only experiences and opinions toward real collaboration and collective multi-level action.

We are confident this document shows a clear political commitment, to the European Commission and national, regional and local authorities, towards the goal of climate neutrality. It secondly demonstrates that our common mission cannot succeed without being firmly anchored in the local community and garnering broad support, for which municipalities are the best equipped to organise. But thirdly, it clearly demonstrates that cities like Rotterdam,

8
especially in the Dutch context, cannot reach this tremendous task on its own and strengthening our multi-level cooperation is indispensable. And for last, we are arguing that constantly pressing innovation (specially digitalisation), learning-while-doing, should be at the centre of that cooperation so to be able to scale and speed up this transition towards climate neutral cities.

# The Rotterdam City Climate Contract

In this section we provide an overview of all the prior steps we have taken (not exhaustingly) and how they relate towards this CCC.

Rotterdam has been taking the steps advocated by this mission prior to the launch of the EU-mission in terms of understanding the system, building a mandate, shaping the right policies and actions, increasing our capacity to (imp)act and learning, evaluating, reassessing our course of action. Rotterdam and the mission therefore seemed to us a clear fit when it was announced in 2021.

Since the Rotterdam Climate Agreement (RKA, 2019) and our first and forecasting, assessing the impact of our climate actions, we have been going through many phases of learning, evaluating, and adapting our approach with our stakeholders, which we see as one of the key elements of this mission.

We will first give an overview of the steps taken prior to creating this CCC, our lessons learned, after which we will elaborate on the current situation, to end with an overview of the consequences for the different parts and sections of the CCC.

## Prior steps

In 2018, at the start of the new administrative period when the new City Council was installed, the following actions were taken:

Scenarios and pathways: We did our first **backcasting** of possible pathways towards climate neutrality (**Nieuwe Energie voor Rotterdam**, Drift). Giving us insight towards which pathways and actions should and/or could be established.
Investments: Our first assessment was made (Meerjarenperspectief Energietransitie) of the necessary investments and expenditures until 2030 (see Investment Plan).
Budget and funding: an Energy Transition Budget (ETB) was set up to finance the necessary actions and an Energy Transition Fund (ETF) was set-up for providing low-interest loans.
Goals: The newly installed City Council officially adopted the goal of reaching **climate neutrality** in 2050 and reducing the emissions within its boundaries in 2030 by 49%. This was agreed upon with the Council Agreement on Energy Transition (Raadsakkoord Energietransitie, 2019). It identified 5 ‘**transition pathways**’ to succeed in towards climate neutrality (Port &amp; Industry, Built Environment, Mobility, Energy-production, and the Economic transition).
Commitments: We established our first **Rotterdam Climate Agreement (RKA)** in 2019 were local stakeholders endorsed the overall climate goals and agreed upon 49 climate deals to reach those goals. An important part was also to implement the tasks set out in the National Climate agreement (2019). More than 50 meetings were held with the participation of more than 100 companies and organisations and over 1000 citizens. The climate deals touched on a variety of issues, big and small, not limited to CO2-reduction but also on for example consumption/circularity and the labour market. So called ‘Climate tables’ were established for the various emission domains to monitor progress and inspire new actions.
Monitoring and Forecasting: Besides keeping track of our CO2-emissions, we started with forecasting annually the CO2-impact of our actions, so to be able to track progress and identify the **emission-gap** to be targeted with new measures and actions. The first forecast showed we were (and still do) not on track and had an emission-gap in 2030 based on the city-wide goal of -49%. In addition, we classified the status of our actions in **degrees of certainty**, reflecting the progress of actions and giving us insight into additional actions needed to assure more certainty.
Governance: the Department of Sustainability was set up to coordinate and instigate sustainability in the centre of our municipal organisation.

In 2022, when the current administrative period started, the following changes have since occurred:

Scenario's, and investments: An analysis was performed of the available (policy) options and cost to reduce the 'emission gap', with a baseline of -55% in 2030 (see investment plan)
Goals: The new administration adopted a goal of -55% CO2 (scope 1) in 2030 as well as setting a more specific goal for the urban area (excluding the port) because based on the analysis there the municipality has (more) ways for action. Concretely this was set at -25% (scope 1+2) in 2026, which marks the end of the current administrative period.
Commitments: the set-up of the governance of the Rotterdam Climate Agreement with five 'Climatetables' was changed. This was because many collaborations with local stakeholders had evolved into more sector-specific agreements and action plans and business-as-usual practises (see Commitments). We followed-up with installing 'Climateboosters' (Klimaataanjagers), local persons who's task is to build upon the networks established since the RKA, focussing on those areas were we perceived a gap and chances for strengthening stakeholder collaboration.
Budget and Funding: the ETB was followed up by the Sustainability Transition Budget (DTB) to allow more actions to be funded than those focussed solely on the energy transition.
Democracy and participation: to get our citizens more involved into the decision-making processes on climate action, the step was taken to assemble a Citizens Council on Climate (Burgerberaad Klimaat) which consist of randomly selected citizens who reflect the Rotterdam population. After working half a year, their advice on further climate action is now ready to be debated by the City Council. In addition, 37 Neighbourhood Councils were established so to involve our citizens on a more local scale in matters which are a concern to them, including climate action.
Pathways and actions: we started working on our first Climate Action Plan (Klimaatactieplan Rotterdam, KAR) which was adopted (by the City Council in April 2023. Our focus was first of all to create a digital, user-friendly tool to monitor our overall progress towards climate neutrality and assess and discuss with our City Council and local stakeholders, further actions needed to reach our goals as well as the related barriers. It created the first comprehensive overview of all the goals, pathways, progress, and barriers from the different policies contributing to climate action.

## Current situation: from start-up to scale-up

We are experiencing the transition from the start-up to a scale-up phase in various ways, being confronted with systemic barriers which are too large to be overcome by Rotterdam alone and require multi-level stakeholder cooperation on many fronts. Some of the barriers have a huge impact in the feasibility of current policies and plans.

The most pressing barriers on the short and intermediate term are:

Grid congestion: due to the quicker than expected electrification due to the gas crisis, the capacity of the electricity grid is insufficient to allow new users, in first instance big electricity users. Due to the time it takes to upgrade it, this problem will not be solved before 2030, while congestion management and other measures can only partly compensate.
District Heating: the current two private owned compagnies who are responsible for the district heating network in Rotterdam have stopped investing because the

1
national government has eventually decided that district heating (or other collective heating systems) must (eventually) be exploited by publicly owned compagnies. This had not only led to a delay in the planned expansion of district heating but also prevents us from discussing and preparing with them new ambitious plans. Since the law is still not decided upon by the parliament, there is currently a lot of uncertainty about how exactly to proceed with our current plans for expanding the network.

Labour shortages: while scaling up measures and actions, increasingly we are observing at our stakeholders they are having problems in finding at time the right specialized staff. When we are trying to scale-up our ambitions and actions, we expect this to be an increasing bottleneck for drawing up and executing plans.

The short conclusion is that we are forced to reassess and adapt our current plans and actions, since these barriers affect almost all the planning of actions in our current portfolio which depend on the energy system.

## Fulfilling of the CCC-requirements

Creating a CCC is meant to be supportive of our local needs, going through different phases, learning adapting, updating and shaped by local experiences. The CCC the mission stimulates cities to assess their current impact, learn from other cities, and strategies with their local stakeholders how to bridge the gap towards climate neutrality by new actions. This should lead to a portfolio of actions which are backed up by an investment plan and the necessary commitments. Reflecting on that ambition and approach we have the following remarks.

On the ambition of accelerating towards net zero:

Since 2019 we have adopted a resilient, flexible, no regret approach (see section A-3). Reduction measures taken here and now are assessed and determined by looking at the desired outcomes for a climate neutral city, by 2050. Because the amount of money needed, we also try to prevent having investments done on the short term, which are redundant or cause an undesirable lock-in at the long term (see A-3 Energy), preventing unnecessary cost. If we all are pressed to accelerate, which is a possibility, we should address this issue. And achieving the goal via unorthodox measures (e.g. compensation with carbon credits), also questions whether we will be a feasible example for other cities.

When the mission was launched, we stated in our expression of interest that the ask to become climate neutral in 2030 was not feasible for Rotterdam. Being conscious already of our impact and progress towards 2030, we could assess that the goal of climate neutrality, even with unlimited resources, many other barriers (socio-economic, technological, organisational, environmental etc) cannot be overcome/changed in such a very short timeframe. For some sectors, like the built environment, it will already be a challenge to reach 2050 on time, because of the labour intensity and operational complexity. Innovation is therefore a necessary part of our mission, to create new possibilities to accelerate and overcome barriers.

On the other hand, our experiences and insights do stress the utmost importance and need of strengthening multilevel cooperation AND coordination to be able to tackle the barriers we face. So, we decided to join with the focus on creating new means to accelerate this transition towards climate neutrality.

We see ourselves as a frontrunner in taking risk and changes, going through the first experiences, paying our tuition fee, and experience at fists hand what's needed for the tasks ahead, being insightful for other cities and government bodies before they are confronted with these tasks.

Coherence and completeness:
Building upon our locale experiences, over time, when climate action is proliferating across multiple stakeholders and policies, as we are experiencing, it will be very difficult to establish one moment, as submitting this CCC, in which all the elements can be complete, coherent and also up to date. This is due to several factors:

Climate Neutrality effects almost all (policy) areas: It takes time to integrate and establish a meaningful relationship between all the different elements. Awareness of the links between multiple areas/systems and naming them in policies is one thing, but to act upon them is another one. Since the impact of climate action and the awareness of its effect upon others is increasing with a tremendous speed, the learning curve is steep and established policies and actions are quickly outdated.

Purpose in place and time: most of the products (analyses, visions, policies, actions, etc) are established at a specific phase and time when the situation demanded it. It depends also on the subject matter; infrastructural change has a longer timespan than social ones. Also, most of the time one product is a stepping stone to progress towards the next step. Currently it is also labour intensive and sometimes requires external expertise to update some of the elements requested in the CCC. This is an important reason why we invest so much in digitalisation and data, so it becomes easier to keep them up to date and ensure that relationships are not broken or overlooked.

Unpredictable and unforeseen factors: the geopolitical situation like the war in the Ukraine and its effect on energy prices &amp; strategy, the global COVID-epidemic, are a few recent examples with a big impact which forced us to adapt, re-strategies and act upon. Other not to foreseen developments, like the recent occurrence of grid congestion (insufficient capacity of the electricity network), causes us to readjust the planning of a numerous actions which were contributing to our current established pathways.

UN, EU, Regional Government(s): the establishment of new goals/targets and the actions/measures taken by other multilevel governmental stakeholders have a huge impact on how our local policies are shaped. Especially the intermediate goals that are set for CO2-reduction for the different emission domains and the policies to reach them. This arises partly from the huge dependency of municipalities in the Netherlands on the national government in terms of having enough regulatory power and/or funding. Consequently, we sometimes have to wait before it becomes clear which policies and actions we locally can and must take. Although we try to anticipate upon them, this brings uncertainties and risk we must manage.

Elections: all of our citizens have the right to periodically express their political priorities, which can impact earlier established goals, policies, plans and budget. Apart from the effect of other governmental elections (for example the recent decisions by the new government to build extra nuclear power plants, or not set through the plan to obligate hybrid heath pumps) we have the custom (see Prior Steps) to decide on new goals and ambitions, which also require extra budget, at the beginning of each new administrative period.

The content of the previous sections has led us to make the following considerations and choices for the purpose of this CCC:

Scope: we decided to focus in the CCC on the energy transition in the city, excluding targeting the emissions of the Port of Rotterdam area where the industry and the (fossil) energy sector is present. Observing the progress so far and being conscious of the limited influence of the municipality compared to the leading role of the national government and role of the EU, it's questionable whether the mission in its current approach and set-up is the right vehicle for change. We also do not include circular (scope3), biodiversity or climate adaptation goals and policies, unless in relationship with the energy transition. While they are of utmost importance, we are choosing to go for coherence instead of being overly complete for the purpose of this CCC and the mission in general. This can

3
change in the future in relationship to the establishment and/or progress of other missions.

Goals: for 2030 no intermediate goal has yet been set specific for the city, besides the overall -55% for the whole city. Regarding climate neutrality, these has been one set for mobility for 2040 and for the rest, mainly the Built environment in 2050. The moment of submitting this CCC coincides with
a) the preparation of the incoming administration in 2026
b) the preparation of new national measures by the national government to (still) reach the national goal in 2030, as well establishing a goal for 2035 as obligated to do by the national Climate Law, and
c) the negotiations on the proposed EU target of -90% in 2040.
This al has led us to the conclusion it is prudent to use the CCC as a starting point of preparation for the new administration, giving them the opportunity to establish an ambitious but feasible target with the further support this mission offers. To prepare, it's in our situation of utmost importance we can take these multilevel developments into consideration when we strategies what is wise. As we did in preparation for the current and previous administration, we are starting now to prepare new scenario's, policy options and an estimate of the needed investments. For this CCC, we still maintain the -55% as a benchmark to define the 'emission gap'.
In addition, many of the current policies and associated action plans are set to contribute towards a target set for 2030, while some even stop in 2026. As a consequence, policies targeting the emissions beyond, for a big part are in the middle in the process of being updated, which are essential in complementing our portfolio of actions for the periods beyond. The earlier mentioned barriers on the short term also forces us to reevaluate and update certain policies.

Pathways: Since the admission of the CCC is for a part meant as an evaluation moment, an analysis has taken place to identify which pathways were not addressed in our KAR (as shown in section B). We performed a 'gap analysis', identifying the consistency between our policies, identified pathways and actions. On basis of the results, we have realigned our current pathways and added new ones as input for the policy shaping process. This will guide us further into updating our KAR (with new pathways, establishing intermediate and end goals, actions, stakeholder engagement and investments) in preparation for the incoming administration.

Portfolio of actions: our current portfolio of actions is part of the baseline. Therefore, we did not (yet) classify them in terms of levers of change and represent them in B-2, but as part of our current Climate Action Plan Rotterdam (KAR, Annex 1). As stated earlier, we are still dealing with a gap in 2030 based on the effect of our current portfolio of actions. We did not present a portfolio of actions capable of targeting this gap, since the only available options concerns scaling up current ones, where barriers prevent them now.

Based on the gap analysis we did encounter established pathways without established actions, which need further exploring before they can be established as part of our portfolio of actions, as listed the KAR.

For the purpose of giving insight on how we determined our effect in 2030, we provided the project list in Annex 2.

To summarise, this means this version Climate Neutrality Action Plan now consist of an:

Evaluation of our current KAR and ways to improve its monitoring of current pathways
Supplementing the missing information not included in the KAR such as the forecast, policies and barriers.
The beginning of a process to create a comprehensive portfolio of actions which addresses the remaining city's urban emissions in preparation for the next administration, starting next year.

4
For the Investment Plan this means that no extensive portfolio of new actions in this version can be provided to build upon which are directed towards CO2-impact.

Lastly, we would very much want to explore ways to make the process of CCC more digital so to allow more automated updates. We ourselves are continuously improving the KAR in this way so to digitally integrate more working process. For the purpose for this CCC we now had to deconstruct it to a document version (Annex 1). At this moment we are using digital tools and are developing them (e.g. apps for programme and project leaders) to allow more integral and automatic updated, generated and/or real-time information on the development and progress of the various policies, pathways and actions. A working group of the city Council is also involved and thinking about ways to align our KAR with the budget and investment monitoring and planning. At the end we think digitalisation is vital for quicker and more effective climate action, by contributing to multi-level stakeholder cooperation and coordination. Let's get digital!

## Reading guide

In part A we present

An overview and assessment of the current and historic development of our emissions, which have been monitored since 2007. It covers the emissions of the whole city (scope 1) and is specific for the urban area (scope 1+2). It will provide insight into the sphere of influence we as a city have related to the need for multi-level cooperation and action.
An overview of our current Climate (mitigating) policies and their relationship with the policies and actions of European, national and regional governments. We first of all use this part to provide insight into which local pathways and actions were established and instigated by others, and which are a result of engagement locally, in addition and/or needed for an effective implementation. Second, we sum up the main upcoming changes and updates of multilevel policies which will impact or upon which we are dependent for updating our current policies.
An overview and analyses of the impact and therefore changes the transition towards a climate neutral city demands from various sectors/functions/systems which are part of our city. We will highlight the most perceived opportunities and barriers. To conclude with mentioning the enablers for climate action and the perceived opportunities and barriers.

Part A – Current State of Climate Action

Part A “Current State of Climate Action” describes our current point of departure towards climate neutrality, and how with local stakeholders we progressed so far, which informs the subsequent modules and the outlined pathways to accelerated climate action.

We will first touch on our current CO2-emissions and offer an analysis of the factors responsible for its development. In the second module we present our current policies and those of other layers of government and show its forecasted effect in 2030. To end this section with the third module in which we analyse the main barriers and opportunities to address so to achieve a climate neutral city on time.

[these are also regularly updated and reported via the C40/CDP network and in order to annually update the Climate Action Plan, but not with the extensive analysis.]

Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

A-1.1. Methodology

Scopes and approach

The scope of emissions includes all direct CO2 emissions (scope 1 of the internationally used calculation for greenhouse gas emissions, the GHG Protocol) and, in addition, indirect CO2 emissions (scope 2) for the urban environment. Chain effects (scope 3) are disregarded on this moment.

Rotterdam has committed to the national climate goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 55 percent in 2030 compared to 1990. And ultimately Rotterdam wants to be climate neutral by 2050. Rotterdam therefore wants to monitor the total CO2 emissions in Rotterdam, i.e. both city and port. This only concerns scope 1, conform the national target for emissions.

Rotterdam wants more focus on the urban environment in reducing CO2 emissions. The (vice-) mayors have has established a CO2 target minus 25% CO2 reduction by 2025 for the urban area, measured against 1990.

The two goals set by Rotterdam require different approaches:

The source approach for the target for total city and port emissions. The source approach is similar to scope 1. It includes emissions from fossil combustion from all sources within the municipal boundaries, such as gas consumption in a home or business, or gasoline use from a car.
The user approach for the mayors target, which covers only the urban part of the municipality. The user approach includes scope 1 and scope 2. Scope 2 refers to the use of delivered electricity or heat in this area. The CO2 emissions associated with the production and use of that electricity and heat are allocated to the user. Examples include an office using the heat grid, or electricity use by the subway or an electric car.

Classification into sectors

The breakdown by sectors and subsectors follows the classification used by the national Regional Climate Monitor. The sectors are built environment, mobility, industry, energy and agriculture. Trends by sector are added in graph form for the period 2014-2023.

The focus in is mainly on the urban area, because the municipality has more opportunities to influence emissions there and a mayors target has been set for this purpose.

Other greenhouse gases

The other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases) are not considered here. Data on these are of limited reliability at the local level and the contribution of such greenhouse gases is expected to be limited in Rotterdam.

# Data sources and reliability of figures

The total figure for 2023 is a preliminary figure. The figures for industry and the energy sector come from the electronic annual environmental reports of the individual companies. Corrections for emissions were made for some companies that use biogenic raw materials as fuels or for combustion in processes, in accordance with international agreements on calculating CO2 emissions. The emissions of the companies can be considered final; they are rarely adjusted afterwards. They comprise about 90% of Rotterdam's total CO2 emissions.

Road traffic emissions are based on local data on numbers of vehicles and kilometers driven on the various parts of the Rotterdam road network and national emission factors for different types of vehicles and speeds.

The other figures come from the Regional Climate Monitor (RKM) of the Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management and from the Emissions Registration (ER). There is a delay of one (RKM) to sometimes two (ER) years in the availability of these figures. Estimates for the last year are therefore based on key figures, national trends or provisionally equal to those of the previous year.

For ER figures for mobile sources, such as shipping, relatively large retrospective corrections can be made. Such figures are based on models that are regularly adjusted (improved). For this reason, the total figure for 2023 will be adjusted in the coming year. This normally involves corrections of at most 1-2% of total emissions in Rotterdam. Figures from models from the national ER, such as for shipping and agriculture, can be changed up to five years later.

To avoid the suggestion of high accuracy, figures are preferably expressed in megatons (Mton). For smaller numbers, the text is rounded to tens of kilotons (kton) of CO2. In tables, the "exact" number in kton is given

## A-1.2. Analysis of current and historic emissions

This section contains an explanation of Rotterdam's CO2 emissions for 2023, the extent of emissions from the various sectors and sources, the differences with emissions in 2022 and an estimate of emissions in 2024. The emissions are tested against the two Rotterdam climate targets.

Emissions urban area
![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)
Figure 2 Emissions for the urban part of Rotterdam compared to the 2025 target.

The city's CO2 emissions in 2023 are 2.37 Mton. This includes both scope 1 and scope. It covers all emissions from the built environment and the urban part of mobility. Emissions in 2023 are  $31\%$  lower than emissions in 1990. In 2025, emissions may still reach a maximum of 2.58 Mton to achieve the mayors target of  $25\%$  in 2025. With the 2023 emissions, the city's target would already be achieved.

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)
Figure 3 Share for urban sectors, built environment and mobility, by scope.

The share of urban mobility in scope 2 is limited; the other three sectors are similar in order of magnitude.
By 2023, total CO2 emissions will be 23.1 Mton, falling below 1990 levels (23.7 Mton). The goal is a reduction of at least 55% compared to 1990 emissions and thus a maximum of 10.7 Mton in 2030. The distance to the goal be carries 12.4 Mton.

Emissions in 2023 of 23.1 Mton represent 2.4 Mton (9%) lower emissions than in 2022. CO2 emissions in the Netherlands in 2023 are 123.2 Mt. Thus, emissions in Rotterdam are 19% of national emissions.

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)
Figure 4. Trend scope 1 CO2 emission Rotterdam.

Figure 4 shows the trend of CO2 emissions in Rotterdam for the period 2014 - 2023. The increases and decreases in this period are mainly determined by the fossil energy sector; the opening and closing of coal-fired power plants, changing gas and coal prices, and prolonged outages have a major impact on CO2 emissions. Economic developments are also important: they influence the activities of industry, mobility and SMEs (part of the built environment). This thus has an effect for CO2 emissions. Finally, Covid and higher energy prices due to the war in Ukraine also affected emissions.

Table 1 CO2 emissions by sector in 2023 compared to 2022.

|  Sector [kton cos] | 2022 | 2023  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Industry | 13.159 | 13.075  |
|  Energy sector | 9.577 | 7.381  |
|  Mobility | 1.905 | 1.875  |
|  Built environment | 755 | 680  |
|  Agriculture | 41 | 44  |
|  Total | 25.436 | 23.055  |

Rotterdam's CO2 emissions will be 2.4 Mton lower in 2023 than in 2022 (Table 1). The decrease is mainly visible in the energy sector (-2.2 Mton); in industry and built environment there is a small decrease (-0.1 Mton) while in mobility and agriculture emissions remained more or less the same.
![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)
Figure 5. CO2 emissions of different sectors in Rotterdam: Port &amp; Industry, Energy sector, Built environment, Mobility and Agriculture

Figure 5 shows that industry and the energy sector, located in the Port of Rotterdam area, together account for  $89\%$  of Rotterdam's CO2 emissions.

# Forecast for 2024

CO2 emissions in 2024 are difficult to predict. The war in Ukraine is ongoing however, the effect on energy prices, especially gas prices is now (mid-2024) less than in 2022. Nevertheless, gas prices are still higher than before the war and production at chemicals and "other industries" does not yet seem to be recovering. Emissions from refineries are likely to remain at the same level. The AVR, the local waste facility, largely idled by the fire in the fall of 2023, is not expected to return to full operation until the end of 2024. Sustainability in industry has been curtailed and is also expected to have little effect on emissions in 2024. For the energy sector, emissions are expected to be similar to 2023 or slightly lower. The volume of road traffic is increasing, but the electric share is also growing. All in all, emissions in 2024 are likely to be somewhat lower than in 2023.

# Built Environment

Residential energy consumption figures are available through the RKM. About 2023, these consumption figures at the local level are not available now (July 2024). At the national level they are. Based on the national change in emissions from the built environment in 2023 (scope 1) and the changed emission factor for the electricity grid2 (scope 2), a preliminary estimate has therefore been made for all components of the built environment.

Figures on heat use (via local heat grid) are available for residential, but not for commercial and public services
Table 2 Built environment emissions 2023 by subsector, scope 1 (direct emissions) and scope 2 (indirect emissions).

|  Subsector | Scope 1 [kton CO2] | Scope 2 [kton CO2] | Comments  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Housing | 335 | 167 | Scope 2 consists of 18 kton due to heat and 149 kton by electricity use.  |
|  Commercial services | 165 | 442 |   |
|  Public service | 69 | 102 |   |
|  Construction | 2 | 7 |   |
|  Wastewater treatment plants | 109 | 11 |   |
|  Total | 680 | 729 |   |

## Difference from 2022

The figures for 2023 are therefore estimated. For scope 1 CO2 emissions from the built environment, the decrease is 10% cf. the national trend. This has been maintained for all subsectors. The national decrease is due to lower natural gas consumption. The winters of 2023 and 2022 were comparable in terms of temperature, but the price of natural gas for domestic use was still relatively high, especially in the first half of 2023.

For scope 2 emissions, the estimated decrease is 19% based on the changed emission factor of electricity. Meanwhile, the number of homes connected to heat has been steadily increasing for years, causing a slight shift in emissions from scope 1 to scope 2.

![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)
Figure 6 Trend in CO2 emissions scope 1 for the subsectors in the built environment: Wastewater (AWZI), Construction (bouwnijverheid), Public services, commercial services, residential).

## Scope 1

The fluctuations in residential emissions (Figure 6 &amp; figure 7) are mainly due to heating behavior during harsh or appropriately mild winters. The overall trend is that direct CO2 emissions in the built environment are slowly decreasing as buildings are becoming better insulated and winters become, on average, somewhat milder. In the last two years, this decrease has been reinforced by the higher gas price resulting in less gas being used.
![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)
Figure 7 CO2 emissions trend for subsectors in the built environment (scope 2).

# Scope 2

For indirect CO2 emissions (Figure X), electricity use in commercial services (SMEs) makes the largest contribution. The trend is largely part determined by the emission factor for electricity. That emission factor has more than halved since 2015. This is due to a growing share of renewable sources (mainly solar and wind) and a changing mix of fossil sources (coal and gas). This is partly driven by Rotterdam electricity producers. The coal sector is strongly represented in Rotterdam and co-firing of biomass in coal-fired power plants may be considered renewable. The volume of energy from solar and wind also continues to grow in Rotterdam.

# Forecast for 2024

For 2024, scope 1 emissions are expected to be comparable to 2023 or slightly lower. The winter (first half of 2024) was relatively mild. The gas price has dropped somewhat compared to the beginning of 2023, which may raise the thermostat knob a bit again. Due to the renovation and insulation of homes, more connections to the heat grid and an increase in the use of heat pumps, scope 1 emissions will decrease. Scope 2 emissions are likely to continue to decline due to a further decreasing emission factor from the electricity grid. This will be partly offset by an increase in electricity use due to the use of heat pumps and an increase in heat use due to a steady increase in the number of connections to the heat grid.

# Mobility

Road traffic figures come from the various road authorities (state, province and municipality) within the municipal boundaries. These numbers are updated annually with a distinction by type of vehicle (freight and passenger traffic) and speed. DCMR collects these figures. The conversion to CO2 emissions is done by using nationally determined emission factors for road traffic. These were available from CBS for the years up to and including 2018. TNO has determined new emission factors for 2023.

# Scope 1

The figures for rail traffic and mobile machinery are from the RKM; the most recent are for 2022. The figures for shipping and aviation are from the ER. The most recent figures for these sources are also for 2022. For shipping and aviation, these have been translated to 2023 by extrapolation based on respectively:

the number of seagoing and inland vessels in 2023 (Source: HbR 'Nautical Annual Figures Rotterdam Port 2023')
the growth of the number of so-called overland movements at Rotterdam- The Hague Airport in 2023 (source: CBS).

For rail traffic and mobile equipment, emissions in 2023 are the same as in 2022. NOTE. For rail traffic, only emissions from diesel locomotives at the port are concerned.

Electric rail traffic (train, subway and streetcar) is part of scope 2.

Table 3 Mobility emissions in 2023 by mode, scope 1.

|  Subsector | Total [kton CO2] | City* [kton CO2] | Comments  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Road traffic, people | 541 | 541 | Incl. busses  |
|  Road traffic, freight | 378 | 181 | ‘Total’ includes vans and middle heavy and heavy trucks  |
|  Marine | 677 |  |   |
|  Inland Navigation | 91 | 91 |   |
|  Rail traffic | 6 |  | Diesel locomotives harbour railroad  |
|  Aviation | 16 |  |   |
|  Mobile equipment | 166 | 55 | For “total,” includes container sector in the HIC  |
|  Total | 1.875 | 869 |   |

For the mobility target, only the urban portion of mobility is involved. Heavy road traffic (heavy trucks), maritime shipping, rail traffic (port rail line), and the port related portion (estimated two-thirds) of mobile work vehicles then do not count. Aviation is also excluded. Emissions from the urban share in 2023 are 869 kton.

# Difference from 2022

The calculated emissions in 2023 are slightly lower than the (estimated) emissions in 2022. There is a  $4\%$  increase in road traffic mileage in 2023. At the same time, the vehicle fleet has been gradually getting cleaner for years, partly due to a growing share of electric vehicles. For the subsectors other than road traffic, these are estimates based on 2022 figures.

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)
Figure 8 Trend for the different modes of mobility.
Emissions from the mobility sector are fairly stable. The changes depend mainly on the economic climate and also on policy and technical developments.

## Scope 2

For 2023, an estimate was made based on a (one-time) calculation for indirect CO2 emissions from electricity use from mobility in 2005. At the time, this included only rail traffic (subway, streetcar and train). It now also includes road traffic and mobile machinery, although the share is limited. Based on the national trend for electricity use by mobility and the modified emission factor of electricity, the indirect emissions from mobility in 2023 in Rotterdam are estimated at 97 kton.

## Forecast for 2024

Based on national trends for the first quarter, mobility due to less road traffic is expected to see a slight decrease in emissions by 2024. This will be reinforced by a steady increase in electric vehicles. This may lead to a slight increase in scope 2, although this is likely to be offset by a decreasing emission factor for electricity.

## Industry

With the exception of the figures for the subsector "Other Industry," the figures are taken from the electronic environmental annual reports (e-ARs) that companies are required to submit to the competent authority. Statements in the e-Annual Environmental Reports are assessed by the competent authority, adjusted by the companies if necessary, and finally determined. Some corrections are made to these figures in order to comply with the international GHG protocol. This involves the use of biogenic substances, which may be regarded as 0 emissions. It concerns in particular the correction for the incineration of biogenic waste at the AVR waste incineration plant.

Table 4 Industry emissions by subsector in 2023.

|  Subsector | Emissions [kton_{CO2}] | Comments  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Refineries | 9.372 |   |
|  Chemistry | 2.840 | After correction (-4 kton)  |
|  Waste incineration | 602 | After correction (-612 kton) for incineration of biogenic (50.4%) waste  |
|  Other industry* | 261 | Refers to estimate based on growth/contraction of chemistry, as most comparable industry, in 2022-2023.  |
|  Total | 13.075 |   |

*Such as storage and handling, food industry

## Difference from 2022

Emissions from the industry sector decreased by 0.1 Mton in 2023 compared to 2022. For refineries, there is an increase of 0.2 Mton. At the company level, there are differences that may amount to several hundred kilotons. These are due to annual fluctuations in throughput, the use of other fuels or (major) maintenance. In chemistry, emissions remained the same, as well as the estimated emissions from "Other industry. In waste incineration, the decrease is 0.3 Mton due to a fire in September 2023 at AVR that shut down much of the plant.
![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)
Figure 9 Industry emissions by sector: other industry, Refineries, Chemical, Waste Incineration.

Over the past ten years, emissions from industry have not changed significantly.

Fluctuations at refineries arise from annual changes in throughput or maintenance. Economic fluctuations, especially in chemistry and "other industry," affect production and thus emissions. The corona- pandemic outbreak caused a small dip in 2020. The high price of natural gas in 2022 led to lower production especially in the chemical industry and provided an impetus for energy savings throughout the industry.

# Forecast for 2024

Industry emissions in 2024 are expected to remain at similar levels to 2023. An exception is emissions from waste incineration; AVR is not expected to be fully operational again until the end of 2024. This means lower emissions for Rotterdam. The energy transition has not yet had a significant effect on emissions, and the energy saving obligation introduced at the end of 2023 for industry and also the nationwide customized approach for the largest emitters will hardly lead to relevant CO2 reductions in 2024.

# Energy sector

For the energy sector, the figures come from the e-mjv's. For the co-firing of biomass at the Maasvlakte coal-fired power plants (it concerns in particular the Uniper plant), a correction has been applied in accordance with the GHG protocol.

Table 5 Energy sector emissions by subsector.

|  Subsector | Emissions [kton/ cos] | Comments  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Coal plants | 3.779 | After correction (-418 kton) for biomass co-firing  |
|  Gas Power Station | 139 |   |
|  CHP10 | 3.463 |   |
|  Total | 7.381 |   |

# Difference from 2022

Total emissions from the energy sector decreased by 2.2 Mton in 2023 compared to 2022. Because more electricity was generated by wind and solar power, less electricity from fossil sources was needed. The decrease is mainly visible at coal-fired power plants; at gas-fired power plants, emissions remained more or less at the same level.
![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)
Figure 10 Trend CO2-for the different components within the energy sector (hydroelectric power (WKK), gas &amp; coal.

Figure 10 shows the trend of the power sector over the period 2014-2023. The changes in emissions are mainly visible at coal-fired power plants. Two new coal-fired power plants started up in 2013 and 2014, and an old plant was closed in mid-2017. In addition, a gas power plant (Galilei Street) was closed in 2014. Fluctuations in the price of gas and coal and long-term outages, such as at the Power Plant Rotterdam in 2020 and part of 2021, cause fluctuations in CO2 emissions from the power sector.

# Forecast for 2024

Emissions from the energy sector in 2024 are difficult to predict. Energy prices remain at high levels and production by wind and solar is still increasing. All in all, emissions from this sector will, most likely, continue to decline in 2024.

# Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

Rotterdam has a long history of taking action to lower our CO2-emmissions. It was in 2007 we first launched the Rotterdam Climate Initiative (2007), with different stakeholders, with the ambition of 50% less CO2 emissions in 2025 compared to 1990 (unfortunately the target was not met, mainly because the national government decided to open two new coal power plants in 2015 and 2016). To reach this ambition a programme was established called 'Investing in sustainable growth', with concrete pathways and list of actions. But lacking at the time was a clear multi-level governmental framework to foster cooperation on these goals between the different layers of government (national, regional, municipal) and with all the relevant stakeholders and our citizens.

This changed after the Paris agreement which has been a watershed moment for many. As a result, the national Climate Agreement (2019) was established, with clear goals and measures for the different sectors (industry, mobility, built environment, energy and agriculture) to reach - 49% CO2-reduction in 2030. The municipalities agreed upon performing several tasks and implementing specific measures set out in the agreement, which still make up for most of our current work.

# Relation between EU, National, Regional and local policies

Climate action by all stakeholders in the city is affected and influenced by policies on the international, European, national and local level. Not just existing policies: knowledge of upcoming rules and regulations can also heavily influence decisions on timing of actions or investments choices and are important to map.

As stated, the momentum and chance of success of local climate action increased significantly since the Paris Agreement (2015) when as a result a clear multigovernmental framework on the EU-level was established with clear targets, measures, monitoring and division of responsibilities between EU and member states. The Dutch government did the same on the national level, starting with the Climate Agreement of 2019.

The National Energy and Climate Plan (INEK) of the Netherlands, which was presented to the European Commission at the end of 2019, sets out the broad lines of climate and energy policy in the Netherlands for the years 2021-2030, including the policy resulting from European commitments. In 2019, INEK was largely based on the Climate Agreement with the involvement of more than one hundred societal (public and private) parties. This was also the basis for the first Climate Plan, adopted in accordance with the Dutch Climate Law.
![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)
Figure 11 Objectives of the Climate Agreement (2019) for all emission domains

In sum the municipalities agreed in the Climate Agreement (2019) upon performing the following main actions:

Energy: Create a Regional Energy Strategy with neighbouring municipalities (for Rotterdam this coincided with the Metropolitan Area Rotterdam-The Hague, MRDH) with concrete plans for more clean energy production so to contribute to the national goal of 35 terawatt-hour (TWh);
Mobility: create regional mobility plans, participate in the 'national agenda for charging infrastructure' (NAL), and the largest cities agreed into creating a Zero-emission zone for commercial transport;
Built environment: establish a Vision on the Heath Transition (Transitievisie Warmte/TvW, link leads to English abstract), and decide on which neighbourhoods are selected to become natural-gas-free and/or insulated before 2030 and a pathway beyond towards 2050.

These were the most important ones besides more tradition well established task such as providing information and advice and enforcing certain national laws and regulations which also were included in the Climate Agreement (For us as a municipality it's very relevant whether we have an official task, because it's makes us eligible for national funding and sufficient regulatory power.)

A lot has happened since. A European Climate Law entered into force in 2021, tightening Europe's 2030 climate target from  $40\%$  to at least  $55\%$  compared to 1990. Later that year, the European Commission presented the so-called "Fit-for-55 package", a major legislative package with strengthened 2030 climate and energy policies to implement the new climate target.

As a result, in 2022, the Dutch climate targets were tightened. In order to reach climate neutrality by 2050, the Netherlands raised the 2030 target to at least  $55\%$  of CO2-reduction. In order to achieve this goal, the policies were targeted at  $60\%$  in 2030.

The policy in the Climate Plan was updated in June 2022 with the Climate Policy Programme in response to this increased target. Which in addition to the above-mentioned tasks, also added
an extra responsibility for municipalities, namely, to ensure residential buildings are sufficiently insulated.

In table XX we make visible the impact of EU-regulations, national policies on our local climate action

|  European Regulation | Implementation in the Netherlands | National Target | Municipal Role | Governance  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) | Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), Climate Act, Policy Programme Climate | CO2 emissions reduction of at least 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels). |  | Administrative Consultation on Climate and Energy (BO K&E).  |
|  Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) | Environmental Management Act, Building Decree (Bbl) | All buildings must be nearly zero-energy (NZEB) by 2030. | Municipalities realize and enforce natural-gas free neighbourhoods, and stimulate insulation and sustainability requirements for buildings, enforce energielabel C for offices | NPLW (Nationaal Programma Lokale Warmtetransitie)  |
|  Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) | SDE++ subsidies, blending obligation, promotion of renewable energy | 42.5% of total energy consumption from renewables by 2030. | Municipalities cooperate regionally and facilitate renewable energy projects and permit issuance. | NPRES (Nationaal Programma Regionale Energiestrategieën)  |
|  Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) | National Policy Framework for Charging Infrastructure | Deployment of EV charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure. | Municipalities oversee the development and spatial planning of charging infrastructure. | NAL (National Agenda Charginginfrastructure)  |

The conclusion is that for a big part local climate action is part of a multi-level framework and plays an important part in implementing and executing European Policies as implemented by the National Government. For our climate action that means a) a large dependency for the most effective parts (in terms of CO2-reduction) is dependent on other multilevel stakeholders. But as we will show, next to ensure effective implementation, we have a track record of anticipating measures and get a head start and find ways to have an additional impact within our own sphere of influence and capacities.
# A-2.1. European policies

The effect of European Policies affects climate action in Rotterdam in various ways. Directly when establishing directives which target our citizens, businesses and other and local stakeholders. Of those the European Trading System and its effect on the port of Rotterdam and the ones targeting mobility are the most visible. The effect of the European Taxonomy on finance is also beginning to be noticeable. Indirectly by regulations which are implemented by our national government. Of those the European Climate Law and its effect on setting the national goals has shown to be the most importance. In addition, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPDB IV) and the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) have been of importance for municipalities to act on.

# A-2.5. Forecast 2030

On basis of the measures (projects, actions) agreed upon in the Rotterdam Climate Agreement (RKA) in 2019 and the existing policies, we had our fist forecast of the effect of those measures in 2019. The forecast is done on a yearly basis, informing us of the effect of new measures and actions on reaching our goals. The regional Environmental Protection Agency, DCMR, is responsible for the calculations and validation of the different measures, giving us an insightful and independent view on our progress.

# Relation between the KAR and Forecast

The basis of the calculations are all the measures which are included in the KAR project list of the different emission domains, which have all been included in the portfolio of actions.

These measures were also distinguished according to their status: certain, expected and intended.

A large number of measures have been identified within the themes. Some of them have already started, others are foreseen in five to ten years. The expected effect therefore depends on the scope and expected impact of a measure, but also on the degree of (in)certainty that it will be implemented. Measures are therefore divided into four categories that indicate the stage a measure is in and thus how 'hard' the estimated CO2 effect is.

Sure. The measure has already started or is definitely going to start. The measure has been decided on, funding has been arranged and/or the measure is required by law.
Expected. There is agreement on the measure, but the final decision on its implementation has not yet been taken.
Intended. Plans for the measure are in place, its implementation is known in outline, an estimate of the expected impact has been made, but parties do not yet fully agree on its exact details. Financing is also yet to be arranged.
Insufficiently concrete: For these measures, much is still unclear. Sometimes an estimated CO2 effect has been named but it is not clear what it is based on. For such measures, the effect is set to 'zero' (for now).

Figure 12 Effect climate actions Rotterdam on CO2 emission.

DCMR has assessed the measures of the KAR in terms of their effect on CO2 emissions in particular in the target years 2025 and 2030. That effect was determined compared to the situation in 2022, the starting point of the current administration. Figure 12 shows the expected effect of the current (January 2024) KAR measure package and of national autonomous developments in the gas mix and electricity mix on Rotterdam's CO2 emissions and indicates the extent to which the targets will be achieved. Where applicable EU-legislation has been taken into account, mainly in the mobility domain.

# Mayors target 2025 urban area

The implementation of the current KAR in combination with making the rural electricity grid and the rural gas mix more sustainable will result in a total reduction of 493 kton for the urban area in 2025 compared to current CO2 emissions (which are 2,816 kton in 2022). If all expected and envisaged plans are actually implemented - which depends, among other things, on further implementation, decision-making and financing - this will reduce emissions in the urban area to 2,323 kton. This will meet the mayors target for 2025 (target value is a maximum of 2,578 kton of CO2).

# Target 2030 city and port

The KAR leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions by 11,662 kton in 2030 for the total territory of Rotterdam (i.e. incl. port and industry) compared to current emissions (24,905 kton in 2022). The magnitude of the effect is similar to the previous calculation, but because current emissions are lower, the remaining emissions in 2030 are also lower (i.e. 13,243 kton). The target value for 2030 is 10,440 kton. The 2030 target is thus not yet achieved with the current KAR package of measures. The residual target for 2030 is 2,803 kton of CO2. This is less than the 4,449 kton from the previous calculation, but the task remains the same: additional measures are needed to reach the 2030 target. Especially in Port &amp; Industry, there is still some potential.

# Description of measures by sector

The measures in the Built Environment mainly concern a continuation of the approach aimed at reducing scope 1 emissions (gas heating). The measure with the greatest CO2 impact
1

remains disconnecting homes from gas and connecting them to the heat network. This delivers a 70% reduction per dwelling but does mean an increase in scope 2 emissions due to greater heat use. The contributions of the measures are more or less equally divided between 'certain', 'expected' and 'intended'.

For the Mobility sector, it concerns a mix of EU, national and local measures. Local measures such as the introduction of the ZE zone, the modal split approach and the employer approach to sustainable mobility contribute substantially to a reduction of scope 1 emissions in this sector. However, some of the measures also cause an increase in electricity consumption and thus additional scope 2 emissions. Most of the measures are now certain or expected.

At Port &amp; Industry, the effect of the measures has increased compared to the previous calculation due to a large increase in the capacity of the planned electrolysers. In addition, it is important - especially since Port &amp; Industry involves projects with a large CO2 effect - that the status of some large measures has been 'moved up': there is now more certainty about their implementation.

The Clean Energy sector's commitment changes the avoided emissions from planned wind farms and large solar PV projects. Because some projects have now been realised, the expected impact in 2030 of those yet to be implemented is lower than last year. Rotterdam's commitment to wind and solar ensure that less fossil electricity generation is needed, thus contributing to the greening of the national electricity mix. Almost all measures have the status certain or expected.

# Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

In this module we provide the analysis and assessment of the different sectors and systems prone to change because of the energy transition and the barriers and opportunities we have identified. These are important to address so to enhance the chance of success of reaching climate neutrality in time. Barriers and opportunities, as we will show, can be two sides of the same coin, depending whether they are addressed effectively and on time. This section will also provide insight into the various public interest we have identified and established to guide us on the path towards a climate neutral city.

We start with all the sectoral changes and the changes for the city in a whole to become climate neutral. Because of how they relate to one another and are approached in an integral way, having many of the same stakeholders, to prevent duplication, it should be read as a whole, in this particular order. We will highlight those elements that have a relation with the energy transition, which is already a lot, to prevent presenting a complete overview of all our city-wide policies, actions and stakeholders. With this section we also touch on the main relevant (policy) visions mentioned in the previous section, which for part were written to address.

[N.B. In deviation from the template, where it speaks of technology and infrastructure, we choose a broader term to reflect that the city can be perceived as an ecosystem on itself and a lever for chance. Also allowing a more integral, holistic way in approaching barriers and opportunities and related stakeholders]

## A-3.1. City development

A city on itself can be perceived as one ecosystem connected with many other systems: social, economic, technological and environmental. Renewal of the energy system is the most dominant technological factor in achieving on time a climate neutral city and has a systemic impact on relevance for other developments. Because of that dominance, and its relationship towards other domains/systems, we use this as a 'lens' to address other related systemic barriers. We elaborate therefore extensively on the energy system first, the effect for the city development as a whole next, so we can address the others more in brief.

## A-3.1.1. The Energy system

The energy system is changing dramatically, becoming more diverse, complex, smart and decentralized. At the same time, we want to ensure that our energy supply is clean, smart, resilient and equitable. We therefore put these public interests at the center.

The Rotterdam energy system must ensure that energy for living, moving and working remains available at the right time, in the right form and for everyone. This is because the system is essential for the 'good growth' that Rotterdam chooses in its Spatial and Environmental vision (see next section). This requires radical adjustments in all parts of the system. At the same time, the transition to a sustainable energy system requires space, making it also a design task.
# Development of energy mix in Rotterdam (PJ)

Figure 13 Development of energy mix in Rotterdam.

The energy mix will change dramatically with more electricity, more collective heating and cooling, a greater role for hydrogen in the port-industrial complex, and less solid and liquid fuels as fossil energy sources are phased out. This affects the capacity and type of infrastructure needed: a heavier electricity network, gas pipelines being removed and the construction of additional heat and cold networks. Infrastructure is also structuring the energy transition: acceleration of electrification and the transition to hydrogen is possible in places where energy networks are present and adequate for this purpose.
The energy system is becoming a network with local storage, decentralized production and the connection of different sources. Grid stabilization, storage and facilitating two-way traffic are indispensable for this. A flexible energy system can respond to
fluctuations in supply and demand. This requires demand management, energy storage, energy conversion and robust interconnection between different energy infrastructures. During the transition of the Rotterdam energy system, current, temporary and future-fixed energy infrastructures will be used simultaneously alongside each other and require space in both the upper and lower floors. Due to the many dependencies, a clear direction role of the municipality is desirable.

The future energy system creates visible changes in the city and landscape and requires more space than a fossil system at different scales. There is a constant interaction between issues and solutions at the city and regional level, neighborhoods, districts and in the street. Renewable generation, electricity grid reinforcement and the rollout of heat networks require space and can create more infrastructure in the subsurface and structures above ground. There are energy functions that go well with other functions, but there are also functions that do not go well with other functions. In the first case, you can look for synergy by coordinating in advance with other tasks such as housing, greening and climate adaptation. In another situation, the one excludes the other; this requires a clear consideration process. It is important that developments in the energy system do justice to and are in balance with the use, perception, quality and future of Rotterdam's space.

To flesh out resilience in the Rotterdam energy system, we are working within a Rotterdam Resilience strategy. This is a framework to help assess how resilient an organization and a (future) energy system is. This in relation to challenges ranging from climate change to digital disruption. The framework has three dimensions that can be divided into different goals and indicators:

Leadership and strategy: Achieving resilience in the energy system requires effective leadership with a clear, strategic vision supported by effective regulation. This also requires inclusive governance involving government, regulators, planners and grid operators.
Economy and society: Achieving resilience in the energy system requires commitment not only from the energy sector, but also from society. The socioeconomic dimension includes the understanding of social needs and the collective approach to cope with critical situations.
Infrastructure and ecosystems: Infrastructure includes more than just physical plants, but also production, control systems, operational departments, the interaction between them and the environment. A resilient infrastructure has effectively controlled plants and adequate capacity. A forward-looking approach that takes climate change into account is also important. Solutions should focus on sustainability and offer the transition to alternative energy sources and technologies.

It is fundamental to create a system that can meet the daily needs of homes, businesses, services and governments while smoothly transitioning to a greener, more resilient future. That is why resilience is a foundation of our vision for a future-proof energy system.

# Main barriers and opportunities

A clean energy system is:

sustainable and circular, efficient, climate neutral, prevents environmental pollution and improves livability.
With a clean energy system, we take responsibility for the living environment of Rotterdam citizens. By preventing environmental pollution and improving livability, Rotterdam becomes a more attractive and healthier city. A clean energy system also prevents problems being passed on outside the city or to other generations. At the same time, the development of a clean energy system is a transition, so alternatives are not always fully sustainable right away. For example, although the production of electricity and heat is becoming increasingly sustainable, fossil fuels are currently still needed. We ensure that our current choices do not impede a transition to a completely clean energy system in the future.
A clean energy system is also a circular energy system. The energy transition requires new elements of the energy system for generation, transportation and distribution, conversion, storage and use of energy. For example, to make electricity production more sustainable, more solar panels and wind turbines are being installed, while we are discontinuing coal and gas power plants. In addition, the production of solar energy requires an expansion of the electricity network. How is this done in the most circular way possible? What materials will be released as a result of the energy transition and what will we do with them? And what materials will be used in the new situation?
When designing the new components, it is important to look at the impact of materials. But also, at the opportunities that exist for flexible and adaptive design and good management, so that the technical lifespan can be optimally utilized, and high-quality reuse is possible. In the coming period, we want to increase our knowledge around promising circular measures in renewable energy technologies.

A smart energy system

takes full advantage of the opportunities offered by digitalization, ensuring efficient interconnection of supply and demand and exchange between energy systems.
In a smart energy system, we make optimal use of the opportunities offered by new technologies. We want to ensure that energy is used and deployed optimally by cleverly controlling energy supply and exchanging energy. This requires good monitoring, which makes the commitment to far-reaching digitalization important.
Working digitally is also necessary to be able to work adaptively and make choices at the right time: based on data we can design smartly, combine smartly, roll out smartly and anticipate smartly.

A resilient system ensures security of energy supply.

A resilient energy system is reliable and shock-resistant, so that we can count on energy being available at times when it is needed. Even when the system is disrupted or modified or under pressure or stress, such as from cyber-attacks. The system must be robust enough to withstand a crisis situation and adaptive enough to embrace and overcome uncertainties in the energy transition.
At the same time, energy supply is constantly evolving. Traditional energy supply and substantial redundancy are being replaced by finely tuned, dynamic, increasingly complex, interdependent and interactive systems. These modifications increase the likelihood of failures spreading rapidly through the system. Therefore, energy system resilience must be considered at every step. Resilience takes into account social, technical and organizational factors. Consider physical aspects, but also leadership, policy, stakeholder and social factors.
Smart rollout - We take uncertainties into account by rolling out the policy or strategy step by step

Smart anticipation - We consider whether, for the most extreme scenario and all possible risks, there are sufficient measures, mitigation options, time and money available to still meet policy goals.

Smart combining - We combine tasks as much as possible: through planning to explore and limit costs and inconvenience or by tackling multiple problems at once. This is in line with the integral working method.

Smart design - We design an optimal strategy taking into account smart combinations, potential risks and the costs and effects of available measures, time, money and phasing options.

A just energy system is inclusive and accessible to all.

It is affordable and ensures a fair distribution of the joys and burdens of the energy transition.
Inclusiveness is important because it is necessary to prevent some residents from being excluded or disadvantaged by policy. There are many differences among the Rotterdam population in terms of housing situation, lifestyle, culture, nationality, gender, income, level of education and religion. These residents make different choices and express themselves in different behavior. It is important to consider this when making policy. This requires an active process of awareness and deepening, and broadening the network of partners involved.
Rotterdam has a relatively large group for whom it is more difficult to keep up. In addition, energy prices are expected to continue to rise. Partly for this reason, it is extra important that the energy transition is and remains affordable. That we keep an eye on the affordability of the system and what this means for the energy bill of the Rotterdammer. As a municipality we deploy our resources and instruments in such a way that everyone can participate. What the consequences and necessary interventions are, we investigate, so that we can reduce the causes of energy poverty and improve the affordability of the system and the energy bill. And so that all Rotterdammers now and in the future can (continue to) pay the energy bill and make the necessary investments in and around the home.

To conclude, there are many opportunities and barriers over time which can be managed. But it takes time to ensure all the system, distribution and inclusion issues are addressed properly.

## Short term issues

### Solar PV's

If we push hard, we will almost reach our contribution to the Rotterdam Den Haag Regional Energy Strategy (3.4 km2 panels in 2030) by 2026. It is wise to get a head start, because the national targets for solar energy are likely to be raised after 2030. Points of interest:

Circularity of solar panels: solar panels are not easy to recycle now.
There must be enough space on the congested power grid to dispose of solar power.
We want a good balance between different purposes on roofs: solar, greening, water storage and housing.

### Wind
Environmentally conscious development of wind energy requires extra municipal effort for the wind farms in procedure and those yet to be developed. In doing so, we are committed to a combination of public participation and communication. The Strekdam in Hoek van Holland is an example of a research location from the Regional Energy Strategy.
The new national standards for siting wind on land were published in draft form at the end of 2023. Uncertainty remains of their effect on the wind farms under development.
The realization of a stable electricity grid requires agreements with grid operators, Port Authority and other stakeholders, since most windmills are in the Port of Rotterdam Area.
Research into repowering existing wind turbines in the port is necessary in order to maintain the target of 350 MW of installed capacity even after 2030.

## Energy system - electricity

Rotterdam faced tightness on the electricity grid in 2022. Demand for electricity rose much faster than expected, especially in the port. High-voltage grid operator TenneT announced in October 2023 that it will definitely not be able to meet the increasing demand until the grid is upgraded. It is TenneT's responsibility to respond properly to electricity demand.
TenneT is working hard to expand capacity, but that will not provide a structural solution until 2030.
There are quite a few challenges ahead. Above and below ground there must be sufficient space for transformer stations, pipes and cables. Many and well-trained personnel are needed. Sometimes laws and regulations are a bump in the road. Municipality and grid operators must strengthen and improve their cooperation so that together they can meet the challenges.

## A-3.1.2. Urban development

The transition towards a climate neutral city has a direct and indirect impact on almost parts of our city's daily life and functioning. In 2021 we assessed, with the involvement of many stakeholders, how we can turn into a climate neutral city along all other needed developments for our city (Spatial Planning and Environmental Strategy, 'a city in change'). Looking for ways we can use the energy transition as a lever of change for other developments and how to prevent undesired developments.

Our city has a number of challenges which effect one another:

The life expectancy of the inhabitants is lower than in other parts of the country and the population is relatively poorly educated. The Rotterdam economy is doing well but many economic sectors need to change in order to become cleaner and become more sustainable and thus to remain (internationally) competitive. Rotterdam is internationally known for its smart handling of the water and benefits from its beautiful location in delta, but at the same time climate change and rising sea level rise are particularly noticeable here.

The migration to the city continues and Rotterdam is also popular. More and more people want to live, work and recreate there. Realizing sufficient housing, employment and facilities is essential to accommodate this migration to the city. At these developments, the attractiveness of the city and region is more important than ever. A biodiverse, healthy and easily accessible landscape in and around the city is a precondition for a pleasant life in living in Rotterdam and the region.

8
On top of that we are dealing with big changes because of all the major transitions. The energy transition has a major impact on the city and the region, because our industry and logistics still largely use fossil fuels. It is clear that the energy mix in our region will change in the coming years. Also, as a city adapt to climate change and strive for a circular economy. The mobility pattern in cities is changing, there are more and more new forms of transportation. Moreover, is the digitalization of our society progressing.

Multiple tasks causing the city and use of space to dramatically change. These tasks require a clear vision and a clear course.

## Main choices and path forward

Rotterdam opts for good growth. Growth that contributes to the inhabitants, to a sustainable society and to economic progress. Growth that supports and strengthens Rotterdam's rich heritage and identity, whereby we involve Rotterdammers in the process of change. This is essential to ensure that we are and remain an attractive city for all Rotterdammers, because together with we make the city.

This results in five main choices for the long-term development of our city:

Rotterdam is committed to pleasant living in the delta. We make Rotterdam a healthy, green and attractive city to live, work and recreate. Our rivers - the Maas, the Schie and the Rotte are our most important green-blue connections. We are creating new parks and greening our boulevards, such as Blaak and Westblaak. We connect green structures for attractive routes and to increase biodiversity. At the same time, by adding greenery we are working to reducing heat stress and collecting water during heavy during heavy rainfall. We make it attractive and easy to exercise outdoors. The car takes a step back and we offer more space to cyclists and pedestrians.

Rotterdam is going to urbanize &amp; connect. We are urbanizing within the existing city to strengthen the city. We do this mainly at and around existing or new high-quality public transport. This is the most sustainable way of urbanization. That is why we invest with our partners in, among other things, a new riverbank connection, new stations and more trains on the railroad between Leiden and Dordrecht (Old Line). By adding housing creates a larger support base for amenities. With higher densities, more people live in the close proximity to various amenities. People can reach all their daily amenities on foot or by bike: the city around the corner. By developing a network of complementary urban centers, we make sure that our top locations strengthen each other.

Rotterdam is committed to vital neighbourhoods. It should not matter where you grow up to have the same chance of getting a good education a good home and suitable work. In our neighbourhoods a lot many challenges come together: energy transition, climate adaptive and socio-economic challenges. We are tackling these in together to make the neighbourhoods future-proof. In all neighbourhoods we focus on a diverse range of living and working space and the public space is in order. Social facilities grow with the city and are used more intensively.

Rotterdam is putting its shoulders to the wheel for the energy and resource transition. In the coming years we will generate energy differently and cleaner, distribute it differently and reduce demand. We will also close material cycles. In the port-industrial complex this means electrification of processes and use of hydrogen as an energy carrier. We use residual heat to provide the urban area with heat and we are making our housing stock. We are also making urban mobility and transport to and in the port.

9
Rotterdam renews its earning capacity. Rotterdam has a strong economic starting position, a world port, an airport, a strong logistics sector and growing manufacturing industry. These sectors will continue to be important for future employment and earning capacity, but they will have to undergo coming years. At the same time, due in part to its excellent (international) accessibility, Rotterdam is a centre of innovation and knowledge-intensive services. We welcome new business models, such as start-ups in the circular economy. Companies that cause nuisance and therefore fall into a high environmental category, we concentrate as much as possible at a few locations. Through good networking and interaction creates innovation in the existing and new economy; precisely that is the economic strength of our city.

While acting upon these five main choices, continued attention to environmental quality and living environment is needed. Our environmental impact assessment makes clear that, among other things, the combination of densification within the existing city and the effort focusing on the transition of the economy leads to challenges regarding environmental and health issues. By including these issues in the development at an early stage, risks can be limited and negative effects avoided.

## Main barriers and opportunities

### The future energy system brings a solid additional space claim

Rotterdam continues to grow in every way, in terms of inhabitants, housing, jobs and ambitions. And that demands a lot of space, space that is scarce and has limits. For example, the ambition is to build 50,000 new homes and approximately 70,000 new jobs by 2040. We are also working toward the realization of 15,000 acres of recreational green space by 2030. In addition, we want to make the city with its outdoor space, real estate and gardens water-robust and climate-proof with more greenery, and space is needed for new sustainable activity in the port. These are just a few examples of tasks at hand. The future energy system will also become more complex and require more space and may lead to more structures in the city. It will also require more cables and pipes in the subsurface, which must be well coordinated with the topsoil (trees, water collection, etc.). All the tasks we have as a city increase the pressure on space. The question of how to make the right trade-offs arises more and more often.

How do we coordinate plans and schedules to address the implementation of the various tasks and transitions in the city simultaneously and integrally? There are questions about how to limit the impact of necessary interventions in both the subsoil and the surface. And how to combine tasks intelligently. And how do we ensure that we do justice to the ambitions without compromising the quality of the living environment?

### Competing interest and thus the need for aligned visions, policies as well as executing them in an integral way.

It is not easy to achieve the goals from various policy areas together in a way they strengthen each other instead of conflicting with one another. To achieve an integrated view, we work with five long-term goals that together give direction to the future of the physical living environment. We call these perspectives: compact, productive, sustainable, inclusive and healthy. They form a 'compass' with which we set course. An instrument to achieve good growth, where in practice we must always search for the right balance. Because we know that we can never pursue all five perspectives to the same extent. But we do look at each development through all five lenses.

**Compact city:** We choose to develop Rotterdam as a compact, attractive city by the river (. A hub in an international network, with strong public transportation and plenty of space for

0
outdoor living. Rotterdam is and will remain an architectural city that dares to experiment and steers for a smart mix of buildings and greenery. A city where proximity is and as many appropriate facilities as possible for everyone within walking and cycling distance. The city around the corner with accessible public transport always nearby. Rotterdam chooses to mix functions where possible and for separating functions where must. Rotterdam deals intensively and inclusively with space and use in time.

**Productive city**: Rotterdam provides space for the new economy. We are building the port city of the future with a competitive and innovative economy that responds to international trends such as digitization, robotization, 3d-printing, artificial intelligence, energy transition and circularity. Among other things, Rotterdam is making space for innovative manufacturing, circular economy and so-called interaction environments. In addition, Rotterdam is on the connection with education, lifelong learning and innovative and small-scale entrepreneurship. Accessibility of learning and working locations are crucial.

**Sustainable city**: Rotterdam is growing into a city and port that is showing leadership in the transition to renewable energy, circular processes and a climate-neutral society. Districts become natural gas-free, mobility in steps emission-free and the urban and port economy are making a transition to sustainable and circular. In addition, Rotterdam offers plenty of room for experiments and own initiatives of residents and entrepreneurs. Rotterdam is thus preparing itself for the future and contributing to limiting climate change and renewing the economy. In order to give these major transitions a place Rotterdam, it is also vital to connect the development above the ground as well as underneath it.

**Inclusive city**: Rotterdam is a city where no one is in the majority is. One city on two shores that is accessible to everyone is, a socially resilient city where people from all layers of the population and of all ages, religions and beliefs participate and meet. Therefore, we are committed to mixed neighbourhoods where people feel connected to, good schools and facilities in every neighbourhood. Safe and accessible routes to work and facilities. An attractive public space that is accessible to everyone, that lends itself for intensive and varied use and for meeting. We approach the urban transitions with an eye for the interests of all stakeholders and we are committed to share the costs fairly and proportionately.

**Healthy City**: Rotterdam makes healthy living possible for all residents in the city. We do this by health promotion - stimulating healthy behaviour - and health protection - protection against negative external effects, such as poor air quality and noise pollution. Homes have a healthy indoor climate and consist of healthy (building) materials. We aim for a better and healthy life expectancy for Rotterdammers in all areas. Our spatial choices contribute to this. We are committed to cleaner air and a better balance between peace (quiet) and bustle (urbanity and bustle). We are also committed to Rotterdam as a climate proof city in the delta and we protect residents against safety risks. In addition, the physical living environment invites Rotterdammers to a more vital life through more play, exercise and sports. In and around the healthy city there is sufficient biodiversity, we provide diversity and species richness in flora and fauna for healthy living for humans and animals.

**The energy transition as well as adaptation leads for big parts of Rotterdam to an accumulation of cost which for most individual homeowners are unbearable.**

For tens of thousands of Rotterdam homeowners, especially in vulnerable neighbourhoods, the accumulation of tasks is unaffordable. These homes involve, for instance, foundation repair, overdue maintenance, sustainability and the switch to natural gas-free. This is according to a study on the vitality of 164,000 private homes in Rotterdam. For purpose of that study, the tasks in the housing stock (from foundation repair to sustainability) have been bundled and the financial consequences have been measured against the average disposable income of owner-occupiers. This brings into focus areas where the accumulation of tasks is

1
enormous, and owner-occupiers often cannot afford necessary investments. This applies to the focus districts in the Charlois and Feijenoord areas and the Lombardijen district in the IJsselmonde area of the National Programme Rotterdam South (NPRZ). There are also a number of vulnerable areas on the north bank.

In total, over three billion euros are needed in Rotterdam to future-proof some 36,000 homes owned by people on a small budget. Without this investment, costs rise and the accumulation of tasks for these Rotterdammers becomes even greater.

## Build Environment

## Residential buildings

The energy transition in the built environment is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires systemic solutions and collaborative efforts. Rotterdam will need financial investments, (new) policy frameworks and action across all levels of government and society to address the following barriers:

Limited feasibility of district heating: financial viability is currently a significant challenge. High infrastructure costs combined with current energy prices and insecurity about future energy prices, often render these projects economically unfeasible. This in return affects the public acceptance of district heating and households will turn to heat pumps instead. This in return creates a problem on the electricity network. On top, the government has decided to make private heath compagnies public again. This results in an investment stop from the two major suppliers of district heating in Rotterdam. We have to find a solution for this impasse to reach our current goals in 2030.
Multiple challenges in homes: households face challenges beyond energy efficiency; maintenance, affordability of basic needs, language barriers and dependence on their landlord when wanting to take measures. Competing priorities complicate efforts to focus on energy transition measures.
Insulation requirements: a large portion of the housing stock in Rotterdam requires substantial insulation upgrades to meet energy efficiency standards. The associated costs are an obstacle for both homeowners and housing associations. Furthermore, it is difficult for tenants to insulate as they are often dependent on the (private) landlord.
Limited resident capacity for action: a fair amount of residents lacks financial resources and mental bandwidth to take action. Organizing home improvements, applying for subsidies, and understanding technical options can be overwhelming, particularly for vulnerable populations.
Energy poverty: Energy poverty is a significant barrier to equitable progress. Households with limited financial means are disproportionately affected by rising energy costs and are often unable to invest in energy-saving measures.
Inactive Houseowners Association (VvE's): many of them not active, have saved insufficiently and are complicated for taking joint investment decisions.

## New Buildings

Rotterdam must build 55,000 new homes by 2030 to solve the housing shortage. It is very important that these new homes be sustainable and energy efficient, which is not only comfortable for the residents but also beneficial for the climate. The material use and construction process of the homes are also important, as they have a significant impact on the environment. With current traditional construction methods, CO2 emissions are about 340 kilograms per square meter. To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, we must drastically

2
reduce these emissions. For "Paris-proof" construction, CO2 emissions would have to be reduced to:

200 kilograms of CO2 per square meter for a single-family home;
220 kilograms of CO2 per square meter for a multi-family dwelling.

The municipality will continue to share knowledge and provide advice. It is expected that legal requirements for new construction plans on sustainability will be further tightened in the coming years. Nationally, the scope for municipalities to set and require sustainability performance is drastically reduced. Since the statutory sustainability requirements are lower than our sustainability ambitions, we must engage with the government to preserve this space or to be able to co-decide on how and where this space could be limited, so that Rotterdam can continue to build future-proof and we maintain perspective to achieve our climate-neutral ambitions for 2030 and 2050. It is becoming increasingly difficult to include sustainable measures in affordable housing given the high cost of construction.

## Small and Medium enterprises (SME's) /Business

Entrepreneurs who consume more than 50,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity or 25,000 cubic meters of gas must report once every 4 years what energy-saving measures they are taking. This is the information obligation energy saving. The City of Rotterdam has assigned control of this information obligation to the Rijnmond Environmental Department (DCMR). By early 2023, an estimated 68% of these companies will have fulfilled the information obligation. Many of these companies are now implementing energy measures. About 20% of the total number of companies have implemented all measures. The DCMR checks the reports submitted and can issue fines.

Enforcement is difficult because the DCMR gets no insight from the grid operator into which companies are large consumers and because of a shortage of well-trained inspectors. The municipality and DCMR urge the grid operator to share data on large-scale users so that DCMR can actively write to them.

## Mobility

The energy transition in the mobility sector is essential for achieving Rotterdam's sustainability goals and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the implementation of sustainable mobility solutions faces numerous structural and systemic barriers that must be addressed to accelerate progress. Below, we outline barriers:

Insufficient Structural Financing for Zero-Emission Zones: while establishing zero-emission zones is a critical component of the city's energy transition strategy, funding for their development and enforcement is not structurally secured. This lack of consistent financial support jeopardizes long-term planning and the successful implementation of these zones.
Uncertainty in Electric Vehicle Availability: the transition to electric mobility is hindered by uncertainties in the availability of electric vehicles (EVs), especially for heavy-duty transport and specialized vehicles.
Insufficient Financing for Charging Infrastructure: the deployment of charging infrastructure, including public and private charging points, lacks adequate structural funding. This financial gap slows the expansion of a reliable charging network, which is essential for supporting the growing number of EVs.
Grid Capacity Constraints: the energy grid's capacity is not always sufficient to meet the increasing demand for electricity from charging infrastructure. Delays in grid

3
upgrades and the complexity of connecting charging stations to the grid pose significant barriers.

Urban Space Constraints: Rotterdam's dense urban environment poses logistical challenges for the installation of charging stations and the accommodation of EVs.

## Labour Market

The changes in Rotterdam's energy system have an impact on jobs in the city and in the port. Therefore, the municipality wants as many Rotterdammers as possible to benefit from employment opportunities. This is done through collaborations with educational institutions and businesses in the region, but also through small-scale projects at the neighborhood level.

The biggest challenge is getting enough people excited to get started in the energy transition. For years there has not been enough intake in technical education to meet the large demand for labor in all sectors. A large-scale labour market survey presented by the EBZ and the province of Zuid-Holland at the end of 2018, showed that bottlenecks in the Zuid-Holland labour market cost the region some €6 billion. One in five companies could not find enough qualified staff at that time.

At the same time, there was a large unused labour potential: 27,000 people could work (more), compared to the Dutch average. The region can count on additional growth of 3.7% if it tackles labour market bottlenecks from a shared vision and with a common agenda. Also, the major transitions, such as making the economy more sustainable and developing and deploying new technology, can only be carried out if the South Holland labor market improves structurally.

The City of Rotterdam, educational institutions in the region and businesses are therefore not only focusing on 'from school to work', but also on 'from work to work' and 'at work'. Projects focus on increasing the influx towards the technical sector and solving the current and future mismatch in the labor market.

Infrastructure: There are opportunities for employment in building, reinforcing and maintaining the necessary infrastructure, such as the heat and power grid.
Home modifications: Insulating and ventilating buildings creates many jobs. TNO expects the insulation task in Rotterdam to lead to about 900 jobs by 2030. New forms of electricity generation and storage and electrification of mobility also create changes in and around the home.
Port: There are also many changes in employment in the port-industrial complex. For example, jobs will disappear due to the closure of coal-fired power plants and the phasing out of fossil activities, while at the same time developments around hydrogen will create new jobs. CE Delft has calculated that hydrogen in the Netherlands could generate a demand for labor of 6-17 thousand FTEs in 2030 and 16-92 thousand FTEs in 2050.18 A large part of this is in the import, trade and transit of hydrogen. The Port of Rotterdam expects to play a major role in this. The offshore wind sector will also grow to about 12 thousand FTE in 2030. From the Just Transition Fund there is a firm commitment to creating a healthy labor market to support the energy transition in the port and at the same time fully commit to retraining and upskilling the current workforce.

# A-3.2. Governance and Policy

Figure 15 multi-level decision-making process concerning the energy system, illustrates the coherence between different sectors, spatial planning and investment.

In terms of governance, for each sectoral agreed policy in the Climate Agreement, there are National Programmes in place to implement and

![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)
monitor the agreed measures in cooperation with regional authorities and municipalities. Because many changes needed for the energy transition and the density of the Netherlands, close alignment with spatial planning processes is needed, as shown in figure 15.
6

# A-3.3. Social innovation, democracy and participation

## Social entrepreneurship

In order to find more people who can join the workforce that is needed for the energy transition, the municipality is working with several social entrepreneurs in Rotterdam. They have programs to train the unemployed to work in the energy transition. They have already started training people to work on solar energy, and on building district heating systems.

## Activating citizens

There are several initiatives in Rotterdam that activate citizens to participate in the energy transition, and also develop their own skills at the same time. In Bospolder Tussendijken, one of the poorest neighbourhoods of the Netherlands, for example, there is a program called "Resilient BoTu". As part of that program there are many projects that are linked to the introduction of district heating in that area. Resilient BoTu follows the method of Asset Based Community Development, and is monitored by the "Veldacademie", a research platform that links the city of Rotterdam with several universities in the region.

## Stimulating energy sharing between large consumers

Since Rotterdam is facing grid congestion, it is not possible for large consumers to get new grid connections and expand their current grid connection. Large consumers can share their contracts and use electricity at different time slots. In this manner there can be possibilities to electrify processes and expand business. Rotterdam stimulates large consumers to research the possibility of energy sharing by subsidizing "Flex Scans", research of the energy profiles, and possibilities to share energy or contracts for large energy consumers that are situated close to each other.

## Citizen counsel

To tackle the barriers that Rotterdam faces in creating support for the energy transition in Rotterdam, the current administration started a citizen council that took place in 2024. A group of 100 citizens advised the administration on additional ways to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in Rotterdam. Part of the citizen counsel will remain active as an advisor to the administration of Rotterdam.

## Energy Communities

In order to make sure citizens of Rotterdam reap the financial benefits of the energy transition, to increase support from citizens for the energy transition, and also to get a group of people who is willing to change their behaviour, Rotterdam is supporting the growth of energy communities. There are currently seven energy communities active. The city of Rotterdam subsidizes "Energie van Rotterdam", which is an NGO that supports the energy communities by assisting them in their professional development, and making sure learnings are exchanged between the energy communities in Rotterdam, as well as connection them to the national and international learnings taking place. The energy communities are currently mostly active in the field of solar energy. The municipality and the energy communities are working together in discovering which role energy communities can take in the heat transition and how energy communities can get a better position in wind energy as well. As part of the "Nationaal Klimaatakkoord" that Rotterdam committed to, the municipality has policy in place to ensure 50% local ownership in large scale solar and wind projects.

Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

As shown in the previous sections, the municipality of Rotterdam on its own has the biggest influence on the built environment, mobility, the local energy system and local businesses. In the Climate Action Plan Rotterdam (KAR, appendix 1) detailed information is shared on targets, sub-targets, actions and projects that were/are/will be undertaken.

The plan is made to monitor and communicate about our progress. The infographics in this plan show what results we have achieved, what results we expect to achieve and what gap still exists towards climate neutrality. So, it offers us the opportunity to properly discuss progress with the municipal council. It also shows that residents' and entrepreneurs' commitment is needed to achieve our climate goals. The plan was first published in April 2023 and is updated and discussed twice a year.

The European consortium Net Zero Cities has developed a logic: the theory of change. By defining these impact pathways, systematically analyzing the outcomes and secondary outcomes, this logic ensures that we can clearly see what needs to be done to facilitate and accelerate this transition. Since the admission of the CCC is for a part meant as an evaluation moment, an analysis has taken place to identify which pathways were not addressed in our current action plan. We performed a 'gap analysis', identifying the consistency between our policies, identified pathways and actions.

We concluded that the current reporting, as we were already sensing, has a couple of shortcomings:

Pathways are not for every demission domain clearly established. As a result, its monitoring contains a mixture of input, output and outcome indicators. For some domains, the reason is due to not having established a clear 'end' goal in our current policies and/or other multilevel stakeholders. We are concretely referring to the level of insulation, which is also linked to the temperature level of district heating (see section A-3), and second the goal for renewable energy, which is part of a regional multi-stakeholder process to determine. So, as we show in B-1, we started working on a new outline for multiple pathways that we see for every domain.
The list of actions or projects which are presented in the annual Budget, KAR, and the calculations on CO2-emmissions do not correspond always, due to separate administrative procedures, we are currently digitalizing in a common data environment, so we don't have to separately report and increase coherency.

B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios, Impact Pathways

We have arranged all existing relevant policies so that we can show the impact pathways in a structured manner. These overviews (maps) provide insight in the coherence of the issues we work on and at the same time expose gaps. This will guide us further into updating our action plan in preparation for the incoming administration.

Our current main goals are a climate neutral Rotterdam in 2050 and a 55% reduction of GHG emissions by people and organisations in 2030 compared to 1990. This translates into four domains of focus (excluding the Rotterdam harbour):

In 2030, Businesses have more sustainable processes and GHG emissions are reduced.
In 2030, Rotterdam will have a sustainable, safe, fair and reliable energy system that contributes to lower GHG emissions.
In 2030, buildings in Rotterdam will emit less GHG's.
In 2040, the urban mobility system by road and water will no longer emit GHG's.

9
The domains are outlined across 17 transition pathways, each accompanied by corresponding actions. A portion of these actions has been already translated into specific projects, which are detailed in the Climate Action Plan Rotterdam. The coherence between the transition paths and their respective actions is illustrated below. In the accompanying figures, black text represents existing policy, while red text highlights identified policy gaps that we intend to address.

# B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

As explained, we are realigning our pathways and update policies and portfolio of actions for the next administration. the climate neutrality portfolio design is shown above, and details can be found in the KAR (Annex 1) and the current portfolio of actions (annex 2).
# B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

Our KAR is updated every half year to monitor and discuss progress with our Council to evaluate and take further action. Monitoring of progress during current administrative period (2022-2026) as enshrined in our budget's Planning &amp; Control Cycle uses the following indicators:

Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

In this section, Part C “Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030” we aim to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organizational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations –to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified Module A-2 and A-3.

## Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

As stated, to address all the barriers and opportunities, strengthening multi-level cooperation, between layers of government, cities, and actors within cities is needed. The joint effort of all European cities in the mission clarifies what the barriers to acceleration are and what solutions are needed for this at the European, national and local levels.

## National level

On the national level, one barrier is the multi-level governance which is still quite sectoral focused on the energy transition while the step towards Climate Neutrality (as shown in A-3) requires addressing multiple issues (spatial development and social in general) which are otherwise barriers for this transition. On top we see many other challenges which are not yet adequately addressed and part of multi-level governance, with clear pathways and goals (f.e. adaptation, circularity) which should also be dresses so we can more utilize co-benefits when investing in the energy transition. These considerations have currently no platform.

So we are delighted that because of this mission the National Cooperation Structure (NSS) has been set up so we as cities can take the lead to put forward actions and solutions to address the,

## European Union

The mission label given to cities for the climate contract will help finalize the financial framework for our sustainable transitions and promote cooperation here. Through this enhanced collaboration and pooled innovation and scale-up power, we aim to achieve accelerated implementation of our current strategies. Currently however, it takes a long time before EU-legislation and finance are reaching cities (plus 6, 7 years).

So to accelerate and make this all possible, sharing the right data and information between them, which is one of the purposes of this CCC, is preconditional. Using the same data and exchanging them on an intelligible way is key to coordinate and collaborate. As this CCC already makes clear this concerns a lot of different and a vast amount of data. From our local experience this means digitalization is key to do this more efficient and on time but setting it up requires a lot of work.

So, to move forward, we intend working within the NSS to reflect on all the data, including all the parts contained in the CCC, so to agree how we are progressing towards digitalisation of our data. From our experience, this on itself will result in a flywheel to more standardisation and development of the preconditions that are necessary for data driven action, covering aspects like organisation, policy goals and indicators, finance and governance structures. This will have to be a joint effort to be helpful and successful. Rotterdam has a lot of experience and invested on this issue. So, we think, utilising all the strengths and differences between the relevant stakeholders, towards this we have much to contribute. We would be very happy if the European Commission also joint this endeavour regarding the next iterations on the CCC.

Figure 20: Governance structure Rotterdam.

# Municipal

We have recently created a more programmatic governance structure for the energy transition and other cross-departmental issues. This will enhance the capabilities for this mission (which is lead by the department of Sustainability) to more effectively cooperate on this mission. Also we have created a WHAT and HOW tables when issues arise addressing multiple programmes, on policy (what) and implementation and execution (how) to foster more holistic and integral approach towards multiple linked issues. So it will be easier to collaborate on our long-term strategy for the development of our city.

# Module C-2 Social Innovation Interventions

In A.3.3 we have listed the social innovation interventions that are currently being executed in Rotterdam. In 2026 a new administration will be elected. We will evaluate which social innovation interventions the new administration can deploy. But as been pointed out to us, our current set-up of our KAR, a user friendly digital and easy to understand monitoring of our progress and actions can bee judged as quite an innovation. We would encourage the reader not (only) to look at the paper version here in the annex 2 as part of the CCC but to experience it's look and feel about how we inform and engage with our citizens this way and frequently update about progress and new actions, to foster further collaborative action.

# Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the CCC Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for refining the CCC Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract in future iterations.

We have made the following considerations and choices for the purpose of this CCC:

Scope: we decided to focus in the CCC on the energy transition in the city, excluding targeting the emissions of the Port of Rotterdam area where the industry and the (fossil) energy sector is present. Observing the progress so far and being conscious of the limited influence of the municipality compared to the leading role of the national government and role of the EU, it's questionable whether the mission in its current approach and set-up is the right vehicle for change. We also do not include circular (scope3), biodiversity or climate adaptation goals and policies, unless in relationship with the energy transition. While they are of utmost importance, we are choosing to go for coherence instead of being overly complete for the purpose of this CCC and the mission in general. This can change in the future in relationship to the establishment and/or progress of other missions.

Goals: for 2030 no intermediate goal has yet been set specifically for the city, besides the overall -55% for the whole city. Regarding climate neutrality, there are goals set for mobility for 2040 and for the rest, mainly the Built environment in 2050. The moment of submitting this CCC coincides with

a) the preparation of the incoming administration in 2026
b) the preparation of new national measures by the national government to (still) reach the national goal in 2030, as well establishing a goal for 2035 as obligated to do by the national Climate Law, and
c) the negotiations on the proposed EU target of -90% in 2040.

This al has led us to the conclusion it is prudent to use the CCC as a starting point of preparation for the new administration, giving them the opportunity to establish an ambitious but feasible target with the further support this mission offers. To prepare, it's in our situation of utmost importance we can take these multilevel developments into consideration when we strategize what is wise. As we did in preparation for the current and previous administration, we are starting now to prepare new scenario's, policy options and an estimate of the needed investments.

In addition, many of the current policies and associated action plans are set to contribute towards a target set for 2030, while some even stop in 2026. As a consequence, policies targeting the emissions beyond, for a big part are in the middle in the process of being updated, which are essential in complementing our portfolio of actions for the periods beyond. The earlier mentioned barrier on the short term also forces us to reevaluate and update certain policies. When the new administration announces their plans, we can update the CCC accordingly.

Pathways: Since the admission of the CCC is for a part meant as an evaluation moment, an analysis has taken place to identify which pathways were not addressed in our KAR (as shown in section B). We performed a 'gap analysis', identifying the consistency between our policies, identified pathways and actions. On basis of the results, we have realigned our current pathways and added new ones as input for the policy shaping process. This will guide us further into updating our KAR (with new pathways, establishing intermediate and end goals, actions, stakeholder engagement and investments) in preparation for the incoming administration. Based on the choices the new administration makes; we will adjust the CCC.

Portfolio of actions: our current portfolio of actions is part of the baseline. Therefore, we did not (yet) classify them in terms of levers of change and represent them in B-2, but as part of our current Climate Action Plan Rotterdam (KAR, Annex 1). As stated
earlier, we are still dealing with a gap in 2030 based on the effect of our current portfolio of actions. We did not present a portfolio of actions capable of targeting this gap, since the only available options concerns scaling up current ones, where barriers prevent them now.

Based on the gap analysis we did encounter established pathways without established actions, which need further exploring before they can be established as part of our portfolio of actions, as listed the KAR. In our next CCC we will add the actions that we have added to our portfolio of actions.

The first 8,000 homes are off natural gas. Only circular sewage pipes are going into the ground. 45% of household waste is already separated. Rotterdam won an international award for its good charging infrastructure.

We are making considerable headway for the climate and people in the city. We can be quite proud of that. With everyone's efforts, we have managed to ensure that CO2 emissions in the city are no longer rising; they have started to decline. We have made a good start, but the task in the coming years is big, very big. By 2030, CO2 emissions must fall by 55% and by 2050 we must be climate-neutral. The year 2030 seems far away, but it is fast approaching. A future-proof city starts now. To insulate a house the day after tomorrow, get an energy bill down, put ships on shore power or find well-qualified staff, we have to act today.

We care about the many Rotterdammers who experience health problems due to air pollution. For the families struggling with energy poverty. To the residents of neighbourhoods where it gets 8 degrees hotter in summer than in green neighbourhoods. 7 out of 10 Rotterdammers are concerned about climate change, according to the 2022 Omnibus Survey.

Rotterdam wants to lead the way because its residents cannot be left behind. By investing in the energy and raw materials transition, we create opportunities. A port city that relies less on fossil energy can strengthen its leading position in the world and remain a major job engine. An insulated house with solar panels gneh residents less financial headaches. With smart actions around pollutants, noise and waste, we can soon pass on a cool, dry and clean city to our children and grandchildren.

The Rotterdam Climate Action Plan (KAR) maps out what we have all already achieved, but is also honest and transparent about what we all still have to do. The urgency is high. In this document we list the main issues. It makes clear that many new initiatives and additional investments are needed. Only then can we achieve the goals set for this parliamentary term, 2030 and 2050. Some goals are still missing and require decisions.

It is clear that we all have to put our shoulders to the wheel to make the KAR a reality; Rotterdammers, housing corporations, energy companies, the port, businesses and schools, as well as the central government and the European Union, are key players.

The municipality itself is putting its best foot forward. It is not always easy, as strong choices are required around space, money, capacity and priority. With an eye and ear for everyone's interests. The college is making every effort to do the maximum from all portfolios. Exactly what this college stands for: we are one city. Together we can do this.

Energy transition

The energy transition goal: 55% CO reduction by 2030. We got off to a flying start, halting the rise in CO emissions. The graph shows the movement downwards. That is a wonderful achievement, but there is still much to do.

![img-41.jpeg](img-41.jpeg)
Totale $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-ultstest Stad

In the port and in the city, we are pulling out all the stops to realise our ambitions. In the part, the ball is in the court of the big companies and the State. For this, see the 'golf section in the Kilifi'.

![img-42.jpeg](img-42.jpeg)

![img-43.jpeg](img-43.jpeg)

![img-44.jpeg](img-44.jpeg)

In the city, the role of the municipality is greater. By deeding, selling frameworks and driving, in the coming years we will continue the obtained reduction to -20% in 2020. That means it 211 Mton of urban emissions in 4 years, implementing the current plans is not enough, because why with additional actions will we reach the targets in 2030. To know whether we are and remain on the right track, the DCMR calculates all measures towards 2030 once a year.

The DCMR also establishes once a year what the actual emissions were in the province year. The latest report can be found below. Once the new calculations are ready, we will incorporate them into the 4000.

For the college, energy transition is not about technology, but about making the city future-proof for its residents. How we will give hands and feet to this, you can read in the sections below.

## Clean, sustainable and robust energy supply

In floderden, the number of solar panels and wind turbines is growing rapidly. The energy system must develop along with them to avoid grid gridbolt. floderden is investing now to reap the benefits in the future.

## Over 40%

![img-45.jpeg](img-45.jpeg)

![img-46.jpeg](img-46.jpeg)

## Built environment

Floderdenmores want to live, shop and work in buildings that are pleasant, healthy and affordable. By 2000, every building should be natural gas-free and CO-free. The municipality, businesses, owner-occupiers, private landlords and housing corporations put their books into this goal.

## Good 40%

## Mobility

Floderden is a city on the move. Working towards the climate goals must simultaneously improve accessibility, air quality and spatial quality. This requires a different mobility system for people and geeds.

## Good 40%

![img-47.jpeg](img-47.jpeg)

## Port of the future

On the world stage, the port of Floderden is a major player. To remain significant, it must develop into a sustainable port with a 55% CO2 recovery by 2030 and CO2 neutrality by 2050. But also a fully circular industry by 2050. This is a major challenge, as the industry is now mainly petroleum-based.

# Commodity transition

The Circular programme focuses on developing a circular economy: an economic system in which Rotterdam uses raw materials, materials and products as efficiently as possible throughout the chain. Much of Rotterdam's co-entraisons are caused by the use of raw materials and materials. A circular economy therefore contributes significantly to redazag (100% of the total) by 2030, the municipality aims to reduce the use of minerals, metals and food raw materials by 50%. By 2050, Rotterdam will be fully circular.

## What have we already done?

We are working on three main chains: Construction, Organic Streams and Consumer Goods(s), and we are targeting three over groups: Municipal clients and buyers, Entrepreneurs and Rotterdammers. We expect to make the biggest impact within these agendas. Here are some examples of projects we have implemented: We introduced material passports, enabling the reuse of materials from construction projects.
We carried out life-cycle analyses to show the environmental impact of products purchased by the municipality.
We started clean collection of leaf waste, which is used to make bokashi.
We have conducted experiments to reduce food waste, such as the "The New Aish" programme.
The Circular Counter is ready to help companies with questions about circular business.

We collaborated with chain partners in textile production, repair and recycling.

![img-50.jpeg](img-50.jpeg)

## What are the ongoing projects?

We are working to use raw materials less, better, longer and again. For example:

We look at vegetation in the MAH area and in Reyeroord to see which plants grow well on different types of soil. This helps with saving management costs and so we use fewer plants, resources, water, soil and transport.
We are working with Rotterdam schools on 'circular craftsmanship', through which students learn more about designing and maintaining products so that fewer raw materials are needed.
We help SMEs, start-ups and scale-ups that (went to) innovate circularly with information, advice networking and access to (co)funders.

We also support initiatives by people in the neighbourhood, such as repair cafes, clothing swaps and second-hand sales.

For more projects, see the Rotterdam Circular 2023 - 2028 programme plan:

To cofounderscircular.nl

## What remains to be done?

Rotterdam Circular promotes circular thinking and action in the city, both within our own organisation and beyond. Our projects serve as tools to achieve this goal: we carry out projects with the aim of making circular thinking and acting the standard. To this end, we join forces with partners in the city. By getting to work practically, we learn what does and does not work in practice. We will increase this movement in the coming years.

## Do-thought approach

Projects also help us to find new ideas that ensure we can use resources less, longer, better and again. We use what we learn from our practical experience to make the big changes that are needed. We call this the Do Thinker approach. With this approach, we try to make circular thinking and doing more widely known and more firmly embedded. In short: we want circular thinking and acting to become normal.

Municipality paid for good example

# Municipality sets good example

![img-52.jpeg](img-52.jpeg)

Of course, we are also reducing our own footprint. Our ambition is to reduce CO2 emissions by 55% by 2030. This starts, among other things, with the sustainable management of our real estate and vehicle fleet. As a next step, we as a municipality also want to make agreements with partners, such as suppliers and contractors, to make the chain more sustainable.

The LSS Performance Ladder shows annually what we have achieved within the real estate managed by the municipality. The public figures on energy consumption and CO2 emissions stimulate us to make continuous improvements.

## Municipal property

The municipality uses many buildings. We have two goals for making our real estate more sustainable:

By 2030, we aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 55%. We will replace or renovate around 250 municipal buildings to extend their lifespan. Especially buildings with a poor energy label will be tackled. But beware, these new and renovated buildings are not yet energy-neutral. We do want to achieve that by 2050.
By 2050, we want to achieve a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions. This is currently not possible because we currently only have enough money for normal maintenance, renovation and new construction that complies with current laws and regulations, with a small focus on sustainability (e.g. BREEAM Good or GPR 7.5).

## What have we already done?

The Property Department heeft created a list of sustainable criteria and added it to the Property Framework Memorandum. To ensure that sustainability becomes an important part of projects, we should use this list at the beginning of the project to make decisions about which sustainable goals best fit what we want to achieve.

![img-53.jpeg](img-53.jpeg)

Onderweg naar een volledig uitstootvrij wegenpark

## Own fleet

The municipality's vehicles are highly visible in the city. By 2030, we want to operate with a zero-emission vehicle fleet, this will also improve air quality, which is why we are accelerating. We are doing this in three steps:

End 2023: all passenger cars (including two-wheelers) emission-free. By 1 January 2024, 100%* emission-free.
End 2025: all light commercial vehicles zero emissions. By 1 January 2024, 57% were emission-free.
End 2030: all heavy vehicles tools and tool carriers zero emissions. By 1 January 2024, 17% of all heavy vehicles were emission-free. Of all tools and tool carriers, 93% are emission-free by 1 January 2024.

* except for a low hybrid cars.

Emission-free vehicles that fall under the 'heavy' category are priory. Yet the municipality considers it a worthwhile investment for climate and city. Especially as we expect companies to comply with rules in the Zero Emission City Logistics (ZEO) zone.

## Joining forces

The climate goals are very challenging. Making plans is good, but making plans happen is better. If all parties involved join forces, it will succeed. Thus, the Rotterdam Climate Boosters challenge organisations to start concrete projects around sustainability and circular economy.

## Involving residents

We make our city more sustainable together. Residents are involved through the Rotterdam Citizens' Climate Council and neighbourhood councils. The municipality also supports resident initiatives, such as helping local residents with the energy allowance or teaching them how to apply window fail. Involved residents build with the municipality.

![img-56.jpeg](img-56.jpeg)

![img-57.jpeg](img-57.jpeg)

## Money for green

Municipality goals targeted money to accelerate sustainability. Technical innovation that stimulates employment. Greening that makes the city cooler. Insulation for homes that reduces energy bills. Driving circular economy that saves resources. The Sustainability Transition Budget (STB) and the Energy Transition Fund (ETF) help Rotterdam move forward.

## Sustainable jobs

Building a greener Rotterdam requires a lot of doing and thinking. The labour market shortage is a stumbling block. That is why the municipality is committed to sustainable jobs. Everyone is of value and welcome. Young people with a talent for technology, enthusiastic lateral entrants and people who can do more than they think.

![img-58.jpeg](img-58.jpeg)

![img-59.jpeg](img-59.jpeg)

## Control of space

Space in the city is limited. Above geued and below geued. The municipality directs space so as to create coherence with other spatial tasks. For instance, the construction of the heat network is tackled together with sewer replacement or greening whenever possible. In this way, energy transition can be an accelerator for all tasks.

## Lobby

The energy transition can only succeed if the government and the EU create the right framework conditions. As far as we are concerned, affordability for the Rotterdammer comes first. The municipality regularly visits The Hague to achieve the best for residents and city. In addition, Rotterdam cooperates with other European cities and we are one of the 100 Climate Neutral Cities.

The Rotterdam Climate Action Plan (KAR) shows how the municipality is working towards a climate-neutral Rotterdam by 2050. We are open about the results we are achieving. We are realistic about the things that still have to happen.

The KAR charts what we are already doing. The conclusion: the policy is ambitious and implementation is picking up steam, but to achieve our goals in 2030 and 2050, we need to roll up our sleeves even more. That is why we will make and implement more plans. We will do this together with the city, because the climate belongs to everyone.

The KAR is of and for the people of Rotterdam. Together, we keep our finger on the pulse. In the KAR we will include climate projects by the neighbourhood councils, the Rotterdam Citizens' Climate Consultative Committee and by the Rotterdam Climate Booster with partners in the city.

The KAR also makes it clear that the municipality has too few financial resources and powers to implement all plans properly and quickly. We use the KAR to try to influence new developments from the central government and the European Union, so that they provide maximum support for the projects in Rotterdam.

The KAR is a living action plan, landing new ideas from the city and tracking the progress of projects. The KAR is updated regularly. This way, we keep each other on our toes and together we can achieve the best for residents and city.

# Clean, sustainable and robust energy supply

Indirect CO2 emissions from our urban electricity and heat use decreased sharply in recent years after peaking in 2016. This is because we in the Netherlands started producing more electricity with green energy sources and divested fossil energy sources.

Wind and solar projects in Rotterdam have contributed to the greening of this national energy mix in recent years.

![img-62.jpeg](img-62.jpeg)
CO₂-uitstoot stedelijke elektriciteit &amp; warmtegebruik

The energy transition is happening at breakneck speed. Rotterdam not only wants to follow the developments closely, but above all wants to be a leader. In the city and the port, we are already generating green energy with 389,000 solar panels and 68 wind turbines. In addition, heeh Rotterdam has a strong starting position in the further development of the district heating network and we have many alternative heat sources at our disposal. We are also working together with heat companies and network operators on a reliable and smart energy system.

This way, all Rotterdammers can reap the benefits of the energy transition. This is how we turn threats into opportunities for the city.

## The role of the municipality

For a clean, sustainable and robust energy supply, the municipality encourages and facilitates the development and use of renewable energy sources. In addition, we encourage production and transport of green hydrogen and investigate the possibilities for nuclear energy. We do this together with residents and companies in the city and in the port. With grid manager Stedin, we are working on a strategic agenda to prevent grid congestion or reduce its effects. We encourage innovations in the energy system to take the final step towards implementation in Rotterdam.

# Solar

Robertson wants to become a leader in solar energy. These are the steps we (will) take:

March 2022, the counter stand at 0.7 km² — 380,000 solar panels.
March 2023, the counter stand at 1.1 km² — 690,000 solar panels.
The target for 2020 is 3.3 km² — 1,770,000 solar panels.
The target for 2030 is 2.4 km² — 1,980,000 solar panels.

![img-63.jpeg](img-63.jpeg)

If we push hard, we will achieve our contribution to the Robertson Get-Haag-Required Energy Strategy. Happy 2.4 km² panels by 2030 are safe as 2029. It makes sense to get a head start, as national targets for solar energy, we likely to be raised after 2030.

We can realize this solar addition by adding every new backbone, on company multi, along highways, along municipal infrastructure and on car paths. We also encourage residents' initiatives in cooperation with small-scale projects.

## What have we already done?

Initial successes have been achieved on several fronts:

Are on road's roof facades
Success in the new Wellness channel, accelerating the installation of 48,000 (0.11 km²) solar panels on a distance to/from well solar panels. Energy has Rotterdam's expertise. 30,000 solar panels have so far been installed on municipal real estate, two pilots with solar facades have been carried out and a collection solar panel purchasing campaign was i.e. a 1.1 km² 4 early 2004

So far we end along infrastructure
The pilot/many study on solar energy along the A10/4.00 stretch has been completed. As full-solar variants, a permit application has been submitted for the car park of a sports club, and we are also in talks about possible solar variants at some other locations.

But we tend and water
Solar term Dunappeller, solar development, construction start Schiebroek solar farm early 2024.

## Which projects are still ongoing?

The Solar Energy in Rotterdam 2022 - 2026 programme aims to help citizens, businesses and institutions retain solar panels. An important point of attention is making solar energy accessible to federal&amp;state residents about a sort of with a small budget. We also stimulate collective node with solar panels by energy cooperatives, which residents can join.

The Rotterdam solar ladder goes direction of the municipality's commitment:

But on north and facades use
Solar on end along infrastructure. Yes, if soils and responsible
Solar on water and land. No, others.

These are the opportunities we can exploit for 2026, totalling as much as 3.2 km² solar panels:

1.5 km² on roofs and facades: complex roofs, collective roofs, schools, municipal properties, housing associations, VCEs and private individuals.
0.4 km² on end along infrastructure. Let the Sun Show, Solar Esquires and OBR.
0.2 km² on water and land. Danappeller, Schiebroek.
1.1 km² existing solar panels

## What is left for us to do?

Sometimes citizens or businesses encounter barriers when installing solar panels. That is why the municipality is creating the optimal precondition for all parties who want to contribute with the Solar Energy in Rotterdam 2022-2026 programme.

Points of interest:

Circularity of solar panels: solar panels are currently not easy to recycle.
There must be enough space on the congested power grid to a 1.1 m² or a 1.4 m² solar panel.
We want to grant balance between different purposes
on roofs: solar, grooming, water storage and residential.

Notes: * Energy translation: Energy supply * Wind energy

# Wind energy

The municipality of Rotterdam has its a preference for energy from wind at sea. We honour existing agreements to allow the wind farms on Rotterdam territory. Wind turbines in the city already generate 30.7 megawatts annually. In the port 320.2 megawatts. This is equivalent to the energy output of 560,000 solar panels.

![img-64.jpeg](img-64.jpeg)

# What have we already done?

The city-required coverant (2012) and the port coverant (2006) contain agreements to generate at least 300 megawatts of wind energy. These targets are also part of the regional antidiscos for sustainable generation in 2000, as set out in the RDS 1.0 (1 July 2001). Our preference is for offshore wind farms, but we honour these existing agreements on positive wind.

# Which projects are still ongoing?

Now will the 300 megawatts of wind energy by 2030 (set out in RDS 1.0) be realized? The city-region coverant is to deliver 190 megawatts annually by 2030, of which wind turbines with a total capacity of at least 60 megawatts are planned on Rotterdam's territory. Decided into five locations: Hoekselaan, Chertokes-Poort, Rozenburg, Beierkuijden and Nieuwe Weterweg.

|  Report #Project # (1999) | Prior time to period (y/n/year) | Potential value (year of investment) | Status  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Hoekselaan (nonlinear in/blending, Nieuwe Weterweg) | 0 | 10 | Responding to an energy level of 100 megawatts per year (2012)  |
|  Chertokes-Poort | 1 | 5 | Stable  |
|  In/blending (nonlinear/blending) | 1 | 6 | Responding to an energy level of 100 megawatts per year (2012)  |
|  Beierkuijden | 1/10 | 22 | Stable  |
|  Nieuwe Weterweg | 4 | 24 | Recruitment in 2001  |

# Potential future

This final number of RDS deposits, among other things, on the number of turbines and the available turbine gas. In this case each vertical double, including a line that is nonconvex, guide target and control within 48 intervals the installed and power capacity, and on the other hand, the power capacity is not used, and, after purchasing the turbine.

The port coverant includes an agreement to generate at least 300 megawatts of wind power. The port area now has 320.2 megawatts of installed capacity.

Wind turbines affect the environment. To achieve good integration, the municipality considers process participation (with neighbourhood councils, focus groups, residents and other stakeholders) and financial participation (local ownership and energy cooperatives) important.

# What is left for us to do?

Environmentally aware wind energy development requires additional municipal effort for the wind farms in procedure and those yet to be developed. In doing so, we focus on a combination of public participation and communication. The 30wkdam in Haan van Holland is an example of a RDS 1.0 research location.

The new national standards for cretinics wind placement were published in draft form at the end of 2003. We take their impact on wind farms under development into account. 4 × 5 + 6 = 0 g a stable electricity grid requires agreements with grid operators, the Port Authority and other stakeholders.

# Energy system

Rotterdam's energy system is going through a sea change in the coming years. We are building a clean, smart, reliable and fair energy system, of which the electricity grid is an important part. The 'One City' coalition agreement has a clear ambition: new residents and businesses should not have to queue for a power socket. Meanwhile, that is unfortunately the case for part of our city and port. The high gas price is one of the factors accelerating the switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. It is an extra motivation to work with grid operators and companies to make Rotterdam's energy system grow along with the transition.

# What have we already done?

We have a clear picture of what the future energy system must meet. Network operators and companies are already building the system. As a municipality, we encourage innovation and new applications in the energy system through the Smart Energy Systems programme.

# Which projects are still ongoing?

To prevent clogging of the electricity grid, the municipality heeft deelnord to the study of the energy system. This also calls for new technology. That is why we are reopening the innovation subsidy scheme of the Smart Energy Systems programme twice in 2024. Because there are many entrepreneurs with smart ideas to tackle the problems in the energy system. Funds have also been made available from the DTB to help entrepreneurs deal flexibly with their energy consumption.

We are working with partners and co-governments to shape the Energy System of the Future. We do this in the Regional Energy Strategy (RES), by facilitating landfall of offshore wind and participating in the provincial and national Multiyear Energy and Climate Investment Programme (MIEK).

For the possible construction of two new nuclear power plants, the State is conducting research and starting a participation and communication process. The municipality will contribute as part of the EIA commissioned by the central government.

# What is left for us to do?

Rotterdam faced power grid tightness in 2022. Demand for electricity rose much faster than expected, especially in the port. High-voltage grid operator TenneT announced in October 2023 that it will definitely not be able to meet the increasing demand until the grid is upgraded. It is TenneT's responsibility to respond properly to electricity demand. Hard work is being done by TenneT to expand capacity, but this will only provide a structural solution from 2030 onwards.

There are quite a few challenges ahead. Above and below ground, there must be sufficient space for transformer stations, pipes and cables. Many and well-trained staff are needed. Sometimes laws and regulations are a bump in the road. Municipality and grid operators need to strengthen and improve their cooperation so that together they can meet the challenges.

# Heat system

Heating buildings and tap water with natural gas will no longer be allowed from 2050. That is why we are working on alternative heating systems. One example is the district heating network. New and existing sources, such as geothermal heat and residual heat, feed this network. Rotterdam has a good starting position. We have many heat sources and the municipality has been working on heat networks since 2006. Now we need to expand the heat grid and expand the number of sustainable heat sources so that we can connect more and more homes and buildings. The WAT map geeh by neighbourhood what the best alternative to natural gas is. In cooperation with TNO, we are sharpening this map.

# What have we already done?

Further development of the heat grid is challenging. In 2006/2007, the municipality issued several concessions for the construction, management and operation of the network in part of Rotterdam. However, time has not stood still. Therefore, we are in talks with heat companies and developers to determine the best route for the future. This is especially important in the light of the new Collective Heat Supply Act (Wcw).

As a municipality, we can often be found at the Ministry of Economic Affairs in The Hague. Thinking along about good preconditions at the national level is important. Our knowledge and experience in making neighbourhoods natural gas-free is valued by the government when drafting laws, regulations and financial instruments.

The New Heat Road (DNWW) supplies the heat network with residual heat from the port area and AVR. This pipeline was owned by Warmtebedrijf Rotterdam (WbR), but was sold to Vattenfall in autumn 2022.

# Which projects are still ongoing?

The municipality is working on a smart strategy for the development of the heat and cold system in Rotterdam. In it, we safeguard public interests, address the challenge of finding sufficient space above and below ground and make clear the financial consequences of choices.

We are also preparing for new legislation expected in 2025: the Collective Heat Supply Act (Wcw) and the Municipal Instruments Heat Transition Act (Wgiw).

This new legislation involves a lot of work. For instance, a Plot Plan must be drawn up that divides Rotterdam into heat plots. A heat plot is a defined area for which the municipality appoints a heat company that must connect all buildings in the plot to a heat network. Adapting all current concessions, agreements and contracts to the Wcw is also a big job.

So we will need to adopt some policies in this area. Future policy documents:

WAT map 3.0 - understanding heat demand, alternatives to natural gas (2025).
Rotterdam Plot Plan (2025).
Resource and infrastructure strategy (2025). Transition
paths (2025).
Heat programme 2026 (2026).

# What is left for us to do?

In the coming years, it is important to expand the heat network and make it more sustainable. This requires different legislation as well as substantial investments in new sources, building infrastructure, insulating buildings and replacing existing natural gas connections with a clean alternative.

For this, a contribution from the state is indispensable.

# Built environment

Homes, shops and offices must be liveable, healthy and affordable. By 2050, the built environment must be natural gas-free and climate-neutral. The necessary measures are costly and far-reaching. Not only in the outdoor space, but also behind the front door. This requires proper consultation with residents, owners and entrepreneurs. Higher gas prices are an extra incentive to speed up. Rotterdammers want to press on for lower energy bills and a healthy and affordable home, but they also want inconvenience to be limited and the city to remain accessible.

## CO2 in the built environment

For the built environment, CO2 emissions are decreasing compared to 1990 by better insulating buildings, making them natural gas-free or replacing them with new construction. New construction is already natural gas-free as standard today.

## The role of the municipality

The municipality of Rotterdam is doing a lot to make the city natural gas-free and climate-neutral. To this end, it is working with the city on plans and projects.

The municipality encourages people to use less energy, insulate their homes and become natural gas-free. The municipality geeft information and subsidies and helps where necessary. But in the end, people decide whether they want to change their homes, as the owner decides.

## Natural gas-free

By 2050, natural gas should no longer be used to heat buildings and domestic hot water.

[Read more]

## Energy saving

The built environment must be climate neutral by 2050. By 2030, 97,000 homes must be insulated by owners (based on the National Insulation Programme).

[Read more]

## Energy poverty

The municipality seeks to alleviate energy poverty with a wide range of help on saving, remodeling and changing.

[Read more]

## New building

By 2030, Rotterdam must build 55,000 new homes to solve the housing shortage. It is important that these new homes are sustainable and energy-efficient.

[Read more]

## SMEs, businesses and offices

Rotterdam heeft 20.000 SMEs op een aardseidige en 43 business parks (excluding sea and airport parks) en 47 shopping areas. To meet the targets for the built environment, the municipality must provide maximum encouragement and support to SMEs in the energy transition.

# What have we already done?

Making existing neighbourhoods natural gas-free is a challenging job. The municipality has a general useful experience in several neighbourhoods.

In Harralyk, around 300 homes will have been addressed by 2022. The remaining homes will be connected to district heating in 2024.
In Boqratibin Tussent@ion, about 650 homes have been connected so far. Another 800 homes will follow in 2024-2029.
In Fesoborim-Zad and Skyamont-West, building owners received offers to switch to district heating in 2021. Both approaches have been on pause. P a r t i y - due to developments around the Niswan Wannitawag (DNNW) and Yatbollah's investment freeze due to the Collective Heat Supply Act (Wss). Before the summer, implementation will start in the first clusters. Discussions are still taking place with Yatbollah about the remaining clusters. We expect clarify on this soon.
Prissedand-Het Lage Land is undergoing a tender process. This process has temporarily stopped because we are waiting for talks with Eneco about new agreements on heat in a larger area. More clarify on this will be available during 2024.
In Rosenburg, we are relaunching the area approach after it has long been stalled due to the sale of DNNW. We are doing so according to the new Wow with an exploration of a more public route.

Want an inside look at area approaches? Then you can read more here.

# What current projects are there?

There is still a lot of work to do, but new projects need extra money. The coalition programme states that we will finish ongoing area approaches to natural gas-free and start now ones only when the government comes up with funding. Therefore, many areas from the Heat Transition Vision are unplanned.

Meanwhile, the municipality does support market initiatives in Oude Noorden-Agnieesbuurt, Schatornek, Ommoord and the Kop van Paasneel. We are also preparing for the introduction of new legislation on making neighbourhoods natural gas-free. See the Heat System chapter.

# What remains to be done?

Natural gas-free approaches face heatwinds. With the new Collective Heat Supply Act (Wss), our heat companies still want to invest? How much delay is caused by Yatbollah and Eneco's investment freeze? Can we have a new new Eneco's opportunities? Or only reserve space underground for a future heat network? Are there enough professionals to s a r i y, but the work? And will the central government come up with enough money to make natural gas-free affordable for everyone?

At the same time, we have gained a lot of experience from ongoing area approaches and are poised to m o r e. forward. Our partners in the city also want to move forward. With the right framework conditions, we can go ahead with this.

# Energy saving

The built environment must be closely covered by 3000. The creeds a big task for the treating stock. There are 20 000 homes in the UK, 50 000, 20 000 homes (and an insurable dispute on the National Insurance Programme). This large task must be met by three target groups: owner- and public (20 000 family), treating associations (20 000 friends) and private residents (2 000 family). The intermediate target for the project is a radiologist, a clinical team, a professional and an international team taken the first treatment stage in the field of energy saving. To meet the 2000 target, an accelerometer by a doctor of the emergency treating association are arriving next to the project. The potential problem is ground to be the need for the necessary knowledge and training of behaviour approach for this.

![img-67.jpeg](img-67.jpeg)

In flammable, these are one 10,000 hazardous oil fumes (AOF), about a third of flammable burning stock in the UK. The AOF is selected eight groups, with all values contained target groups are in either a AOF. The lowest selling oil is declared offhold and released automatically in the ground when offered was 100,000. This is also the municipality's highest global value.

# What have we already done?

In recent years, the municipality has taken many actions to help the four aforementioned target groups make their homes more sustainable.

# Impact on public

The municipality itself has been seeking an insulating home in recent years with development such as New York House. Power for your home and an apparent targeting garden areas. Peaceful treatment practice, but we need to accommodate in real use 3000 targets.

# Private residents

By providing fieldwork, we need common or special care at least one dwelling in flammable. The municipality has not yet declared any sustainability program for the target group.

# Training associations

The setting approved and the community houses with requirements on housing associations which is within or mainly their homes more sustainable. Relative training time associated with sustainability is only one of the most interesting activities in the area. The community is responsible and maintenance of homes. A target total in which every such must be weighted up.

# General associations

AOFs are supported by the municipality's medical team. They are approved from 2000 AOFs outside the country's reference and insured. AOFs will be more robust for sustainability and offered advice and support from AOFs. They may also be responsible for the home safety activities.

# Which projects are still ongoing?

In 2009, the municipality intensifies the approval towards the four target groups.

# Owner-accidents

We continue with even specific insurance actions, both in areas with natural gas that place and found in the house especially on neighbourhoods with many homes with a poor energy state. There will be an extra subsidy from the municipality. We also want to cooperate with insurance initiatives here.

We are supporting a big stake effective insurance coverage. The aim is to get around 4,000 owner-accidents to create a increase in insurance coverage.

The council's Energy Society is doing strategies to discuss our help and support and source. A non-paying tool used to do early job interviewers or those who want to be completely uninvolved.

# Private residents

In 2010, Parliament City Council and a council were also dissolved, established the Peabody Parkers and Visitors Association (PAPVA). We are supporting options to accelerate sustainability. We do this by causing other things: installing between residents and residents, providing advice and support for private residents, and developing communication tools that can be tested, used.

# Housing associations

Together with housing associations, we are working to implement performance agreements on insulating their homes. In addition, housing associations and the municipality are working together on an active plan to remove insurance in sustainability.

# General associations

We are going to further develop the 10% AOFs advice state so that we can support 10% more better with the existing health system. Others take each step to identify their buildings more sustainable and come here for answers. Information and an advice and support process.

# What is left for us to do?

It is clear that there is a lot to be done (making up to 2000 and 3000. Below are the challenges by target group.

# General occupation

General occupation can not yet be present in industry. That gold is major defense of our environment. General labour, work, and labor needs to be the target group. It is an industry that the workplace and a foreign person is there. As that are not up to date a challenge but at a fundamental state, the industry is not at all free to do.

For the same reason approval is coming, serving, etc only have energy for 3000 people. The 3000 people are very special among the two people, but they will not be enough for the best people. By the way, owner-occupation has to pay for a large sum of the necessary observations.

# Private residents

The existing association is working on legislation to gradually become a major state group in products. How this will help shape and who will endorse it is still on duty.

# Housing associations

This will be government and the municipality are serving a changed individual of housing associations and a common in the area. The owner- and/or public (2000) housing association is an struggling with all the tasks, but they say they will must be 3000 people.

# Other/Not Available

The relative relationship burden on owner-occupation is high. Good housing and good public (2000). For the following years, we have to be able to work for a different area and to deliver the same financial contribution. We are in value and the government is coming into education.

# Energy poverty

Energy poverty has long been on the municipality's radar as a growing problem. The sharp rise in energy prices - partly due to the war in Ukraine - heah worsened the situation for many households. TNO research shows that energy poverty has increased in Rotterdam over the past two years. Energy poverty is particularly high in Usselmonde, Charlois, Delftshaven, Feijenoord and Noord.

The municipality seeks to alleviate energy poverty with a wide range of help-on saving, remodelling and changing.

## What have we already done?

In recent years, much attention has been paid to saving energy costs, as this directly reduces household bills. The results over 2023 are:

More than 6,000 households were visited by an energy handyman.
More than 1,200 low-income Rotterdam households received an energy-efficient appliance through the white goods fund.
161 households have been helped with a central heating system that is better balanced with the 'water-side adjustment' project. This results in a reduction in heating costs of 5 to 15% per household.
Almost 400 flats have already taken advantage of the subsidy scheme for VvEs with a maximum WOZ value of €300,000.

When it comes to insulating or renovating homes, it is mainly the housing corporations that are in charge. About 70% of Rotterdam's energy-poor households live in a housing corporation's house. Therefore, the municipality heah together with seven housing corporations show up an agreement to reduce the energy consumption of their tenants. This is done by launching additional projects and accelerating existing ones. This has already helped more than 2,300 households. The municipality heah warranted 49 million from state funds for this purpose.

## Which projects are still ongoing?

With financial support from the central government, the municipality is continuing its ongoing projects and starting some new initiatives. All projects have been discussed with the municipal council and approved by the college. Here are some targets for 2024:

Provide support to 17,500 households with an energy handyman in 2024 and 2025. Starting this year, the energy handyman will also perform tasks such as water-side adjustment, hanging curtains, replacing old ventilation boxes and installing soil foil.
Use an energy poverty crisis fund to finance initiatives by informal organisations that directly address energy poverty.
Provide support to 17,500 households with an energy handyman in 2024 and 2025. Starting this year, the energy handyman will also perform tasks such as water-side adjustment, hanging curtains, replacing old ventilation boxes and installing soil foil.
Explore options to re-provide energy-efficient white goods using SPUK funds. The city council will be informed by the end of the first quarter.
Continuing to offer energy coaching. The current contract runs until the end of April 2024, after which we are working on a new tender to extend the contract.
Provide support to 75 - 100 Owners' Associations with a subsidy for insulation measures.
Reach more than 5,000 tenants at housing associations with projects resulting from the covenant for the period from 2023 to 2025.

## What is left for us to do?

To tackle energy poverty, we should focus on three tracks: saving, rebuilding and changing.

Until now, the main focus has been on savings. For a sustainable approach to energy poverty, we also need to invest in large-scale insulation of homes of households in energy poverty (remodelling). Here, housing associations are important partners.

Poor housing-quality can lead to other problems, such as damp and mould, health problems and social isolation. Sustainable housing and an affordable energy system bring other positive changes besides lower energy costs.

By 2025, government funding for energy poverty will be exhausted. However, the municipality remains committed to fighting energy poverty in the city. After 2025, new budget is needed to ensure that this group is not forgotten. So far, nothing extra has been done for owners of ground-level housing affected by energy poverty. This concerns about 10% of the group of Rotterdammers who experience energy poverty.

# New building

Rotterdam needs to build 95,000 new homes by 2030 to solve the housing shortage. It is vital that these new homes accountableable and energy-efficient, which is not only comfortable for residents but also beneficial for the climate.

The material use and construction process of the houses are also important as they have a significant impact on the environment. With current traditional construction methods, CO2 emissions are about 340 kilograms per square metre. To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, we need to drastically reduce these emissions. For 'Paris-proof' construction, CO2 emissions would have to be reduced to:

200 kg CO per square metre for a single-family house; 220 kg
CO2 per square metre for a multi-family house.

# Nieuwbouw

![img-69.jpeg](img-69.jpeg)
Lampij 50 jaar vol voor CO₂ uitstoot buiten de Rotterdamse greuzen – maar verhelderend niet inclusief gel

![img-70.jpeg](img-70.jpeg)

If we build the 95,000 homes needed 'Paris-proof', we can reduce CO2 emissions by 5.50 megatons. As a municipality, we want to build according to the Paris Agreement now, but at the same time this should not slow down the construction task.

# What have we already done?

The Sustainable Area Development programme helps developers and project teams put and keep sustainability high on their agenda. For new construction projects, the municipality informs and encourages from the beginning to avoid delays further down the line.

In addition, the municipality team developed the Quickscan Sustainability, which gives project teams and developers insight into the municipality's sustainability ambitions. In 2022 and 2023, we supported around 60 new construction projects with tailored advice.

# Which projects are still ongoing?

Following the Doorbouwakkoord, we are working together with construction and real estate parties in Rotterdam on a plan of approach 'Sustainable Continuous Building' with the aim of 'Paris-proof' building.

In the coming years, we will discuss opportunities and obstacles in the development process, first solutions together and calculate the CO2 emissions of projects. We want to prepare for developments such as the EU Taxonomy and emission-free construction.

We have also signed the Clean and Emission Free Construction Covenant and will work on the use of cleaner machinery and equipment on and around construction sites. At the same time, Rotterdam is exploring the possibility of setting a CO2 budget per project and we want to experiment with a CO2 budget of area level.

# What is left for us to do?

The municipality will continue to share knowledge and provide advice. It is expected that legal requirements for new building plans in terms of sustainability will be further tightened in the coming years. Nationally, the scope for municipalities to set and require sustainability performance is drastically reduced. As the statutory sustainability requirements are lower than our sustainability ambitions, we need to lobby to retain this space or to help decide how and where this space could be linked, so that Rotterdam can continue to build future-proof and we retain perspective to achieve our climate-neutral ambitions for 2030 and 2050. It is becoming increasingly difficult to include sustainable measures in affordable housing given the high construction costs. Therefore, we are working on a subsidy scheme for initiators of sustainable building developments who could use a helping hand.

Mobility - Charging infrastructure as a prerequisite
Digital Verified

# Charging infrastructure as a prerequisite

Everyone in Rotterdam should be able to charge easily, whenever and wherever they need to. The challenge here is to realise the charging infrastructure with as little extra pressure on the city's electricity network as possible. The municipality and the grid operator are working on smart charging infrastructure with more public charging stations and charging squares, plus fast chargers for logistics and taxis. We challenge businesses, homeowners and tenants to join in.

![img-75.jpeg](img-75.jpeg)

# What have we already done?

We keep expanding the public charging network. Rotterdam now has 5,400 public charging points. We also realised a number of smart bi-directional charging squares, fast chargers and a VvE counter, among other things.

# Which projects are still ongoing?

For 2025, our goals are:

4,000 additional charging points.
100 extra points for fast charging.
4 extra heavy duty loaders for trucks.
Advise 500 companies and prepare an area-based approach for all 45 business parks, with charging advice for each site.
Make plan for charging infrastructure mobile tools.

Funding comes partly from government funds National Agenda Charging Infrastructure (NAL) and partly from DTB. Funding is covered through 2024.

# What is left for us to do?

Rotterdam is well on its way, but to stay ahead, acceleration is needed. Central government is driving developments with the NAL and the municipality is also working together in a regional context to speed things up. The realisation of projects ultimately lies with the municipality.

These things need to happen:

Accelerate construction of sufficient charging infrastructure, add 4,000 charging points in 3 years and a new concession is needed by 2025.
Realise charging points for logistics in the ZES zone.

Encourage and help private parties (businesses in
and around ZES zone, housing associations, landlords and VvEx) to realise more charging points.

Devise solutions to electricity network tightness by, smart charging and, for example, using temporary storage of electricity to reduce peak loads on the grid.
Establish robust multi-year budget beyond 2024.

# Passenger transport

Developments around the electrification of buses, shared cars and taxis are moving fast. This is great, as it is better for the climate and produces a cleaner and quieter city.

Passenger transport on electricity comes through national agreements and tenders

Electric share cars
Public transport buses RET (national covenant and MRDH concession); Transport special target groups WMO (part of concession); Taxis (deal with Rotterdam taxi industry on electrification, in line with national covenant. To be included in taxi policy)

![img-76.jpeg](img-76.jpeg)

# What have we already done?

36% of shared cars are clean.
40% of RET buses are clean.
50% of target group transport is clean.

# Which projects are still ongoing?

Helth of passenger traffic in and around the city consists of commuting and other business mileage. That is why the municipality is investing heavily in the Employers' Climate Alliance Sustainable Mobility approach. More than 100 major Rotterdam employers have now joined, representing more than 140,000 employees. They are going for 50% CO2 reduction by travelling less, cycling more, walking, emission-free vehicles and attractive mobility packages for their employees.

# What is left for us to do?

We can only meet the targets if we scale up. Studies show where there are still gains to be made in passenger transport:

Expansion into a more results-oriented employer approach.
Mobility transition: smart thinking for all modes (bicycle, car, public transport, etc.) is needed to create a pleasant and accessible city stay.

# Freight transport and logistics

Goods transport is necessary, but also a burden on the city. In the inner city, Rotterdam will introduce a zero-emission zone for all business vans and trucks on 1 January 2025. This heeh the college established in 2020 in the ZES Covenant. The investment comes from state funds (SPUK) and the DTB. Funding is covered through 2024.

# What have we already done?

Together with the 72 partners from the ZES Covenant and the Logistiek010 community, Rotterdam is working on introducing the ZES zone. With customised advice and subsidy schemes, we ensure that the zone is feasible for all entrepreneurs, from sole traders to multinationals. So far, 18 new concepts have been realised, such as cargo bikes for entrepreneurs and construction hubs. In September, the draft decision for the ZES zone was published.

# Which projects are still ongoing?

To make the zero-emission zone work well, we pay attention to the following points:

Sufficient availability of electric vehicles; Traffic decision in early 2024 to establish the zone; Making space in the city
for logistics transhipment hubs;
Cleaning of municipal vans and trucks;

# What is left for us to do?

Studies indicate how we can reduce emissions further:

Regional cooperation to make logistics cleaner;
Cooperation with the Port Authority for (heavy) freight traffic around the city;
Extension of the ZES zone to the whole city by 2040.

# Other mobility

Several pilots were conducted in 2022 to gain experience and stimulate the market for the use of zero emission mobile tools.

In large framework contracts, among other things, firm efforts have been made to work with zero-emission equipment; in addition, a pilot was carried out in which large equipment was tested. It turns out that there is a lot of savings potential here for CO2 and pollutant emissions. An approach to changing mobile equipment (such as construction equipment) is being drawn up based on the pilots and a study of the possibilities of relief.

Inland navigation plays a major role in hinterland freight transport. Inland shipping consumes less energy per tonne-kilometre than road transport. On the other hand, CO2 and pollutant emissions from vessels have decreased only slightly in recent years. Road traffic heeh halved its emissions compared to 2005.

The municipality is working with the Port Authority on an approach to inland waterway cleaning. There are gains to be made there. In late 2023, a first draft of an inland shipping clean-up plan was presented. This plan will be further developed in 2024, which will include emission labels for inland navigation.

# Port of the future

Rotterdam's port is one of the world's largest ports and a key driver of the national economy. To maintain its position, it must develop into the sustainable world port of the future. This way, we also retain jobs for Rotterdammers. The port is working towards a 55% CO2 reduction by 2030 and zero emissions by 2050. By that year, the port industry will also have to be fully circular.

## 100% in the Port

The port of Rotterdam has grown since 1990 and this is reflected in CO2 figures. Due to the closure of coal-fired power plants, electrification and energy savings in industry, CO2 emissions decreased between 2016 and 2020. Since 2020, total emissions have remained about the same. No big decrease is expected for 2023 either. Mainly because coal plants have been allowed to run harder since the international energy crisis.

![img-78.jpeg](img-78.jpeg)
Totale CO2-uitstoot Haven (inclusief scheepvaart)

Achieving all the goals requires major commitment from the major companies in the port, innovations from newcomers, as well as retraining staff and investing in safety. The use of green power and hydrogen is decisive in making the energy system more sustainable. A circular ground and fuel system requires a mix of CO2, hydrogen, biomass and residual streams.

![img-79.jpeg](img-79.jpeg)

![img-80.jpeg](img-80.jpeg)

![img-81.jpeg](img-81.jpeg)

Investments by companies in the port show that they have confidence in the future. However, accelerating the transition in the port is complex, because in front of the companies and the municipality are many factors over which we have limited control. These include, for instance, nitrogen space, limited space in upstream and downstream areas or the tightness of the labour market.

It is important not to delay decisions on major infrastructure projects, such as the Delta Corridor or the construction of the national hydrogen network. For this, we need the central government and the province. To recruit technical staff, we work together with educational institutions, companies, Defalings and the Port Authority.

## The role of the municipality

In the port, the ball is in the court of the big companies and the state. In the port, the central government makes agreements on CO2 reduction with the big emitters. Together, the State and the municipality are shareholders in the Port Authority. Besides our limited official role, we do our best to bring companies together, promote innovation and improve preconditions, for instance through the Acceleration House.

# Making production system more sustainable

Robesdan can't+ industrial cluster includes five oil refineries, over 45 chemical companies and five vegetable oil refineries. The target for this industry is a biofuel- and hydrogen-based economy.

% reduction compared to 1900 means we need to reduce emissions to 5.5 Mton by 2023. From 2025 onwards, we must on the effects of planned and started projects in the part in the field of the options and storage and hydrogen. The Port Authority head subscales that projects for 12.7 Mton savings have been promised by companies. Many of these projects involve infrastructure. Since the infrastructure is in place, much more reduction is possible. But we are not there yet. In the annual DOAR reduction, there is a similar calculation of CO2 reduction, namely, how much of the potential CO2 reduction within Robesdan is assigned "certain". "expanded" or "targeted" status. As a result, they arrive at a lower reduction figure of 12.4 Mton/ea.

![img-82.jpeg](img-82.jpeg)

# What have we already done?

Retaining such large quantities must take place at the big companies and projects. The municipality jumps in when plans and parties need a push in the right direction. Our commitment here focuses on the following steps:

## Addressing businesses and helping with bothersome

It is the companies in the port that have to make the big difference. From the municipality, we address the companies on their social responsibility and we help the companies with bothersome they experience. The emphasis is on the labour market, education, permits and space.

## Breaking down barriers with the right parties

The municipality brings together parties around key issues that can remove barriers. Examples: Cluster Tasks Port &amp; Industry, the Acceleration House, and Permit Pilot and the coalitions around the use of captured coal (CO2) and offshore wind.

## Lobbying and international cooperation

To advance growing in the port, we also contribute in lobbying the state and the EU. We do this on specific topics together with other port cities in Europe, such as with Hamburg and Antwerp.

## Doubling observations

The municipality supports and funds innovates projects from the energy and sustainability transition budget and the Rotterdam Energy Transition Fund (ETF-R). This is how we try to accelerate developments around hydrogen, circular raw materials and shave power, for example.

## Which projects are still ongoing?

The planned, the latest projects (the observed CO2 reduction) still up to 12.4 Mton/ea. co-ordinators (excluding medicine shipping), according to DOARI calculations. This does not mean that all projects are guaranteed, certain parameters will have to be met in order to make the necessary investment decisions. Moreover, there is much more potential to reduce CO2, but it is also more essential. Therefore, we will continue to monitor progress.

## What is left for us to do?

Dozens of planned and started projects in the port area will run to the big reduction in CO2 reduction. But many conditions (money, space, technology) are not yet in place. From the sustainability transition budget, the municipality supports circular projects, hydrogen and gas to shave power. However, much more is needed to make it happen. That is why we continue to work to engage companies, help remove barriers, lobby and encourage innovation.

# Making the energy system more sustainable

By 2030, the two coal-fired power plants on the Maasvlakte must close. There are already many wind turbines in the port, and where opportunities arise we would like to see this number grow further. Many power cables from offshore wind farms come ashore in the port.

And this college wants to realise 3.2 km² of solar panels in city and port. We are looking for additional opportunities to generate wind energy in the port area. For the gas power plants, we are investigating whether they can also run on sustainable gases, such as hydrogen.

The amount of renewable energy available in the Netherlands is not enough to meet our own energy needs. Therefore, we will probably also have to import renewable energy, just as we currently do with fossil fuels. Hydrogen, produced using solar and wind energy in other countries, seems to be a promising energy carrier. We hope to welcome the first hydrogen tankers to Rotterdam in 2026. To make all these developments possible, the energy system in the port is undergoing a major overhaul. The use of other energy sources makes other demands on storage and infrastructure. For instance, the electricity grid in Botlek and Europoort has reached its limit. New connections are no longer possible.

Network operators, the state and the province are in charge of solving this problem.

# What have we already done?

Energy infrastructure is key to a successful energy transition in the port. Plans for this are laid down in the Cluster Energy Strategy (CES) Rotterdam-Moerdijk. The central government is taking the lead in its realisation through the Multiannual Energy and Climate Investment Programme (MIEK). Of the 14 MIEK projects in the Netherlands, nine are located on Rotterdam territory.

# Which projects are still ongoing?

As a municipality, we support the MIEK projects. We also facilitate bringing power cables ashore from offshore wind farms. We also make arrangements to generate solar and wind energy in the port area.

# What is left for us to do?

All plans together lead to the desired reduction of CO2 emissions, but we still need to arrange the optimal framework conditions for their realisation. In particular, nitrogen space, spatial factors and tailor-made subsidies from the state are of great importance.

# Making transport system more sustainable

For the port's competitive position, a reliable network of road, rail, waterways and pipelines is crucial. To make logistics chains more sustainable, the port focuses on sustainable fuels, electrification, efficiency and encouraging the shift to the most efficient forms of transport (modal shift). For shipping, we mainly focus on shore power. Shore power provides docked vessels with electricity, allowing them to turn off their polluting generators. It is currently the best available technology to reduce shipping emissions. It reduces noise, CO2, nitrogen and particulate emissions. This is important as city and port grow ever closer together.

![img-85.jpeg](img-85.jpeg)

![img-86.jpeg](img-86.jpeg)

![img-87.jpeg](img-87.jpeg)

# What have we already done?

Shore power for inland vessels is already available throughout Rotterdam. The shore power strategy of the municipality and the Port Authority has triggered the development of shore power for seagoing vessels. With a subsidy from the municipality, shore-based power for Heerema's off-shore vessels has been installed in the Calandkanaal. In 2023, new shore power facilities in Menee-Vierhavens and in the Waalhaven were commissioned. Besides shore power, projects are also being carried out for alternative fuels and for more efficient transport, for example through automation.

# Which projects are still ongoing?

In the Port of Rotterdam, shore power is being realised at Lloydkade, Parkkade and Wilhelminskade (Cruise Terminal). As a municipality, we started a scheme in 2023 in which we finance 80% of a feasibility study. With other ports (Hamburg, Antwerp), we coordinate our actions around shore power so that we strengthen and help each other in this area. Also towards the EU. We also work together with surrounding municipalities.

# What is left for us to do?

This college wants to step up its existing ambitions. The municipality is working hard to equip all container terminals with quayside electricity as early as 2026. For container ships, ferries and cruise ships, quayside electricity will be mandatory in Europe from 2030. EU and national subsidies are available for its realisation. We are working together with the Port Authority, the companies and Stedin to also realise shore power for all other ships (including bulk ships and offshore).

|  Built environment | Natural gas free | Ongoing | Schiebroek & 110-morgen Aardgasvrij | With a large, coherent package, the Netherlands wants to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 49% by 2030. The Netherlands must be natural gas-free by 2050. In 2021, 50,000 buildings per year must be taken off natural gas. Well before 2030, this number should even grow to 200,000 homes per year. In the districts of Schiebroek Zuid, Schiebroek Noord and 110-Morgen, initiator Enertrans is in the process of applying for permits and subsidies to connect these neighborhoods to a residual heat network together with housing corporations. These two districts are listed in the Rotterdam TVW as promising for starting an area approach before 2025. | The objective is to take the market initiative further. The aim of the market initiative is to connect the entire area of Schiebroek south, Schiebroek north and 110 morgen. The ambition of the heat party is to further expand the heat network in the area and to realize a geothermal source. | The future effects have been estimated by the DCMR**  |
|  Built environment | Natural gas free | Ongoing | Agniessebuurt-Oost | Area approach natural gas-free | 619 homes of Havensteder are expected to be natural gas-free by 2030 and 269 homes of private owners are intended to be natural gas-free by 2030. | The future effects have been estimated by the DCMR**  |

|  Built environment | Natural gas free | Ongoing | Reyeroord-Oost aardgasvrij | In order to connect existing buildings to the heat network, an area-specific approach is needed that offers everyone an alternative to natural gas and keeps the social costs of the energy transition as low as possible. In the analysis, Reyeroord emerged as a suitable district for the roll-out of a heat network. This is because the heat network already runs through the area, the housing corporation in Reyeroord will also connect its property, there is a wide variety of buildings and the street in the district already has to be opened for a large part for a sewer replacement. Social marketing was used to map out the wishes of residents, their needs and ideas and how best to approach people for topics such as making the home more sustainable and connecting the home to the heat network. | With natural gas-free Reyeroord, we aim to achieve the following goals: That Reyeroord will be natural gas-free by 2035: That all homeowners will have had the opportunity to connect to district heating, the natural gas alternative that the municipality supports, by 2030: That this switch to district heating is affordable for homeowners in Reyeroord, and that they are satisfied with the municipality's approach. That homeowners can make a well-informed decision on how to natural gas-free. That linkage opportunities are identified and, where possible, capitalized on.-1197 homes of private owners are intended to be natural gas-free by 2030. | The future effects have been estimated by the DCMR**  |

|  Built environment | Energy saving | Done | Efficiente en intelligente straatverlichting | Public lighting in Rotterdam consists of 106,900 luminaires (lamps). This lighting consumes 22.7 million kWh on an annual basis. This corresponds to the average electricity consumption of more than 9,100 households. Already, 6 million kWh of electricity is saved annually (the electricity consumption of more than 2,400 households). If all public lighting is converted to LED, including a dimming regime, energy will be saved by approximately 30% compared to current consumption. | RUGGEDISED project R11. Replaced street lighting fixtures throughout R'dam with LED incl remote monitoring sensors. By June 2022, some 60,000 luminaires have now been replaced, saving 6 million kWh of electricity per year, which is equivalent to the electricity consumption of more than 2,400 households. The task for the next 3 years is to have replaced all 100,000 luminaires. An acceleration has been initiated because otherwise this operation would take another 25 to 30 years. The plan is that 15,000 luminaires will be replaced annually. | The effects have been calculated by the DCMR*  |
|  Built environment | Energy saving | Done | Isolatiesubsidie kleine VvE's | VvEs (with a maximum of 7 apartments) could apply for a subsidy for insulating their building. A VvE had to have at least one part of the building insulated, such as the roof, the façade or the ground floors. | VvEs, with a maximum of 7 apartments, can apply for this subsidy for insulating their building. A VvE only needs to have one part of the building insulated. Think of the roof, the ground floors, a façade or windows. We set requirements for the insulation value, the environmental quality of the insulation materials and there are some additional requirements for a healthy indoor environment. The VvE receives the subsidy in advance of taking the measures. The subsidy amounts to a maximum of € 1,500 per apartment and a maximum of € 10,000 per small VvE, up to a maximum of 50% of the costs. In total, there is € 450,000 in the subsidy pot | The effects have been calculated by the DCMR*  |
|  Built environment | Energy saving | Done | Verduurzamingspakketten | With this project, we set up a process of unburdening in which Rotterdammers were helped with insulation plans from the initial idea to implementation. | Project is closed. 136 homes reached; 163 measures implemented. This is without solar panels (33 homes). | The effects have been calculated by the DCMR*  |

Integral part of the sustainability program for VvEs. | The effects have been calculated by the DCMR*  |
|  Built environment | Energy saving | Done | Participatie platform (Klimaatdeal #14) | The aim of the consultation platform is to stimulate the implementation of initiatives in the field of sustainability, clean energy, circularity and employment, for example. This will make these initiatives more promising and the energy transition will be accelerated and scaled up. | The climate deal has been successfully completed. Discussions were held with these parties about how they could be involved in the implementation of climate policy. As a result, a VvE platform has emerged. | The effects have been calculated by the DCMR*  |
|  Built environment | Energy saving | Done | Isolatiesubsidie grote VvEs Pendrecht aanvragen | Large Owners' Associations (VvEs) in Pendrecht with at least 8 apartments can receive a subsidy if, in addition to maintenance work, they accelerate at least 1 insulation measure. This makes this scheme easily accessible for owners in a VvE with less capital. The insulation subsidy can be applied for from 1 January 2020 to 31 October 2023, or until the budget runs out. The effect of the scheme is that by increasing the quality of construction and living, all residents in the building not only experience more living pleasure and comfort, but ultimately also consume less natural gas, receive a lower energy bill and emit less CO2. | Large Owners' Associations (VvEs) in Pendrecht with at least 8 apartments can receive a subsidy if, in addition to maintenance work, they accelerate at least 1 insulation measure.

|  Built environment | Energy saving | Done | Save the Homes | In order to make more private homes more sustainable, work is being done on the development of a citizen hub (an integrated housing renovation service) at district level. The aim of the project is to facilitate homeowners to determine a working method based on practical experience. | In Hoogvliet, the objective was to achieve 30 homes with a total of 91 measures: a total of 29.5 tonnes of CO2 reduction. This is an average of 21% Energy savings (incl. production). There are several results to report in Prins-Alexander. In 2022-2023, a guidance process was started for 16 comparable homes on the same street. In the lead is energy cooperative Alex Energie. A handyman team / construction collective has been set up especially for this project. Out of the 16 homes, 9 have gone through a very collective, deep renovation process. 6 of the 9 homes have become natural gas-free. 193 solar panels have been installed on the roofs of the 9 homes. | Impact is < 0.1 kton. See DCMR report for details**  |
|  Built environment | Energy saving | Initiative | GAI koopwoningen | This project contributes to Main Objective 2 Energy transition in the built environment/ 1. Energy saving and making the housing stock more sustainable. We are going to help owners through area-specific approaches to insulation. In 2023, we will start with three approaches. We want to reach about 4,000 homes with growth to 16,000 by 2030, if there is also money for that. Focus on areas that meet the following requirements: relatively many poor energy labels (E, F and G), relatively low WOZ value. We make owners an offer to insulate per area. This ensures that homes are prepared for medium-temperature or sometimes low-temperature heat solutions (for natural gas-free), consume less energy and that residents get a better grip on their energy bills. Part of future-proof living. | 4000 homes an insulation measure. 2000 in three area-specific/collective insulation approaches and 2000 in the insulation approaches in the natural gas-free areas. Start in 2023 with a term of 4 years. The amount of savings depends on the type and number of insulation measures per home. | 0,6 kton**  |
|  Built environment | Energy saving | Initiative | Energieloket 2.0 | Every municipality is expected to have an Energy Desk. Contract with last Energy Desk has expired. That is why we have to select a new counter by means of a tender. |  | The future effects are still being assessed by the DCMR***  |
|  Built environment | Energy saving | Ongoing | 0% lening verduurzamen VvEs | A 0% interest loan for VvEs. In the focus districts urban renewal, so that when tackling the sustainability of the private housing stock, owners in VvEs also choose to take sustainability measures. | 65 loans (500 homes) | The future effects have been estimated by the DCMR**  |
|  Built environment | Energy saving | Ongoing | Leenfonds verduurzaming en verbeteren van panden/woningen ETF-G | The energy transition loan fund is a financing instrument of the municipality. From 2021, the energy transition loans intended for building sustainability and improvement will be available. Private individuals, homeowners, VvEs, small businesses and social organizations can apply for a loan. | The aim is to lower the financing threshold for property owners, because residents, VvEs (large and small) and small businesses, among others, have the opportunity to borrow money at a relatively low interest rate for the sustainable maintenance of their property. | The future effects have been estimated by the DCMR**  |
|  Built environment | Energy saving | Ongoing | Verduurzaming VvE | VvEs are guided in drawing up a sustainable Long-Term Maintenance Plan (DM3OP), including the necessary decision-making within the VvE, market request and financing. | 50 VvEs (30 large and 8 or more apartments) and 20 small (7 or fewer apartments) participate in a sustainability advice and support process (= 1,000 apartments) per year. Expected result: 20-40% reduction in energy demand. Implementation has started. The guidance for large VvEs has 2 phases. PHASE I: QUICKSCANPHASE II: ORIENTATION PHASE For the 58 HOAs that started the advisory process from 2022 onwards, 14 HOAs have now completed both phases.

|  Built environment | Energy poverty | Done | Energievouchers voor huurders | The project focused on tenants and offered energy saving packages and energy saving advice to households. Little attention is paid to this group in existing national and local schemes. In addition to awareness, the aim is to ensure that tenants apply small energy-saving measures (LED lamps, radiator foil, etc.) or energy-saving advice and are more aware of their energy consumption. | This budget was spent on reaching 2,222 tenants with an energy-saving package (such as LED lamps, draught strips and radiator foil). Or an energy saving advice worth 90 euros. The budget has been used as a supplement to the budget from the central government through the Energy Use Reduction Scheme; since it was only aimed at homeowners. The vast majority of tenants opted for energy-saving products. They were able to place an order themselves via a webshop and/or were approached by local organizations (including the Energy Bank and language/environmental coaches Stichting Pauw in the Bospolder-Tussendijken district) that are committed to energy savings in combination with combating energy poverty. | The effects have been calculated by the DCMR*  |

Through a combination of our own investments, subsidy (for heating and cooking) and loans, we want to keep the costs manageable for the people of Rotterdam. Residents are most apprehensive about switching to electric cooking. Many residents have little financial space (60% of homeowners in Pendrecht have a low income). With this pilot, we unburden and offer subsidies to residents in neighborhoods where there is an ambition to become natural gas-free. | 910 households to make the switch to electric cooking. | The future effects have been estimated by the DCMR**  |
|  Built environment | Energy poverty | Ongoing | Energieklusser+ | Due to the increased energy prices, a group of Rotterdammers is struggling with Energy Poverty. They are finding it increasingly difficult to pay their energy bills, and are not always able to make their homes more sustainable in order to reduce energy consumption. The target group consists of tenants and homeowners. One way to reduce Energy Poverty is through the use of Energieklussers. The Energy Fixer immediately applies energy-saving measures to residents' homes and gives behavioral tips to reduce energy bills. Implementing small energy-saving measures is for Rotterdammers with an income of up to 200% WSM. For homeowners, expand the measures with medium-sized energy-saving measures such as installing bottom foil, replacing the ventilation box and hydronic balancing. | Implementing small energy-saving measures for Rotterdammers with an income of up to 200% of the social minimum income.

|  Built environment | New buildings | Ongoing | Gemeentelijk vastgoed | The municipality uses many buildings. Replacing or renovating these buildings in the right way contributes greatly to making municipal real estate more sustainable. | We have two goals for making our real estate more sustainable: By 2030, we want to reduce CO2 emissions by 55%. To this end, we are going to replace or renovate 250 municipal real estate buildings to extend their lifespan. Buildings with a poor energy label are particularly affected. But beware, these new and renovated buildings are not yet energy-neutral. We want to achieve that, by 2050. In 2050 we want to achieve a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions. This is not possible at the moment because we currently only have enough money for normal maintenance, renovation and new construction that complies with current laws and regulations, with a small focus on sustainability (e.g. BREEAM Good or GPR 7.5). | 10,4 kton**  |
|  Built environment | New buildings | Ongoing | Nieuwbouw duurzame gebiedontwikkeling | With the Sustainable Area Development programme, we help planning teams and developers to make Rotterdam's sustainability ambitions concrete and include them in their projects. We do this by providing integrated sustainability advice for projects, developing tools and sharing knowledge. | The Sustainable Area Development programme has process objectives, not concrete numbers for homes, for example. This is because we are not directly responsible for these projects. Our goal is: sustainability is integrally included in all area developments from the start. | The future effects have been estimated by the DCMR**  |

|  Business | Businesses | Done | Programma versnellen Innovatie Rotterdam MKB | MKB01ONXT: The broad SME sector is the mainstay of Rotterdam's economy and employment. In addition to frontrunners, SMEs also have a large 'peloton' that finds it more difficult to keep up with the high pace of innovation and has difficulty shaping necessary innovations. This while there are great opportunities for sustainability and digitization. The Accelerating Innovation Rotterdam SME programme focuses on increasing awareness (information and inspiration), overview (knowledge, financing) and action perspective for SMEs at large. We are developing the programme with partners such as MKB Rotterdam-Rijnmond, VNO-NCW Rotterdam, Chamber of Commerce, Rabobank, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy and educational institutions. The program focuses only on those things that are beyond the reach of SMEs themselves. With this, we want to encourage SMEs to start the transition to more circular, sustainable and digital business operations. | This is a program part of the Economics department. Various things have been realized. For example, in 2019, 150 SMEs were present at the SME Day 'your waste is worth gold'. Furthermore, the project 'frontrunners circular restaurants' has recently been launched, the CIRCO project is running tracks in which SMEs get started with a circular design of their service or product, digital and circular goodie bags are available via ondernemen010, and a communication campaign is being developed.

Investing in innovative entrepreneurship that develops in the city is at least as important. So that new solutions, for example in the field of sustainability, also come from our city. From an economic perspective, we do this in different ways. | By focusing on four programmes and activities, investments are made in Rotterdam's innovation climate in a broad sense. In doing so, we create conditions that increase the opportunities for companies to come up with new solutions for CO2 reduction. By driving innovative entrepreneurship, innovation in various sectors gets going. It is necessary to focus and scale up innovations within SMEs so that they are applicable and effective on a larger scale. It contributes to the broad support among entrepreneurs in the city and helps the smaller companies in the city further in their growth.

|   |  | Ongoing | verduurzamen werklocaties (bedrijventerreinen) | In recent years, corona and the energy crisis have taken a big toll on small and medium-sized businesses. Lake Entrepreneurs are becoming more aware of future-proof entrepreneurship. It is becoming increasingly important that you make your company more sustainable, also because government agencies already have a policy for this or are busy making rules for this. Offices must have at least energy label C by 2023 and from 2025 the Inner city prohibited for vans and trucks that run on fossil fuels (diesel or petrol). Since 2040, this ban will apply everywhere. Entrepreneurs who are large consumers of energy must comply with the obligation to provide information according to the Environmental Management Act. It is only a matter of time before there will be more laws and regulations for all entrepreneurs. With the Sustainable Work Locations approach, the entrepreneur is helped with energy savings, energy (solar panels) and with making his building and the business park more sustainable. He is relieved of the burden of applying for subsidies, receives information about his building and installations and is relieved of the burden of taking energy-saving measures. In doing so, this programme contributes to a sustainable economy with future-proof work locations and makes entrepreneurs in the city resilient and ready for the future. | CO2 reduction at work locations (business parks, offices, catering and retail) | The future effects have been estimated by the DCMR**  |

There are many shipyards in the region active with production, maintenance and refits (conversions) for various types of ships. These shipyards work closely with all kinds of (technical) suppliers who are highly regarded (worldwide) in the field of quality and innovation. The maritime manufacturing industry is facing a major sustainability challenge. This involves reducing emissions and waste in production chains, as well as designing and building sustainable ships for the entire life cycle. In response to the major sustainability challenge, the Circolab was set up to meet the needs of companies at chain level by working together with knowledge institutions, companies and governments and actually getting solutions implemented from the drawing board. | To help as many maritime manufacturing companies as possible to devise and implement practical solutions at chain level to make the manufacturing industry (in particular a focus on refit, because it is a growth market) circular, sustainable and future-proof.

|  Circularity | Ongoing | Programma Rotterdam Circular | Rotterdam Circular is working on the development of an economy in which Rotterdam uses raw materials and materials throughout the chain as efficiently as possible. A large part of the CO2 emissions in Rotterdam are caused by the use of raw materials and materials. A circular economy therefore makes an important contribution to CO2 reduction. Through the programme, we are working on less, better, longer and reuse of materials and raw materials. This contributes to a greener and more sustainable Rotterdam. And of a city that is healthier, cleaner and more economically resilient. We are working on 3 chains: Construction, Organic Flows and Consumer Goods and with 3 user groups: Municipal commissioning and purchasing, Entrepreneurs and Rotterdammers. We expect to make the most impact within these agendas. | The raw materials transition is not an end in itself. It is a means to restore the balance between people, the environment and the economy. A circular economic system contributes to three overarching goals: 1) A greener and more sustainable Rotterdam, 2) A more economically resilient Rotterdam, 3) A healthier and cleaner Rotterdam. By 2030, the municipality wants the use of minerals, metals and fossil raw materials to be 50% less.

|  Energy system | Solar | Ongoing | Zonnig Pendrecht | The immediate reason for this project plan is a subsidy obtained from the Ministry of the Interior for the realization of solar roofs through the concept of a social postcode rose. A social postcode rose means that residents of Pendrecht can receive a share in the solar roof provided they provide a social quid pro quo. From the area approach - Aardagsvrij Pendrecht, this project is known under the name: 'Sunny Pendrecht'. Recently, we have been working on a new variant of this project in which we have adapted the original project in design and scale. This new set-up/approach of Sunny Pendrecht fits in well with the program: 'Opportunities for West' and thus a claim is made for subsidy funds from the program: 'Opportunities for West'. | With the Sunny Pendrecht project, we want to tackle energy poverty by giving residents the opportunity to permanently reduce their energy bills with a small investment. This project focuses on residents of apartments in Pendrecht that are part of a VvE, both tenants and owner-occupiers. The municipality aims to generate a capacity of 750 Megawatts by 2030. Sunny Pendrecht translates this into the number of solar panels and the number of households that are helped in Pendrecht. In Pendrecht, 23 VvEs with a total of 17,500 m2 of roof area are eligible. Our goal is to reach 3 VvEs with this pilot and to install at least 300 solar panels, which will help at least 35 households. | The future effects have been estimated by the DCMR**  |

Because the current concession expires in 2025, we are preparing a new tender to be able to install additional public charging stations after 2025. The number of electric mobile equipment and shared cars is also increasing, and with it the charging demand. In order to anticipate this in a targeted manner, we are drawing up a plan of action for charging infrastructure for mobile equipment and shared mobility. | This is what we are going to achieve: • 2,000 extra charging stations• 100 fast charging points | 22 kton**  |
|  Mobility | Charging infra | Ongoing | Reststroom onderzoek RET | Research into and application for a permit to use residual power from the metro for charging electric vehicles. In this way, we avoid unnecessary burden on the Rotterdam power grid.

|  Mobility | Charging infra | Ongoing | Laadvoorzieningen gemeentelijke terreinen | All municipal vehicles, which will become electric, must be able to charge. To this end, we are installing charging stations and fast chargers on municipal grounds. In a number of cases, the power connections need to be expanded. | The number of charging points follows the demand from the change of the own fleet | Impact is < 0.1 kton. See DCMR report for details**  |
|  Mobility | Freight transport | Done | Stimuleren slimme bouwlogistiek | With the construction logistics incentive scheme, we encourage more efficient, more systematic and (if possible) emission-free (without harmful emissions) construction logistics, in which builders make fewer trips through the city to supply Rotterdam's construction sites. | Construction loads in the city are down by 19%. | The effects have been calculated by the DCMR*  |
|  Mobility | Freight transport | Done | Bundeling ophalen bedrijfsafval (Klimaatdeal #24) | A "white label" collection system is being developed, within which emission-free vehicles can be used profitably for the collection of industrial waste. The aim is to make more sustainable use of vehicles that collect industrial waste and to reduce the number of transport movements. This climate deal coincides with the climate deal Emission-free supply of building materials (Climate Deal #23). This means that this climate deal was successfully completed in 2021. Further initiatives in the field of sustainable logistics are being implemented through Logistiek 010. | See project "emission-free supply of building materials". | The effects have been calculated by the DCMR*  |
|  Mobility | Freight transport | Done | Emissievrije belevering van bouwmaterialen (Klimaatdeal #23) | Transporting building materials such as concrete paving stones requires heavy vehicles, for which there were no emission-free models on the market yet. A supplier of building materials, together with its transporter, has taken the initiative to purchase an emission-free (+ without emission of harmful substances) trailer with tractor, for the supply of building materials for the municipality of Rotterdam. The aim is to set an example to initiate the desired transition to emission-free inner-city transport in this segment as well. This pilot has become feasible partly due to the support of the national government and the municipality. The emission-free delivery has successfully started and this climate deal has been completed. | Pilot emission-free delivery of building materials. | The effects have been calculated by the DCMR*  |
|  Mobility | Freight transport | Ongoing | Verduurzaming gemeentelijk wagenpark | The municipal vehicle fleet must be sustainable by the end of 2030 (replacement of fossil fuel vehicles with emission-free ones). This is necessary for the climate and air quality and to be able to continue to carry out municipal activities, such as waste collection, in the ZE zone for City Logistics. By making its own fleet more sustainable, the municipality of Rotterdam is also setting a good example and stimulating the market for electric driving. Knowledge sharing is of great importance here. | The objective is:- Passenger cars 100% emission-free by 2023.- Light commercial vehicles 100% emission-free by 2025.- Heavy-duty vehicles 100% emission-free by 2030.- Machines and tools 100% emission-free by 2030. | The total impact of making the municipal vehicle fleet more sustainable is 3 kton.  |

|  Mobility | Passenger transport | Done | Experiment schoolomgevingen (Klimaatdeal #26) | Two schools in Rotterdam will have a safer traffic environment for a period of approximately four months. The aim is that children who previously did not participate in traffic independently by bicycle will now do so. A positive side effect is that less car traffic in the school environment and lower speeds benefit the quality of life in the vicinity of these schools. Two schools have been given concrete follow-up as part of the deal: The Theresia School and the Bergse Zonnebloem. Both experiments have now been completed. The school environment approach will be continued as part of municipal policy. The neighbourhood hubs of Fietscampus 010 are the base for cycling mobility activities in the neighbourhood. From there, networking, theme, information and workshop meetings are provided. As a result, a Bicycle Campus offers a suitable answer to emerging mobility questions and needs for each neighbourhood.

|   |   |   |   |  This climate deal ended in 2021. In addition to negative consequences due to COVID-19, practical impossibilities for the provider – offering an adjusted rate to the target group – also proved to be an obstacle. It was evaluated and decided to include the lessons learned in scaling up to City-wide shared mobility (Climate Deal in development #56).  |   |   |
|  Mobility | Passenger transport | Done | Zakelijke deelmobiliteit (Klimaatdeal #29) | The electric shaved car is a good alternative to a private car or the lease, rental or pool car due to its mobility guarantee. We are therefore setting up a hub with electric shaved cars for the business market. Because the car-sharing system is demand-driven, raw materials and valuable space are used efficiently. | A hub for business shared mobility | The effects have been calculated by the DCMR*  |

With the Rotterdam Climate Citizens' Council, we hope to stimulate and collect them. The 2022 Omnibus Survey shows that 7 out of 10 Rotterdammers are concerned about the climate. The climate affects everyone. That is why it is important to involve Rotterdammers more in devising and deciding on actions to achieve the climate goals. The Rotterdam Climate Action Plan (KAR) shows that more plans are needed on top of what the municipality is already doing. After all, the municipality cannot do it alone: it also requires commitment from residents, organizations and companies in Rotterdam. In the coalition agreement 'One City' has been agreed to organize a citizens' assembly on the theme of climate. | The objective of the Rotterdam Climate Citizens' Assembly is to collect proposals that lead to achieving the Rotterdam climate goals and to gain experience with a citizens' assembly. We want to continue to build on the municipality's involvement with the people of Rotterdam and vice versa.

# 1) Introduction

When the mission was announced in 2021 it was a clear fit with Rotterdam. We had already been taking the steps advocated by this mission prior to the launch, in terms of understanding the system, building a mandate, shaping the right policies and actions, increasing our capacity to (imp)act and learn, evaluating and reassessing our course. Since the Rotterdam Climate Agreement (RKA, 2019) and our first and forecasting, assessing the impact of our climate actions, we have been going through many phases of learning, evaluating, and adapting our approach with the city council and our stakeholders, which we see as one of the key elements of this mission. This commitments section of the City Climate Contract (CCC) will show how we progressed so far and the ways we, the municipality and stakeholders, are working together on our climate actions

In this introduction we will show how we progressed since the RKA with our stakeholders, developing and implementing climate actions and other forms of engagement with stakeholders and our citizens. In the second part, we will elaborate on our setting of goals and the transitional phase we are in. Therefore, in the third part on strategic priorities, we will give an overview of our current priorities and the collaboration with stakeholders on the necessary actions, so to address in the fourth part the way forward. We conclude in the fourth part with the commitment on behalf of the Municipality of Rotterdam by Vice-mayor Chantal Zeegers, and an overview of all our agreements and collaborations on climate actions with our stakeholders which will be featured in annex 1.

In essence, our climate policy has slowly been shifting, from what can be done within the existing context to have the biggest CO2-reduction on the short and intermediate term, towards what in the end is needed to become a climate neutral city. This first of all, means practically, that no matter how big or how small the emissions are, for every person or business a viable pathway must be created towards a climate neutral city. This demands a progressive stakeholder engagement, in which more-and-more groups are involved in setting out climate actions.

But secondly, it leads to the necessity of more structural changes of which we are beginning to experience the signs. As our experience has taught us, an element is needed to be successful: a stronger multi-level governance and cooperation between the various state actors which shape our context for climate action. While targeting our current goal of -55% CO2-reduction in 2030 with our local climate actions, the success of them has been largely influenced (positively and negatively) by the way we work together. The mission is a chance to enhance the cooperation to successfully implement and scale-up our climate actions to accelerate the transition towards a climate neutral city.

Woking towards a climate neutral city asks for more than just reducing our emissions. It's about chancing the ways we live, work and leisure in our city. It requires a more integral and holistic approach and policies, where climate neutrality is part of a bigger endeavour, socially and economically, which is especially the case for the city of Rotterdam with the largest port of Europe. Alignment on time between the different policies and judicial and financial means is key to have the desired impact as well as ensure it is done on a just and inclusive way.

So, the mission is chance for all of us to deliver towards that goal. We express our hope we can mutually learn during this collaboration between Cities, the European Commission and our national government how to support local climate action more effectively and efficiently, because we are not on track yet to deliver on the goal set out in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1,5 C degrees.

faster digital way is from our point of view a precondition to ensure faster and more joint decision-making processes, ensuring we have a common understanding of the structural barriers to address which prevent us from accelerating towards zero. We with are stakeholders are determined to play our part. Rotterdam makes it happen!

# The Rotterdam Climate Agreement

Since we set our first target of -49% CO2-reduction for 2030 in 2019, and drafted the first plans to achieve it, the focus for Rotterdam has been on getting the desired results and push further along the way. This couldn't and cannot be done without the involvement of our local stakeholders. Therefore we established our first Rotterdam Climate Agreement (RKA) in 2019 were local stakeholders endorsed the overall climate goals and agreed upon 49 climate deals to reach those goals. An important part was also to agree upon how to implement the tasks set out in the National Climate agreement (2019).

More than 50 meetings were held with the participation of more than 100 companies and organisations and over 1000 citizens. The 'climate deals' touched on a variety of issues, big and small, not limited to CO2-reductor but also on for example consumption/circularity and the labour market. So called 'Climate tables' were established for the various emission domains to monitor progress and inspire new actions. Part of the RKA was also the first forecast of our common actions towards the 2030 goal, which has been repeated annually since then.

The experiences and outcome showed first of all it's not an easy tasks on a local level to decide on our own on actions with the big impact on CO2-emmissions that is needed. Dependency on national and/or European policies for locally to be successful, was evident. Second, that it's all part of a movement in which we depend on the willing and able but there are large differences in the degree of organisation. So, while professional stakeholders could agree on impactful climate deals, many other were less impactful and just a start for further up-scaling.

The Rotterdam Climate Agreement (2019)

To address this, the need arose to develop more sector/stakeholder-specific agreements and governance structures depended on the tasks ahead and the degree of organisation. For example, the Zero Emissions Logistics Roadmap (2020) which facilitated and helped businesses to prepare for this year installed zero emission zone for the inner-city of Rotterdam. Or the performance agreements (bi-annually updated) with social housing compagnies (which own more than 40% of all the residential buildings), on concrete number of buildings to insulate and made natural-gas-free.

We also set-up specific support and governance structures to help stakeholders to professionalise, like a platform for energy communities and house-owners-associations. So in this way we could expand the networks of different stakeholders so to let more people engage in local climate action.

# Targeting new stakeholders

Based on the experiences since the RKA, in 2022 we therefore decided to change the governance of the Rotterdam Climate Agreement with its five 'Climate tables'. While collaborating with many stakeholders on climate action, had become more institutionalised and part of the going concern, we focussed on addressing new target groups and networks so to ever expand our coverage among the city.

We first started with installing so-called 'Climate Boosters' (Klimaataanjagers): local persons with a broad private network, who's task is to build upon the networks established since the RKA, focussing on those areas were we perceived a gap and chances for strengthening stakeholder collaboration. An example are the activities of the Climate Booster on health care, which translates the Green Deal Sustainable Healthcare 3.0. (2022) in a local action plan for Rotterdam, addressing issues around energy, circularity and mobility. Worth mentioning is the research started on health care improvement in relation to CO2-reduction.

A second endeavour was setting up a citizens Council on Climate. It consisted of approximately 100 different Rotterdam residents. Young and old, from all kinds of neighbourhoods and with different backgrounds. The citizens' council met in six meetings last year to gain knowledge about the climate and to jointly devise solutions for a greener and healthier city. For example, should the heat and flooding in our neighbourhoods be reduced? Or do we want more green and energy savings? The members contribute from their own experience as a resident of Rotterdam. The citizens' council could call on experts and requests for information. Its advices have been adopted by the city council and preparations are underway to be implemented.

# Learning together

Because of the speed the transition is or must take place, common sense-making and sharing experiences is an import part to foster swift and effective collaboration. One of the many ways we try to contribute towards this goal is organising congresses on a regular basis.

Since 2020, a congress called ‘Recharge Earth’ is organised by our local congress location AHOY (which itself has 5.200 solar-PV’s and a thermal grid, realises as part of the EU-funded project Ruggedized), where hundreds of professional and semi-professionals take part in workshops and plenary debates. They recently signed a collaboration with Euroforum to expand their networks and expertise.

Recharge Earth: Renew, Reuse, Rethink.

Another important local event is the Citymakers congress (Stadsmakerscongres). Starting out as an event wanting to transcend the different sectoral policies, focussing on the people who make this city (developers, architects, policy makers, local heroes, etc), this has been increasingly taking aim at what it is to be a climate neutral city.

# 2) Goal: A Climate Neutral City

In 2019 our City Council officially adopted the goal of reaching climate neutrality in 2050 and reducing the emissions within its boundaries in 2030 by 49%. This was agreed upon with the Council Agreement on Energy Transition (Raadsakkoord Energietransitie, 2019). It identified 5 'transition pathways' to succeed in towards climate neutrality: Port &amp; Industry, Built Environment, Mobility, Energy-production, and the Economic transition. The last one is of utmost important for the city and our region, because it not only offers a chance for new economic growth and work, but also is essential to fill in the gap of current economic activities (especially Port &amp; Industry) which relies heavy on fossil fuels and plans to develop towards a circular and hydrogen hub for Europe.

We established our first Rotterdam Climate Agreement (RKA) in 2019. Local stakeholders endorsed the overall climate goal of then -49% CO2-reduction in 2030 and agreed upon 49 climate deals to reach those goals. Regarding climate neutrality there has been one target set for mobility for 2040 and for the city as a whole in 2050. More than 50 meetings were held with the participation of more than 100 compagnies and organisations and over 1000 citizens.

In 2022 we assessed that a more ambitious goal of -55% CO2-reduction for the whole city in 2030 was feasible, but also added a specific goal for the urban area (mobility and build environment) of minus 25% in 2026 (scope 1+2). Currently we have not (yet) set a 2030 intermediate goal for the urban areas of the city. The reasons for this are:

a) the preparation of the incoming administration in 2026: many of the current policies and associated action plans are set to contribute towards a target set for 2030, while some even stop in 2026. Consequently, policies targeting the emissions beyond, for a big part are in the middle in the process of being updated, which are essential in complementing our portfolio of actions for the periods beyond. Also, barriers on the short term (grid congestion, new law on health market) also forces us to reevaluate and update certain policies.

b) the preparation of new national measures by the national government to (still) reach the national goal in 2030, as well establishing a goal for 2035 as obligated to do by the national Climate Law, which are important to decide what to do additional.

c) the negotiations on the proposed EU target of -90% in 2040, of which we assess is to be very important for new European measures which impact our work and therefore actions.

To prepare, it's in our situation of utmost importance we can take these multilevel developments into consideration when we strategies what is wise. This version of the CCC thus is a starting point of preparation for the new administration, giving them the opportunity to establish an ambitious but feasible target with the further support this mission offers. As we did in preparation for the current and previous administration, we are starting now to prepare new scenario's, policy options and an estimate of the needed investments. We expect that a new goal will focus on the urban area (excluding the Port &amp; Industry which are largely part of the Emission Trading Scheme). The underlying policies and portfolio of actions are as we speak topic of engagement with our local stakeholders.

## 3) Strategic Priorities

With our stakeholders we are focusing currently on a number of strategic priorities as set out in our climate action plan (Klimaatactieplan Rotterdam). The focus is on actions in the urban area on mobility, build environment and energy. For many of those actions', agreements between the municipality and specific stakeholders exist which are frequently updated. In this section we will highlight in brief the structures, priorities and actions on which the municipality and stakeholders work together to support our overall goal. A set out in the action plan, for a part we are currently reassessing these targets and ambitions in collaboration with our stakeholders.

## A) Energy

Together with our stakeholders we are working towards a sustainable energy system. Realising new sources of sustainable energy (solar, wind) and expanding current and new infrastructure so other domains gain access on time to become fossil free.

## Solar

For 2030, the goal is 3.4 km² of new solar-PV's, which translates in a total of 1,889,000 solar panels. To stimulate, the municipality offers free advice and help towards business buildings. For residential buildings and utilities, the municipality works together with 'Energy of Rotterdam', a support platform for citizens and businesses who want to start their own energy community. This support platform was set up as a result of one of the climate deals in the RKA.

## Wind

The city-regional covenant (2012) and the port covenant (2009) include agreements to generate a minimum of 350 megawatts of wind energy. These targets are also part of the regional ambitions for sustainable generation by 2030, as set out in the Regional Energy Strategy (July 1, 2021), an agreement between the 23 municipalities, who are part of the Metropolitan Area Rotterdam-The Hague. Discussions on the post-2030 ambition has started.

## Infrastructure (electricity and gas)

We are working towards a sustainable, robust, flexible but also fair energy system. In the coming years, the focus will primarily be on the electricity grid, where developments such as transport electrification, heat demand but also industrial processes result in capacity shortages on the grid, or grid congestion. Currently, one of the main barriers to address to prevent slowing down the energy transition. The municipality and the grid operator Stedin, who is also responsible for phasing out the (fossil) gas-infrastructure, have agreed on a common Strategic Action Agenda for the period 2024 – 2026. This will be regularly updated and discussed very half year. It contains various concrete work-packages and actions towards our goal. Stedin also participates in the current updating of our policy and ambition on natural-gas-free neighbourhoods, which will be decided upon in 2026, which is relevant to prevent unnecessary electrification of the heath demand and the removal of gas-infrastructure.

## B) Build Environment

The Built Environment consists of residential and non-residential construction. Non-residential construction refers to buildings without a residential function, such as hospitals,

commercial buildings, offices, and schools. Rotterdam has a total of 321.500 residential buildings of which almost 40% is owned by social housing companies, 20% by private landlords and the rest are owner-occupied housing. Most of the last-ones are part of a house-owner-association of which a majority agreement is needed to invest in sustainability. We have a variety of ways to collaborate and/or help and stimulate these groups towards a sustainable build environment. With the social housing companies there is a governance structure and underlying agreements on targets and monitoring. In 2023 a Platform Private Landlords Rotterdam (PPVR) was created with the largest private landlords who want to rent properly, be entrepreneurial and be more visible as role models, with whom we develop support measures for also the smaller landlords to fulfil their obligations on insulation (minimal label C in 2029) and natural-gas-free. For private home-owners a Platform House Owner Associations was part of a climate deal (RKA) in 2020, whose members are expanding ever since.

## Natural-gas-free Neighbourhoods

We are working towards 85.000 natural-gas-free residential building in 2030. These will mainly be connected to district heating. Almost half of these residential buildings are owned by social housing companies. After the climate deals between the corporations and municipality concrete 'Performance Agreements' have been made to implement these deals. These agreements are monitored and updated bi-annually.

District heating in Rotterdam is owned and developed by two (private) companies; Vattenfall and Eneco (owned by Mitshubishi) with whom we have concession agreement. Due to new legislation, these are being revised.

## Insulation and energy saving

Our goal is to have all residential buildings having at least an energy label 'C' in 2030. This amounts to a total of 97.000 buildings. 33.000 are of private home-owners, 46.600 of social housing companies and 21.00 of private landlords. With the social housing companies, we have made concrete plans for 12.000 as agreed in the above mentioned performance agreements for the next 2 years and still 33.000 to pick up after 2026. For the remainder of 29.000 for private homeowners, continuation of the current grants from the national government is essential for which we have currently only concrete plans for 4.000.

## Energy poverty

In the wake of the international energy crisis the municipality and the social housing companies made an agreement to help 5000 rental homes. Seven Rotterdam housing corporations are implementing various energy-saving measures in their homes in 2023-2024, thus reducing their tenants' energy bills. These include the replacement and water-side adjustment of central heating boilers, the installation of hybrid heat pumps and solar panels, and the deployment of energy coaches.

## New Buildings

Since new building by law are obliged to be build natural-gas-free and energy neutral, are focus is to try to get them more 'Paris-proof', including thus circularity and other emissions during the building process, in line with the EU-taxonomy. The different parties who participate in the Platform Developers Rotterdam (developers, builders, municipality, social housing companies) have for this purpose agreed upon a Sustainable Building Approach

(2024). This focuses on a variety of actions which are monitored, like setting up a Climate Academy and a Field Lab, education named Green Workforce, developing of standard calculations and sharing results online.

## Mobility

We are committed to make mobility fossil free in 2040. This requires making the inner city more car-free, clean rides and thus electric driving (energy transition), making motorized traffic emission-free, including mobile equipment, vans and trucks, and investing and making public transport more attractive throughout the city, including investing in the quality and quantity of Park&amp;Ride (P&amp;R) facilities linked to the main urban public transport links.

## Charging infrastructure

Aan important partner for charging infrastructure is the national government with whom we collaborate within the National Approach Charging-infrastructure (NAL) and which funds the municipal investments and actions. Locally we have agreements with social housing compagnies (Performance Agreements) and support house-owners-associations and employers.

## Passenger transport

As a result of the RKA in 2021 a Climate Alliance Sustainable Mobility was launched in 2021 with more than 20 employers committed to reduce their emissions caused by commuting with -55% in 2030. Since then more-and-more employers are joining this alliance which currently accounts to 170 employers with over a 170.000 employees in the Rotterdam area. Specific for taxi's in 2022 a Zero Emission Taxi Agreement Framework (2022) was agreed upon to stimulate and enforce the electrification of taxi's.

## Logistics

To prepare and ensure a smooth introduction of the Zero Emission Zone for logistics, which came in effect his year, in 2020 the municipality and compagnies agreed upon a Covenant Zero Emission City Logistics Rotterdam. Together we decided upon the precise size and step-by-step inclusion of different types of vehicles. Where the zone currently is in effect for new vehicles, in 2030 it also includes existing vehicles. After 2030 the zone will be step-by-step extended to cover the whole city.

## Other

In 2024 the municipality, the Port of Rotterdam and many other compagnies and municipalities signed the 'Covenant Clean and Zero Emission Building' with the national government on reducing the emissions as a result of mobile machinery used for building activities. We agreed upon reduction targets and ambitions for 2030 to contribute to: 60% NOx emission reduction compared to 2018 (Nitrogen Reduction and Nature Improvement); 75% health gain compared to 2016 (Clean Air Agreement); 0.4 Mton CO2 emission reduction compared to 2019 (Climate Agreement); Climate neutral and circular national infrastructure projects by 2030.

# 4) Proces and Principles

As the previous sections showed, climate action in Rotterdam, working towards a climate neutral city, is by definition a multi-stakeholder process. Since the RKA, as set out in the introduction, working on the bases of a overall climate agreement has progressed towards a more multi-faceted collaboration. The municipality and our local stakeholders are working together in a variety of ways, with a continuously expanding network(s) and deepening the connections and actions between stakeholders. Depending on the sector, topic and phase of development, agreements are made and/or updated, governance structures put in place and monitored and updated. In the next update of the CCC we are sure we can show the growing involvement of stakeholders with whom we collaborate on climate actions.

Our KAR, as a overall monitoring tool, gives the municipality and stakeholders the necessary insight of progress and the task ahead. The updating of our KAR and underlying policies and actions, the municipality does with the involvement of our local stakeholders. Together we make this city!

We do this following these guiding principles:

We keep the energy transition affordable for everyone and prevent and combat energy poverty;
We are committed to maximum CO2 reduction at minimum social cost;
We ensure a level playing field: the polluter pays;
We use the energy and raw materials transition as a flywheel for entrepreneurship and additional jobs (especially for people distanced from the labor market);
We ensure that companies and employees are enabled to take the steps in the energy transition as well as possible and in consultation, and we also use the energy transition to strengthen our (international) competitive position;
We focus on measures at the interface of health and combating climate change. Think of: emission-free mobility, sustainable building and improving air quality;
We are committed to a clean, safe and reliable energy supply;
We are committed to no-regret decisions and we keep room in our choices for new solutions and future innovations;
Through our commitment to raw materials transition, we aim to reduce CO2 emissions elsewhere in the world;
We test all our decisions against the objective of energy transition, now and in the future;
As a municipality, we set a good example ourselves;
We ensure maximum involvement of and information to residents;
We actively steer our participations from our shareholder role. And specifically for the Port of Rotterdam Authority to support the Port of Rotterdam in their efforts to combat climate change.
