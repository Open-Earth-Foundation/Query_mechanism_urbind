# 1 Introduction

## Introduction

Wroclaw is a city that sets ambitious sustainable development goals. As the third largest city in Poland, Wroclaw is one of the key actors contributing to the implementation of the regional and national goals of a climate-neutral Lower Silesia and a climate-neutral Poland.

Wroclaw and its Functional Urban Area are a dynamically developing city in terms of economic and demographic indicators. Achieving climate goals must go hand in hand with maintaining this development. This requires a fair energy transformation in the spirit of "leaving no one behind" but also actions in the social sphere in order to reduce energy poverty. On the one hand, Wroclaw has reduced emissions from the industrial sector and, to a small extent, built environment, but transportation emissions are growing noticeably, and in recent years, emissions from the built sector have increased again due to dynamic spatial development.

Wroclaw Climate City Contract defines the portfolio of actions of the municipality and its stakeholders, impact pathways and investment plan in six areas of interest: energy (energy and heating system), transport and mobility, built environment, waste and sewage management, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, and industry. Key actions aim to: decarbonisation of electricity and heat production, reducing electricity and heat consumption, expansion of decarbonised district heating and reduction of emissions from road traffic.

Over the last years, Wroclaw has been implementing an ambitious vision of transforming the city into a coal-free zone, where residents have access to reliable, clean, sustainable and affordable energy. Wroclaw aims to become a city that is aware, resilient, responsible and ready for the challenges of the future, that protects and develops its natural capital and ensures safety and sustainable socio-economic development for its residents. To this end, the city is active in the international forum and is an active member of European initiatives aimed at changing the energy and climate policy of cities, including the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI). Wroclaw is also a signatory to the open letter of the Mayors of 58 cities within the Eurocities network addressed in 2020 to the Presidents of the European Council, expressing the need to increase, with the support of the EU, emission reductions in cities to 65% by 2030.

In 2019, Wroclaw, acting under the Covenant of Mayors, prepared a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) as a key instrument for implementing the agreement. The SECAP identified key measures that the city will undertake to achieve its climate neutrality goal. The plan also includes mapping of climate change risks and vulnerabilities, adaptation measures, emission calculations, emission reduction scenarios and impact estimates of the measures.

Based on the prepared strategic documents, city policies and action plans as well as accompanying incentive and support tools, the following activities were implemented:

Replacing heat sources based on solid fuels (coal and its derivatives) in single-family and multi-family buildings with ecological, less emission systems based on district heating, electricity, gas or heat pumps, classified as renewable energy sources.
Implementation of the so-called "Small RES Programme", under which municipal institutions are equipped with RES installations, thanks to which their number in Wroclaw is gradually growing every year. As a standard, newly constructed municipal facilities already meet the standards of sustainable buildings, are equipped with photovoltaics, green walls and roofs, and rainwater management installations. In addition, municipal companies' facilities are also equipped with installations for obtaining energy from renewable sources from other funds.

Thanks to the property tax exemption system for investing your own funds in renewable energy, we are seeing a rapid increase in renewable energy in Wroclaw. In 2019-2023 alone, exemptions were granted for the amount of over PLN 29 million, which illustrates the scale of the activities.

An agreement on the establishment of an energy cluster is planned to be signed between the city of Wroclaw and the rectors of all Wroclaw universities in October this year. This is an innovative approach on a national scale and a direct result of Wroclaw's participation in the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission.

Cooperation between the City and energy and heating companies within the so-called Decarbonisation Table. The state-owned heating company KOGENERACJA¹, which supplies district heating to the residents of Wroclaw, plans to modernise its production capacities by 2028, replacing coal fuel with gas and heat pumps. Thanks to close cooperation with the city within the aforementioned partnership, a common direction has been given to decarbonisation goals, resulting from Wroclaw's participation in the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, and a high priority has been given to supporting investments in the modernisation of district heating sources in the city.

Implementation by FORTUM SA, the operator of district heating in Wroclaw and MWSC – the Municipal Water and Sewage Company of the innovative WROMPA project, consisting in the recovery of heat from sewage. On one of the sewage collectors, the second largest heat pump in Europe was installed. The implementation of the project will provide 5% of Wroclaw's demand for district heating.

Development of the public transport network, including the improvement of the bus fleet with vehicles meeting the highest emission standards and electric vehicles. Currently, the Municipal Transport Company is also at the stage of testing hydrogen vehicles. Tram lines are being intensively expanded, in the last five years alone two new tram lines have been built and two more have been designed. It was also possible to sign an agreement on the development of the agglomeration railway with the Marshal of the Voivodeship, which allows the residents of Wroclaw to travel by train within the administrative boundaries of the city using a ticket for public transport. Travel by rail is the most desired means of public transport by residents, which is why over 90% of tram tracks in Wroclaw are dedicated routes to increase comfort and shorten travel time for passengers, thus increasing the attractiveness of public transport in relation to travel by individual transport.

Expansion of the network of Park&amp;Ride parking lots near railway stations and tram terminals to reduce the number of cars entering the city centre.

In accordance with the Sustainable Mobility Policy, a pedestrian and bicycle programme is also being implemented, aimed at increasing the share of pedestrian and bicycle journeys. The development of so-called green ways is particularly desirable, which not only enables contact with nature during pedestrian and bicycle journeys, but also increases the thermal comfort of road users on hot days.

Development of green areas and implementation of the strategy for the development of blue-green infrastructure and management of rainwater and meltwater. The indicator of accessibility of green areas within 300 m from the place of residence is currently 84% in Wroclaw and 94.6% for the city centre and has been gradually increasing over the last few years. Taking into account the need to reduce the Urban Heat Island effect, the "Green Revolution" programme is being implemented, consisting in the protection and strengthening of the potential of existing

greenery and areas of natural value, creating new green areas, implementing tall greenery plantings in road areas (Green Arteries) and implementing unsealing of concreted courtyards of schools and kindergartens (Gray to Green). These are activities very high in the hierarchy of needs and expectations of Wroclaw residents.

Joining the European Commission's Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission initiative is a continuation and reinforcement of the activities carried out so far by setting a clearly defined goal for Wroclaw. Work on the Climate City Contract allows for building a transition team, parameterizing the emission level and addressing specific tasks to specific stakeholders adequately to the contribution in generated emissions. Participation in the Cities Mission also means building a multi-level partnership at the city, regional and national level. Considering the fact that the public sector is responsible for only 7% of emissions in Wroclaw, the involvement of other stakeholders is crucial. Moreover, within the 55% of emissions from buildings, a significant part of them falls on the energy and heating sector, therefore the cooperation established within the so-called Decarbonisation Table with utilities managers, which are mostly state-owned companies implementing the goals of national policy, is an absolute foundation for the success of achieving the assumed goals.

Based on the strategic documents adopted by the Wroclaw City Council in the field of climate and energy, Wroclaw declares that it will achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. Nevertheless, taking into account the deepening climate crisis and challenges resulting from the energy crisis caused by the armed conflict in Ukraine, it is necessary to accelerate actions in this area, hence Wroclaw's participation in the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission and the effort undertaken to set a path for reducing GHG emissions by 80% by 2030.

Simulations performed within the economic model show that such a scenario is possible, however, it must be borne in mind that it is highly dependent on the implementation of national policies and actions taken by energy and heating companies (state-owned companies), private entities and residents themselves (in terms of improving the energy efficiency of buildings they use), as the broadly understood city council is responsible for only 7% of all emissions.

In parallel with the work on the CCC and the economic model, a road map for achieving climate neutrality in Wroclaw is being created on behalf of the Climate and Energy Division of the Wroclaw City Office, presenting three scenarios for reducing GHG emissions: 1) a continuation scenario, 2) achievable and 3) progressive. The aim of the document is not only to collect information on generated emissions, to describe the possibilities and limitations resulting from city, regional and national policies, but also to analyse the cost-effectiveness of the Decarbonisation actions taken vs. the expected ecological effect.

The actions described in the CCC cover the entire area of the city within its administrative boundaries. We do not make any subject or subject exclusions here. One of the added values of this document is the fact that it constitutes an integration of all processes taking place in the city and overturns the stereotypical approach limited only to the formal authority of the city president. With such an approach, the goal set in the Mission of Cities would not be possible to achieve. Only a comprehensive approach and multi-level inter-sectoral partnership give a chance for the success of the entire initiative.

Based on the structure of emissions from the GHG inventory and analyses within the economic model, it can be stated that in Wroclaw, activities in 3 areas are key: production of electricity and heat, renovation of the building stock and transport. An additional area is adaptation to climate change through the development of blue-green infrastructure and protection of existing greenery and unsealing of hardened surfaces in order to minimize the UHI effect.

Wroclaw's participation in the Mission of Climate Neutral and Smart Cities was a very important step in legitimising a systemic approach to the city's climate ambitions and giving them high priority not only within Wroclaw Municipality structures but also among external stakeholders.

Building a strong internal and external mandate and precisely parameterising both the challenges related to generated GHG emissions and the needs related to their reduction was a huge challenge.

However, the effort put into the over two-year process of preparing the climate contract, in retrospect, we consider valuable and desirable.

The city has been implementing activities for Decarbonisation and sustainable development for many years. However, for a long time these were grassroots activities, implemented by units, divisions and municipal companies without systemic coordination. As a result, the city's resources and funds allocated for this purpose were not optimally used due to the lack of synergy and systemic planning. The plans and programmes created in the city were sectoral in nature.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Figure 1. The scheme of local coalition during building the Wroclaw Transition Team (Net Zero Cities).

As a first step toward making the city's climate neutrality efforts systemic, the Mayor of Wroclaw established the City Mission Team in October 2022. It includes representatives of all city departments, units and companies, and meetings are cyclical in nature to ensure an adequate flow of information and a platform for cross-sectoral cooperation.

At the same time, networking outside of the office's structures has been underway with the academic community, developers, housing cooperatives, NGOs and residents. In each of the communities, a leader emerged who was the contact person and voice of his environment.

Very important was the establishment in June 2023 of a partnership for Decarbonisation of the district heating system, the so-called Decarbonisation table, which succeeded in establishing in one body an unprecedented cooperation of power companies, district heating companies, gas companies, the municipal water and sewer company, the municipal investment and environmental services and municipal planners. The declaration of joint work for the Decarbonisation of Wroclaw was of particular importance in the context of the fact that the Decarbonisation of the power and heating systems depends to a great extent on the success of achieving the assumed goal of reducing  $80\%$  of Wroclaw's GHG emissions.

An absolute breakthrough in contacts with Wroclaw companies was the Mission 1.5 Degree Wroclaw conference organized in May 2024, during which companies were invited to sign a declaration

of cooperation to achieve the goals set in the Mission and the CCC. The response and openness of Wroclaw companies to cooperation with the City exceeded our expectations and is a good prognosis for the future.

As part of building regional support for the intentions expressed in the CCC, a cooperation agreement for the climate neutrality of the city and region was signed with the Institute for Territorial Development - a structure at the provincial level corresponding to the Department of Strategy and Sustainable Development. The Institute for Territorial Development has prepared the Energy Strategy of Lower Silesia, adopted by the Voivodeship Board in 2022, which indicates the directions of energy development in the region taking into account the current challenges of climate change and the necessary energy transition activities to be carried out in accordance with the policy directions of the European Union.

The parties plan to develop cooperation in which other municipalities in the Lower Silesia region will benefit from Wroclaw's experience in determining the city's Decarbonisation path.

On the other hand, at the government level, thanks to the cooperation within the coalition of five Polish cities, it was possible during the six-month workshop to develop not only the support of the Ministry of Climate and Environment for the actions included in the CCC of Wroclaw and the city's climate ambitions, but also to build a platform for cooperation, without which the implementation of the goals described in this document would not be possible.

The work on the CCC assumed from the beginning the iterative nature of the document, especially in the context of the fact that the broad magistrate is responsible for only 7% of all GHG emissions in the city, with the remaining 93% of emissions resulting from the activities of state-owned enterprises, private companies and residents. Therefore, the transition team that has been built is crucial in further action. We assume close cooperation with all stakeholder circles to monitor the progress of the implementation of the actions assumed in the CCC, coordinate with each other and obtain synergies.

The expectation of the magistrate's role as coordinator of the entire process is already apparent, which is absolutely understandable and natural. Immediately after the completion of work on the Climate City Contract (CCC) and the Climate Neutrality Roadmap for Wroclaw, an update of the SECAP and Climate Change Adaptation Plan is planned so that all documents are consistent with each other. Both the SECAP and the MPA are adopted by resolutions of the Wroclaw City Council, which means that they are given a high profile and continue to dedicate city funds to the activities described in the CCC.

Finally, it should be mentioned that as part of the ongoing work on the Strategy of Wroclaw 2050, issues related to climate neutrality and energy security have been given a very high priority and elevated to the level of strategic goals, which will mean the need to monitor the progress of implementation of the set objectives on an annual basis.

## Economic characteristics of the city

Wroclaw is the dominant centre of the Wroclaw Urban Functional Area, where higher-level functions - related to administration, business, economy and trade, culture, and science focusing on higher education and innovation of research and scientific centres - are concentrated. It is a place of transnational investment attractiveness. The city is one of the largest economic centres in the country, dominated by such industries as automotive, consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, information technology, and the production of household appliances and consumer electronics. A strong position in the city's economy is occupied by services in the fields of information and communication, finance and accounting, information technology and those included in the group of professional, scientific and technical activities, as well as services related to entertainment, leisure and recreation gaining in importance.

An important role in the economy of Wroclaw is played by, having a supra-regional character, science and business parks, industrial and technological parks, as well as innovation and entrepreneurship

centres (among others: Wroclaw Industrial Park, Wroclaw Technology Park/Wroclawski Park technologiczny, Lower Silesian Science and Innovation Park, Lower Silesian Science and Technology Incubator). Also important institutions influencing the development of innovation in the city are the Wroclaw Research Centre EIT+, the Lower Silesian Academic Business Incubator, as well as academic business incubators operating at several universities. Businesses operating in Wroclaw include: 3M, GE POWER, LG Philips, Volvo, Whirlpool, Bosch, Toshiba, US PHARMACIA, WAGO ELWAG, AB, AmRest Holdings SE, Neonet, Work Service, Impel Group, Incom, PFG Urtica, Sudzucker Polska, Selena FM, KOGENERACJA., Wabco Poland. Wroclaw is also an investment destination for BPO services (Business Process Offshoring - service centres for the parent organization in accounting and finance, IT, research and development). Companies operating in this service sector include: HP, UPS, GE Money Bank or Credit Suisse. There is also a growing business services and development sector for the telecommunications industry, represented by companies such as Nokia Siemens Networks and Tieto. Due to the city's location on the Oder River, river shipyards also operate in the city.

## Demographic situation

One of the factors influencing the city's development is the demographic situation and the prospects for its change. An increase in the number of residents means an increase in the number of consumers, and thus an increase in the demand for energy and its carriers - both networked and in the form of solid or liquid fuels. According to official demographic data, 673,743 residents live in Wroclaw (as of the end of 2023, the Statistics Poland). This number is steadily growing (about 7% over the period 2010 - 2023). According to the Report - Estimating the actual number of residents of Wroclaw, prepared in 2023 by the University of Wroclaw, the values determined on the basis of the population registered in public statistics do not reflect the actual state. According to the detailed analysis conducted for the purposes of the aforementioned Report, the estimated actual population was determined to be 893,506 people (as of 31/12/2022). This indicates a significant disparity between the CSO data and the data resulting from the Report - the difference is at 219,427 people.

A large impact on demographic changes is exerted by domestic and foreign migration, which has particularly gained momentum as a result of the opening of foreign labor markets. On a national scale, Wroclaw is one of the largest economic centers and the only city in the area surrounded by smaller urban and rural communities, which has a direct impact on the demography and use of the city.

## Development characteristics

According to data from 2021, there are 360,200 housing units in Wroclaw, with a total area of 21.2 million square meters, located in 52,000 buildings (according to the 2021 National Census). The area of municipal buildings is about 1,560 thousand square meters. The average square meterage of one apartment is 59 m². Residential buildings account for more than 66% of all buildings in the city.

In terms of floor area, residential buildings, built between 1918 and 1944, and objects erected between 1989 and 2002, dominate. Buildings from the first of the above-mentioned time intervals often deviate from today's standards in terms of construction solutions, partitions and energy systems. At the same time, some of the objects are under conservation protection. Objects erected in later years, until 2002, constitute the largest group of buildings. At the same time, they are characterized by very different solutions and varying degrees of thermo-modernisation.

The energy consumption of buildings, in addition to their size and year of construction, is influenced by its type. Among the most important building types are:

Townhouses - buildings erected with traditional technology, often forming part of the development in the centre of the city, with high floors, there are often mixed heating sources, some are under conservation protection.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Urban villas - pre-war construction characteristic of Wroclaw (examples of occurrence in the city: Grabiszynek, Zacisze, Zalesie, Karlowice district).
Residential blocks, so called "block of flats" - buildings erected in large-panel system construction, heated in different ways, but mostly uniform within the building. Some of the buildings have undergone thermal modernisation.
Houses of the "cube" type - a characteristic norm of single-family housing from the 1970s and 1980s occurring in the form of an intrusion in many urban areas of the city,
Developer buildings - erected after 1990, various technologies, in large part traditional with hollow blocks. The state of insulation of the partitions depends on the technical requirements current at the date of obtaining a building permit. Heating system within a building uniform.
Single-family buildings - erected mainly in traditional technology from hollow blocks. The state of insulation of partitions depends on the technical requirements current at the date of obtaining a building permit. A large proportion of buildings have replaced window frames, but do not have insulated external walls. Individual heating system of various types. Buildings erected after 2014 partly use modern, in today's terms, technical solutions...
Buildings in rural character - that is, buildings expansively absorbed by the city with the shift of its borders after the war (mainly in the 1970s) covering former villages (homestead and single-family buildings).

It is estimated that residential buildings modernised to a significant degree (insulating the external envelope, replacing woodwork, modernizing the heating system) account for 10-20% of buildings. The remainder are partially or not at all modernised buildings.

The number of housing units put into use in recent years shows a high dynamics, the direct reasons for which include social (lifestyle, income growth) and geopolitical changes in recent years. Buildings constructed after 2017 are expected to achieve a high degree of energy efficiency, with the latest technical requirements in this regard coming into force in 2021. About 10,000 residential units have been put into service every year in recent years.

Buildings with a non-residential function account for approx. 33.4% of the city's total building area (about 10,660,000 square meters of floor space).

Number of buildings and usable area of all buildings located in Wroclaw :

|  TOTAL | 68,094 | 31,918,438.14 | 100%  |

Within the city of Wroclaw, there are 1,117 buildings listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments and 9,511 buildings listed in the Municipal Record of Monuments. In addition to the buildings listed in the Register and Record, Conservation Protection Zones has been introduced, which also set up restrictions regarging modernisation of buildings. The total area of buildings under conservation protection in the city is 1,212,693.56 m2, which is less than 4% of the floor area of all buildings in the city.

## District heating system

The city's district heating system consists of district heating networks and the heat sources supplying them. The owner of the heat distribution system is Fortum Power and Heat Power, and the source supplying the system is KOGENERACJA.

The Wroclaw district heating system consists of water district heating networks built in ring and radial systems in traditional duct and pre-insulated technology with a total length of 590 km. In 2019 - 2022 there was a significant development of the network, the total length increased by 43 km (nearly 8%). The share of the network in modern pre-insulated technology is of the order of 55%. Heat losses on Fortum's district heating network in Wroclaw in 2022 amounted to 12.4% and were practically equal to the average amount of losses from 2018 - 2021 (12.6%). The average losses in district heating companies according to the ERO report "Thermal energy in numbers - 2020" were 18.8%. Thus, the level of heat losses in 2018 - 2022 can be considered good and stable - no clear trends of change, which is favourable in a situation of systematic growth of new sections of the district heating network. Thus, under the existing conditions, one can speak of a positive trend in reducing heat losses. This trend is the result of systematic modernisation of the network (replacement of the duct network with a preinsulated one), as well as a gradual increase in the efficiency of leak detection by maintenance services.

Wroclaw's district heating system consists of a main district heating system supplied from EC Wroclaw and EC Czechnica expanded primarily in the central and southern parts of the city, as well as a local system supplied from EC Zawidawie in the area of the Psie Pole district.

The district heating system of Wroclaw currently has the status of an energy-efficient system according to the criteria described in the Energy Law Act and the EED Directive. The share of heat supplied to the district heating network, generated in renewable heat source installations (use of biomass in EC Czechnica), and usable heat generated in cogeneration exceeds the required 50%. This allows the use of aid funds for the development and modernisation of the system. The primary fuel for heat production in this system is still hard coal, which translates into a relatively high emission factor for network heat in the city. The average emission factor of heat supplied to consumers by district heating companies according to the URE report "Thermal energy in numbers - 2020" was 347.4 kgCO2/MWh (96.5 kgCO2/GJ), so Wroclaw's - is at a similar level.

The characteristics of Wroclaw's district heating system presented above indicate that the main determinant for achieving climate neutrality in this area is the modernisation and reconstruction of its power supply system, aimed at building low-carbon and climate-neutral heat sources for the district heating network.

## Electric power system

The city's power system is made up of power grids at different voltage levels and their power sources in the form of local producers and substations that are connected to the national PSE power system. In the process of ensuring the supply of electricity to consumers in the Wroclaw area, energy

companies involved in: generation, transmission and distribution of energy participate. An important group are also trading companies, selling electricity to final consumers.

The main producer of electricity in the city is KOGENERACJA. Electricity is produced in cogeneration sources. Electricity comes from the combustion of conventional fuels (coal, heavy fuel oil) and from the combustion of biomass in a fluidized bed boiler (light fuel oil is an auxiliary fuel) and using an internal combustion engine that uses natural gas.

In the area of Wroclaw, Polish Power System Operation² (PSE) does not have substations and power lines. The main sources of electricity supply to Wroclaw are elements of the highest voltage power infrastructure, owned by PSE, located outside the city limits: the 400/110 kV Wroclaw and 400/110 kV Pasikurowice substations, as well as electricity sources of the mentioned enterprises and individual owners.

## Public transportation system

Public transportation in Wroclaw is made up of trams, buses and railroads, the latter of which is not dependent on municipal transportation decisions. However, given the structure and richness of the railroad network within Wroclaw, it should be said that this network should become an equal component of the public transport system. And from a structural point of view, this is so - for it surrounds the entire downtown with a ring, intersecting with tram and bus routes running radially. These three elements of the public transportation system: tram, bus and rail, should form an integrated system and be the basis of a well-functioning city. At present, these are still two independently functioning systems, the integration of which is becoming one of the priorities of the provincial government. A positive first step in the process of integrating the rail and urban systems is the introduction of an integrated ticket for urban public transportation and rail transportation.

The dynamic growth of residential development on the outskirts of the city necessitates the development of public transportation, which is currently lagging behind spatial development.

## Bicycle traffic

The network of bicycle routes in Wroclaw includes more than 360 km of routes of different nature: separated roads, pedestrian and bicycle paths, bicycle lanes and 99 km of routes on the dikes, which are an important element of the whole system. The low-lying and flat terrain of Wroclaw is conducive to the promotion of the bicycle as a cheap, healthy and generally accessible means of locomotion, not only in tourism and recreation, but first of all in relieving the burden on car and mass transport in everyday travel, including to work and to the place of study. Wroclaw has very favourable conditions for bicycle transportation - a warm climate, flat terrain and a well-planned urban layout. The city's assets also include an exceptionally large number of students and young people employed in modern companies that support ecological forms of transportation, and the openness of society to modern ecological trends.

In 2010, the Bicycle Policy of Wroclaw was adopted, which is part of the city's development strategy aimed at ensuring a high quality of life in the city. The policy's assumptions provide for the promotion of an efficient and clean form of transportation, such as the bicycle, which is expected to become an alternative means of transportation in the city. The main challenge of the policy is to strive for a 15% share of bicycle traffic by 2020 (in 2018, according to the Comprehensive Traffic Survey, this share was 6.3%). Adopted in 2013. Wroclaw Mobility Policy identifies the bicycle - alongside public transportation - as the basis for sustainable transportation in the city, which should be developed and promoted.

## Pedestrian traffic

² Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne S.A.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The large share of pedestrian traffic in the total number of trips in the city is one of the most important factors determining the city's friendliness to residents. Pedestrian traffic and the way it functions affect the assessment of the quality of life in the city.

In the structure of the city, it is possible to distinguish the most important areas of spatial activities relevant to pedestrian traffic. These include:

a) the centre of the city, and therein separate pedestrian zones, woonerfs, promenades along the city moat, a system of boulevards and pedestrian routes on embankments along rivers, collision-free crossings eliminating various types of pedestrian barriers,
b) residential neighbourhoods with separate neighbourhood pedestrian routes, streets in residential zones,
c) green and recreational areas, with green promenades, paths and tracts,
d) pedestrian links between the city centre, residential areas and green and recreational areas, as well as important elements of the transport system, such as interchanges.

In 2015, a coordinator for pedestrian development was appointed in Wroclaw, following the example of the coordinator for bicycle development, whose task is to ensure the comfort and high quality of infrastructure for pedestrian traffic and promote this form of travel as one of the best ways to move around the city.

# Sewage and waste management

The central and southern parts of Wroclaw are dominated by a combined sewer system receiving sanitary sewage and rainwater and snowmelt, based on the historical layout of the network. In the rest of the area and in the settlements that are sewered today, there is a distribution sewer system, i.e. a separate sanitary sewer system and a rainwater drainage system. The core of the system is made up of the main sewers, the combined sewers: Oder, Sleza, Bystrzyca, South, North, West.

Due to the terrain, there are 41 municipal sewage pumping stations and 1 rainwater pumping station in the sewage collection system. Sanitary and combined sewage pumping stations pump on average, counting together with the main pumping station of the Wroclaw Sewage Treatment Plant Janowek, about 82 million m3 of sewage per year. The Wroclaw Sewage Treatment Plant Janowek is a mechanical-biological treatment plant with chemical support for the removal of phosphorus compounds.

Part of the sewage network dates back several decades and requires corrective measures. However, the programme of modernisation and reconstruction of the network, carried out by Municipal Water and Sewage Company for many years, makes it possible to provide the residents of Wroclaw with sewage collection services at an appropriately high level. The planned investment activities, in addition to the expansion of the network in the newly developing settlements, will also include the renovation and reconstruction of the main sewers, gradually increasing the safety of the system. In areas not equipped with sanitary sewerage systems, domestic sewage is mostly discharged into non-drainage tanks.

Among others, the city has the following waste management facilities - active facilities and installations related to waste collection and processing, which are:

a) a waste transfer station with a municipal waste sorting plant and an alternative fuel production line, as well as two transfer stations,
b) green waste composting plant,
c) waste processing facilities,
d) two Selective municipal waste collection points (PSZOK),
e) a landfill for sewage waste,
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

f) other waste collection and processing facilities operated by entities with the appropriate permits for waste collection and processing, and about 30 smaller waste processing facilities.

The majority of municipal waste is transferred to facilities located outside the city, including the Regional Installation for Municipal Waste Processing (RIPOK) facilities of the region in Rudna Wielka, Jaroszow, Kryniczno.

# 2 Part A – Current State of Climate Action

## 2.1. Module A-1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline Inventory

### GHG Emissions Baseline inventory

The first step to understanding the sources and magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions in Wroclaw was to develop an emissions inventory. Wroclaw has been performing a GHG emissions inventory since 2014, which was originally linked to the adoption of the Low Emission Economy Programme. Subsequently, due to the signing of the Covenant of Mayors (CoM) by Wroclaw, this inventory also served and continues to serve the needs of SECAP³, the Covenant of Mayors and CDP/ICLEI, as well as in the application phase for the City Mission.

The Municipality of Wroclaw reports emissions according to the GPC standard at the BASIC level, meeting the requirements of the Covenant of Mayors and the Global Covenant for Climate and Energy. Currently, the GHG inventories contain all the required data for BASIC reporting and most of the data needed at the BASIC+ level (BASIC+ reporting will be possible after making the necessary additions and changes to the inventory).

The results of the inventory have so far been used for reporting in the CoM and CDP/ICLEI as well as the Low-Emission Economy Plan for Integrated Territorial Investments of the Wroclaw Functional Area⁴ and SECAP monitoring. In the case of the CoM and CDP/ICLEI, however, this reporting was not continuous and complete due to a lack of staffing and adequate commitment to the topic of striving for climate neutrality. It was not until the participation in the City Mission that there was a renewed impetus to take a closer look at the results of the inventory and prioritise actions in terms of their impact on reducing emissions in the city.

So far, the GHG emissions inventory performed for the Low-Emission Economy Plan for Integrated Territorial Investments of the Wroclaw Functional Area and SECAP has been the only source of information for identifying the main emission sectors in the city. However, in the course of the work in the Cities Mission, another analytical tool has emerged to identify GHG emissions, to identify the emission gap resulting from the city's actions and to indicate the relevant economic parameters of the actions. This tool is the economic model made available within the NZC. While the greenhouse gas emissions inventory only gave us information on emissions in the previous year, the economic model makes it possible to indicate future

³ Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan aims to reduce carbon emissions and promote renewable energy use in Wroclaw, essential for achieving climate neutrality by 2050.

⁴ This plan outlines strategies to transition the Wroclaw Functional Area to a low-emission economy through integrated territorial investments. It focuses on reducing carbon emissions, promoting renewable energy, and enhancing energy efficiency across the functional area. Crucial for achieving regional climate goals and sustainability targets.

emissions according to the so-called 'Business as Usual BAU2030' scenario and on the basis of assumptions of possible emission reduction scenarios that are most economically viable. Wroclaw, during its participation in the Cities Mission, collected the most recent input data for the model, independently of the collection of data for the inventory, and defined assumptions for activities up to 2030.

The emissions obtained in the model and the inventory differ from each other due to the type of data set used in both studies. However, the structure of emissions by sector and the proportions of these emissions remain similar in principle. Therefore, it was decided to show the results of both studies in this part of the CCC.

# Greenhouse gas emissions based on the Greenhouse Gas Inventory for the Municipality of Wroclaw (2022)

Emission inventories are performed in accordance with the 'Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories. An Accounting and Reporting Standard for Cities" (hereafter referred to as the GPC guidelines). The inventory principles according to the GPC are in line with the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, making it possible to transfer the inventory results to the level of national GHG emission inventories performed for the UNFCCC. They incorporate the guidance provided in the guidebook 'How to develop a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP)'.

The inventory covers the administrative area of the municipality, which is in line with the scope of the CCC reported within the Cities Mission. A territorial approach is used for determining the GHG emissions balance (scope 1 emissions), but it is extended to include emissions resulting from electricity and heat consumption generated outside the municipality (scope 2 emissions) and those resulting from the management of waste generated in the municipality (scope 3 emissions) $^6$ .

The inventory is performed for one full calendar year. The base year (representing a benchmark) for the GHG emission inventory, according to the assumptions adopted in the Low-Emission Economy Plan for Integrated Territorial Investments of the Wroclaw Functional Area, is the year 1990. As the data on which the inventory is based for the year 1990 are strongly estimated and based on archival data, not always complete, they are characterised by a high uncertainty of estimation. Therefore, for the purposes of the CCC, we will refer to 2018 (as a year with data not disturbed by e.g. COVID-19 pandemic) and to 2022, for which we have the latest inventory. For these years, this is a much better estimate based on the latest available statistics.

The inventory covers all GHGs emitted in significant quantities within the administrative boundaries of Wroclaw, although it focuses on  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions or converts them into  $\mathrm{eCO}_{2}$ . Global warming potentials (GWPs) have been adopted in accordance with IPCC 5AR $^{7}$ .

The classification of emission sources is based on the division into Sectors, Subsectors and Categories. The division is based on the GPC classification, which has been adapted to the layout resulting from the Low-Emission Economy Plan for Integrated Territorial Investments of the Wroclaw Urban Functional Area structure (some sub-sectors have been transferred to other sectors). The emission inventory was broken down into the following sectors:

Sector I. Energy use in buildings and appliances (stationary fuel combustion) - scope 1 and 2:
Subsector I.1. Residential buildings,
Subsector I.2. Institutional, commercial buildings and facilities (including municipal facilities and public lighting)

Sustainable Energy Action Plan

The term 'scope' used corresponds to the English term 'scope' used in the GPC guidelines

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

○ Subsector I.4. Energy - direct emissions from energy are not included in the balance, they are reported informatively (they are included indirectly, as Scope 2 - electricity and heat use - attributing the resulting emissions to individual energy end-users).
○ Subsector I.8 Fugitive emissions from oil and gas distribution systems.

• Sector II. Transport (non-stationary fuel combustion) - scope 1 and 2:
○ Sub-sector II.1 Road transport (including public collective transport - buses),
○ Subsector II.2 Rail transport (including collective public transport - trams),
○ Sub-sector II.3 Waterborne transport,
○ Sub-sector II.4 Air transport,
○ Sub-sector II.5 Non-road transport.

• Sector III. Waste management - scope 1 and 3:
○ Sub-sector III.1 Solid waste management,
○ Subsector III.2 Biological treatment of waste,
○ Sub-sector III.4 Water and waste water management.

• Sector IV. Industry (IPPU) - scope 1 and 2:
○ Subsector I.3 Manufacturing industry and construction - combustion of fuels in industry for the production of energy for own use,
○ Subsector IV.1 Industrial production processes - direct (process) emissions,

• Sector V. Agriculture (AFOLU) - scope 1
○ Sub-sector I.5 Agriculture, forestry and fishing - scope 1 and 2
○ Subsector V.1 Livestock,
○ Subsector V.2 Land use,
○ Subsector V.3 Other sources.

The following sub-sectors were excluded from the scope (according to the methodology adopted in the Low-Emission Economy Plan for Integrated Territorial Investments of the Wroclaw Functional Area):
• Subsector I.7 Short-term fugitive emissions from coal mining, processing, storage and transport - emissions do not occur within the city.
• Subsector I.3.b Maritime transport - emissions do not occur within the city.

Subsector IV.2 Product use - emissions not estimated - not required for BASIC reporting.

The Municipality of Wroclaw reports emissions according to the GPC standard at the BASIC level, meeting the requirements of the Covenant of Mayors Compact of Mayors and the Global Covenant for Climate and Energy. Currently, the GHG inventories contain all the required data for BASIC reporting and most of the data needed at the BASIC+ level (BASIC+ reporting will be possible after making the necessary additions and changes to the inventory).

## Emission factors

Fixed emission factors have been used for all fuels - consistent with the inventory made for 2013 (based on the Methodology for developing the Low-Emission Economy Plan for Integrated Territorial Investments of the Wroclaw Functional Area). The emission factors for electricity and district heating are variable over the years. This is due to changes in production technology (fuels used and generation efficiency). Therefore, for electricity and heat, year-specific factors have been applied.

## Electricity

For the calculation of 2013 emissions, the official national emission factor defined by the National Centre for Emissions Management (KOBiZE) as carbon dioxide emissions per MWh of electricity produced in power plants and combined heat and power plants in 2013 was adopted. This factor is 831.50 kg CO₂/MWh⁸.

⁸ http://www.kobize.pl/pl/article/2014/id/569/komunikat-dotyczacy-emisji-dwutlenku-wegla-przypadajacej-na-1-mwh-energii-elektrycznej
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Starting in 2016, KOBIZE publishes⁹ product indicators for emissions of individual pollutants per unit of electricity production. For the emission inventory for 2014-2019, the relevant emission factor for that year (the most recent) was used. For 2022, the emission factor for 2021 was adopted (more recent data was not available at the time of preparation).

CH₄ and N₂O emission factors were assumed to be constant and invariant over time.

Table 2. Emission factors for electricity used in the GHG inventory.

|  Inventory year | Emission factor used [kg CO₂ /MWh]. | Reference year of the emission factor | Comments  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  1990 | 1,100,000 | 1990 | takes into account distribution losses  |
|  2013 | 831,500 | 2013 | takes into account distribution losses  |
|  2014 | 825,412 | 2014 | takes into account distribution losses  |
|  2015 | 798,000 | 2015 | takes into account distribution losses  |
|  2016 | 781,000 | 2016 | takes into account distribution losses  |
|  2017 | 781,000 | 2017 | takes into account distribution losses  |
|  2018 | 765,000 | 2018 | takes into account distribution losses  |
|  2019 | 719,000 | 2019 | takes into account distribution losses  |
|  2020 | 719,000 | 2020 | takes into account distribution losses  |
|  2021 | 698,000 | 2021 | takes into account distribution losses  |
|  2022 | 709,000 | 2022 | takes into account distribution losses  |

The increase in the value of the emission factor for electricity end-users for 2021 is due to the increase in electricity production in the country. According to information provided by KOBIZE, there was an increased demand for electricity in 2021 compared to 2020 (total consumption increased from 171.310 TWh in 2020 to 180.519 TWh in 2021) as a result of the recovery of economic activity after the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, reduced imports and increased exports of electricity. The percentage increase in CO₂ was greater than the increase in electricity generation due to, inter alia, weather-limited production from RES and reduced generation from gas-fired sources due to high gas prices and the consequent lower economic competitiveness of these units.¹⁰

## District heating

The emission factor for district heating (heat supplied by a district heating network) is calculated as the weighted average emission factor for all major sources supplying heat to the district heating system. For installations covered by the emissions trading scheme, the emission factor is obtained from the operators of the installation - in this case it is already calculated for the heat produced in the installation (possibly including cogeneration).

Waste management

Emission factors for the management of solid (mixed) waste have been updated on the basis of the latest reports from the National Emission Inventories. Emission factors for biological treatment of waste in line with the National Inventory have been added.

Table 4. Emission factors for waste management used in the GHG inventory.

Fugitive emissions from natural gas distribution systems

Updated emission factors were used, distinguishing between the natural gas distribution network and the transmission network. The indicators were taken from the study "Inventory of methane emissions from the natural gas distribution system" (Oil and Gas Institute)¹¹. The arithmetic average indicators presented in approach 3 were used: emission factor of the transmission network - 191 m³/km/year, emission factor of the distribution network - 81 m³/km/year.

Due to the fact that some of the basic data used in the emission inventory is made available with a considerable delay in relation to the year to which the data relates (statistical data from the Statistics
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Poland, data from the Marshal's Office for the use of the environment), the emission inventory was prepared partly on the basis of historical data (data from previous years).

At the date of completion of the emissions inventory (31 May 2023), the following data for 2022 was not available:

complete data on entities using the environment in the city - information on the type and quantity of fuels burned (Marshal's Office of Lower Silesia data),
statistics of the Statistics Poland (complete housing data),
Office of Rail Transport data,
emissions from civil aviation - national greenhouse gas emissions inventory,
emission factor for the national electricity grid for the year 2022.

The estimated error due to the use of incomplete/historical data is set at approximately  $+/- 5\%$  of the total emissions from the city area.

During the period 1990 - 2022, the volume of emissions from the Wroclaw Municipality area has changed significantly. The energy-intensive socialist economy, the effects of which can be seen in the volume and structure of emission sources for 1990, was replaced by a modern, increasingly efficient market economy. There was a significant decrease in emissions between 1990 and 2014, followed by a significant upward trend continuing until 2020. 2020 proved to be an exceptional year - with a significant drop in emissions most likely due to the economic and movement restrictions put in place related to the COVID-19 pandemic - with emissions decreasing by more than  $17\%$  in that year compared to 2019. In 2021, the economy the economy recovered from pandemic lockdowns and emissions started to increase again, and 2022 was
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

marked by a further increase in emissions compared to previous years, related to both the 'rebound' effect of the economy after the pandemic and the effects of the armed conflict in Ukraine.

## Total emissions

Based on the results of the inventory, it should be noted that the initially high emissions in the base year (1990 - more than 4.82 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) reached their first minimum in 2014 (just over 4.16 million tonnes), only to start rising again - by 2019, when emissions reached around 4.91 million tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ e, which is $1.8\%$ higher than the base year. In 2020, there was a sharp turnaround in this trend and emissions decreased significantly to around 4.1 million tonnes $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ e - the lowest level since 1990, which should be attributed primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, emissions increased again, but have not yet reached pre-pandemic levels, and 2022 continued the trend of increasing emissions (4.744 million tonnes $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ e). Currently, there are 7.04 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ e per city resident.

The changes in emissions shown have their origin in several main causes:

The emission inventory is carried out in actual values, without correction for fuel consumption and heat consumption related to the variability of the heating season
After the political transformation, especially since Poland's accession to the European Union, the city has been developing intensively, which translates into increasing energy consumption (mainly electricity and transport fuels) and rising emissions in the tertiary, industrial and transport sectors.
In 2020 and also, to a lesser extent in 2021, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emissions became apparent.
In 2022, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict had a significant impact on the volume of emissions, with a very large number of refugees from Ukraine arriving in the city (estimated at up to 150,000 people in 2022).

Since 1990, emissions from the industrial sector have been significantly reduced (by more than half from an initial share of less than $30\%$ to around $12.5\%$ today - an observed decreasing share in recent years) and waste management (from a share of around $11\%$ to less than $0.5\%$). Emissions from the transport sector have increased significantly since then (a steady upward trend since 2013) from initially less than $12\%$ share (1990) to more than $\%$ of the share in 2019, and in 2020 there was a significant decrease in emissions to $24.8\%$, but in 2021-2022 there was a rebound and it is now as high as $34.9\%$. In the buildings and facilities sector, emissions have remained more or less constant (in 2022, these emissions accounted for more than $52\%$ of total emissions, with a decreasing trend in these sectors' share of total emissions until 2022).

The agriculture, forestry and land use sector shows no significant change in emissions, and is also characterised by a small share - absorption of emissions predominates (GHG emissions predominated in the base year).

# Analysis of emissions by sector

Energy use in buildings and equipment (including industry)

Within the subsector, services, trade and institutions stand out in particular - this subsector has shown a consistently strong upward trend, halted in 2020 by the pandemic. In 2021, there was a rebound in this subsector, while emissions are now lower than in 2019, which can be linked to an increase in the number of people working remotely. The general upward trend, halted in 2020, is related to the economic development of the city and the construction of many new office, retail and service areas (new buildings) in recent years. The use of electricity and also district heating in these buildings, which is dependent on climatic conditions, is mainly responsible for the changes in emissions in this case.

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

In the residential sub-sector, a downward trend in emissions was evident until 2021 (a decrease of more than 18.8% compared to the base year), which was mainly due to an increase in the energy efficiency of buildings (especially thermal modernisation of multi-family buildings by housing communities and cooperatives), as well as a significant reduction in the use of coal for heating (in favour of low-carbon gas and district heating). Emissions from this subsector show a strong dependence on the number of heating degree days - in years with cold winters, emissions increase significantly - this is the reason for the increase in emissions in 2021 (more than 400 heating degree days more than in 2020).

In 2022, emissions decreased compared to 2021, due to a warmer winter and a shorter heating season (according to heat distributors). Interestingly, despite the very large number of refugees from Ukraine who stayed in Wroclaw (according to various estimates, it was between 100,000 and 150,000 people), this did not translate into significantly increased consumption of electricity and gas and other fuels, as opposed to water and waste volumes. The reception of refugees has indeed affected the entire economy of the city¹².

The residential sub-sector accounts for the second largest share of total emissions from the Wroclaw area (over 29% in 2022).

The tertiary sector shows similar changes to the residential sector - an increase in emissions until 2019, followed by a significant decrease due to the pandemic in 2020. In 2021, emissions in this sector 'rebounded', but did not reach pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, there was a decrease in emissions from the previous year. The tertiary sector currently accounts for around 22.6% of emissions from the city area.

The industry sub-sector has undergone significant changes due to the political transition of the 1990s, resulting in a reduction in emissions of over 59% in 2022 compared to the base year. Emissions in this subsector had a significant upward trend between 2018 and 2019, related to the city's continued economic development, now emissions have decreased significantly between 2020 and 2022.

## Transport

Within the transport sector, the main driver of emissions growth is road and air transport. The increase in GHG emissions for road transport was up to over 157% by 2019 compared to the base year. Due to the movement restrictions introduced in 2020, emissions decreased significantly and amounted to 109% compared to the base year. In the period 2021 – 2022, there was a rebound and emissions increased to 212% of the base year level. This is now the first largest share of total emissions of the emission inventory sub-sector (30% share in 2022).

In the case of road transport, this is associated with a steady increase in the number of cars and their use within Wroclaw - it should be noted that this is a nationwide trend. In the period 1990 - 2022, the number of vehicles registered in Wroclaw increased by more than 485% from approximately 145,000 in 1990 to 704,000 in 2022. The increased number of vehicles and traffic is also related to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict (influx of refugees from Ukraine).

In 1990, emissions from air transport were practically non-existent (minimal number of domestic connections), whereas since the mid-1990s, airport and air traffic development has taken place - particularly intense in the last few years, which translates into increased emissions. 2020 was a special year, air traffic was virtually halted - year-on-year emissions were reduced by 97%. The resumption of flights in 2021 resulted in a slight increase in aviation emissions again, and in 2022 the already normally operating airline contributed to a significant increase in emissions, which now account for around 3.4% of total emissions.

Emissions from rail transport are small (around 60,000 tonnes in 2022) and show a steady downward trend, mainly related to the decarbonisation of electricity. The number of rail connections shows an increasing trend.

Figure 6. Changes in transport emissions in Wroclaw from 1990 to 2022.

# Waste management

Between 1990 and 2022, there have been very significant changes to the waste management system - old landfills characterised by high methane emissions have been closed, and the currently operating landfills are equipped with landfill gas capture systems (biogas recovery), which significantly reduces methane emissions to the atmosphere. In addition, the amount of waste landfilled each year (due to recycling and other recovery processes) has been very significantly reduced. This has resulted in a reduction in the volume of emissions from over 390,000 tonnes to approximately 24,600 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  at present (a reduction of over  $93\%$ ).

It should be noted that composting of biodegradable waste has been introduced, which influences the appearance of additional  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  and  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  emissions in this sector - emissions from composting account for more than 3/4 of emissions from waste management. The waste management sector has had relatively constant emissions since 2013. The slight increase in emissions in recent years is related to the increasing amount of municipal wastewater being treated. In 2022, emissions have increased due to more waste generated in Wroclaw and managed within and outside the city limits.

# Agriculture, forestry and land use

The AFOLU sector currently contributes to reducing the volume of total emissions from the Wroclaw area, thanks to the absorption of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  by green areas. The magnitude of the uptake remains relatively constant (increasing with the increase in green areas – particularly in forest areas). The significantly higher emissions from the sector in 1990 were due to the higher number of livestock in the city and the more intensive fertilisation of soils. Although woodland is increasing, the built-up area is increasing, which in total reduces the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  absorption capacity. The reduction in emissions is mainly due to fewer livestock within the city.

# Analysis of emissions by energy carrier used

Among the energy carriers used in Wroclaw, electricity has the highest consumption and the highest GHG emissions, accounting for more than  $37.5\%$  of emissions in 2022 (indirect emissions of more than 1,775 million tonnes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ ). The share of this energy carrier has increased since 1990 ( $35.7\%$  in 1990). The increase in electricity consumption is primarily related to economic development - the increasing number of retail, service and office spaces is the main driver of growth in this case. The increase in emissions is evident even despite the increasing decarbonisation of electricity from the national energy system. However, exceptionally, electricity emissions has increased slightly in 2021.

For indirect emissions resulting from district heating, a significant increase in energy efficiency is evident. The share of heat in the volume of emissions has decreased from an initial almost  $30\%$  (1990) to about  $17.7\%$  today. The increase in heat consumption (and GHG emissions) in recent years compared to previous years is mainly due to the longer heating season (2016 and 2017, 2021), but also in part to an increase in sales related to the connection of new heat consumers.

Natural gas consumption shows a slight upward trend, reinforced in 2022, which translates into a slight increase in emissions from this fuel in recent years. This is related to the increase in the use of this fuel for home heating in recent years (as a result of the replacement of old coal-fired cookers and boilers). In 1990, natural gas was mainly used in industry and in homes for hot water, after 1990 there was a very rapid increase in the use of this fuel for domestic heating purposes.

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)
Figure 9. Changes in emissions from the use of the main energy carriers used for economic and domestic purposes in Wroclaw between 1990 and 2022.

The consumption of hard coal (especially in housing) has been on a steady downward trend, linked to the now widespread reduction in its use for heating purposes (due to the need to reduce air emissions). After 1990, there has been a very large decline in coal consumption - from almost  $18\%$  of the GHG emission volume to less than  $1\%$  today. Coal used for heating is mainly replaced by district heating and natural gas.

Other fuels (fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas) account for a small share of total emissions and do not show much variability, although their consumption has been increasing in recent years.

For transport fuels, emissions from each fuel show a very strong upward trend, halted in 2020 by the introduced movement restrictions. Very significant is the increase in the use of petrol and diesel, which, despite being less carbon-intensive in terms of greenhouse gases, contributes much more to air pollution from particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides than motor gasoline. In 2021 - 2022, there was a significant 'rebound' in post-pandemic transport fuel consumption.

# Summary

The main conclusions from the analysis of the emission inventories carried out so far are as follows:

Total GHG emissions in 2022 amounted to 4,744,022 Mg CO $_2$ e and were 79,863 Mg CO $_2$ e lower (1.66%) than the base year emissions estimated at 4,823,885 Mg CO $_2$ e (1990)
There was a very large decrease in emissions between 1990 and 2014 (13.7%), with a slow increase in emissions since 2015. In 2020, this trend came to a sharp halt due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly evident in the industrial, services and transport subsectors. In 2021, the economy 'rebounded' and emissions started to increase again, but declined slightly in 2022
In 2022, the key driver of emissions growth in the city was the transport sector, which increased its share at the expense of other sectors
The main driver of the increase in GHG emissions in Wroclaw is transport - in order to achieve significant emission reductions (assumed in the Low-Emission Economy Plan for Integrated Territorial Investments of the Wroclaw Functional Area), it is necessary to implement measures leading to a reduction in the use of individual motor vehicles to move around the city. The travel restrictions introduced in 2020 resulted in a significant decrease in transport emissions (16% year-on-year decrease, compared to 2019), but already in 2021 and 2022 transport emissions started to increase rapidly again (this is also related to the influx of refugees)
Electricity consumption shows a constant, high growth trend, which, despite the steady declining emissivity of electricity in Poland, is, after transport, the second most important factor in the growth of emissions in Wroclaw. However, this is inextricably linked to the economic development of the city
Coal consumption has been steadily decreasing in recent years, which is mainly related to the implementation of air protection policies (e.g. implementation of Kawka programmes) and the city's progressive district heating
There has been a very large decrease in emissions from the waste management sector, which is linked to the implementation of modern waste management methods - a significant reduction in landfill and the introduction of landfill gas recovery. The use of composting has slightly increased emissions in this sector
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

After 1990, air transport emissions, which were previously negligible and not included in the baseline inventory, occurred in the Wroclaw area. Air transport emissions show a strong upward trend (an increase of more than 87% in 6 years). These emissions were almost completely reduced in 2020 (down 97% year-on-year, compared to 2019) and started to return to their former level in 2021 - 2022.

Between 2018 and 2019, an intense increase in emissions from the industrial sector was marked, with an increase of more than 160,000 tonnes in 2 years (from 2016). In contrast, emissions from industry decreased in 2020, probably as a result of COVID-19. Currently, these emissions continue their downward trend.

The development of emission inventories is a process that is subject to continuous change and improvement. When data is obtained that allows emissions to be estimated with greater accuracy, it should be used to revise and update historical emissions inventories. Listed below are the inventory elements that should be subject to more detailed analysis and verification when successive emission inventories are carried out, ranked in order of relevance:

Back-testing of the emission inventories for 1990 and 2013 - 2021, based on the most up-to-date data available (the Statistics Poland, national emission inventories, other available data sources).
Application of the emission factor for electricity for 2022 (published at the end of 2023).
Analyse the appropriateness of developing a new model for estimating emissions from the residential sector - fuels used for home heating. The model could be developed using data from the Central Building Emissions Inventory. Data continuity may be problematic - verification of how significant the change is needed.
Analyse the methodology for estimating road transport emissions - the currently adopted methodology and parameters are likely to overestimate emissions from the transport sector. In particular, attention should be paid to the parameters for the number of kilometres travelled within the city.
Update passenger rolling stock data (emission estimates are based on 2015 model and assumptions).
Verify the feasibility of including rail freight in the emissions inventory (subject to data availability).
Analyse the appropriateness of updating the emission factors for fuels (according to the most up-to-date KOBIZE reports). In addition, analyse the rationale for dividing coal into two types.
Prepare a model for estimating emissions for water and wastewater management taking into account local specificities.
Transfer and update the emission factors in the AFOLU sector.
Relocate and update the method for determining emissions from industrial processes (IPPU sector).
Re-analysis of data for river transport - to determine whether emissions are increasing compared to the 2016 analysis.

In addition, the Municipality of Wroclaw currently reports emissions at the BASIC level in accordance with the GPC guidelines. The high level of detail in the inventory and the availability of source data make it possible to move to the BASIC+ reporting level. Achieving the BASIC+ reporting level requires:

Complementing the emission estimate for Subsector IV.2 Emissions from product use - a method for estimating emissions for this subsector should be developed
Changing the model for determining transport emissions - identifying/extracting emissions resulting from residents' travel outside the city's borders
Analysis of other sources in Subsector V.3
Inclusion of landfill biogas combustion in biogenic emissions.

To conclude the information, it is worth mentioning that as part of the inventory, in addition to the GPC standards, emissions for the SEAP/SECAP were also calculated. In this case, this value is lower than the GPC emissions and for the Low-Emission Economy Plan for Integrated Territorial Investments of the Wroclaw Functional Area, lower by 171,712 t CO₂ as it does not take into account emissions from air transport and the gas distribution system. In this view, the volume of GHG emissions in 2022 was - 4,572,308

t CO₂. Therefore, in the following part of the CCC when the emission gap and the actions in the action plan are described, reference is made to the value of emissions counted according to SECAP rules.

## Greenhouse gas emissions based on an economic model (2024)

The economic model considers 13 sectors and sub-sectors related to greenhouse gas emissions. These are: transport (reduced demand for passenger transport, increased use of shared transport, reduction and optimisation of freight logistics, shift to public and non-motorised transport, electrification of cars, buses and freight), buildings and heating (new buildings with high energy efficiency, energy-efficient building renovation, energy-efficient lighting and appliances, decarbonisation of heating), electricity (shift to renewable energy sources), waste (increase in recycling). The model does not include actions related to the AFOLU sector as it does not significantly affect emissions reductions.

The economic model calculates the cost and carbon impact of the measures and identifies which measures in the plan provide the greatest benefit in terms of carbon dioxide emission reductions relative to the financial outlay. The model gives a social cost-benefit perspective (not restricted to city boundaries), delta OPEX and net CAPEX, and quantifies financial costs/benefits, air quality, noise and road safety.

The model includes scope 1 and 2 emissions in the economic case, as cities can often affect these emission sources. Scope 3 emissions are only included for municipal waste disposed of outside the city boundaries. This is consistent with the methodology adopted in the inventory and with the requirements of the Cities Mission.

Based on the data entered into the model, emissions were estimated for the so-called base year 2019 (it is worth noting, however, that the data in the model are not from a single period, but are rather a collection of different data from the last few years - depending on their availability). The baseline emissions estimated in this way are higher than those estimated in the inventory for both 2019 and 2022. The difference is 2.4% for 2019 and 5.9% for 2022. This implies a relatively high convergence of the results obtained.

The economic model with regard to the emission structure also shows the dominance of emissions from the buildings sector only in this view it is broken down into two components - emissions from electricity production and from its use and heat in buildings (in the case of the inventory, emissions from buildings are calculated together with emissions from electricity and heat production). In both cases it is respectively 55% according to the inventory and 58% according to the model. The second important area is transport (both in the inventory and in the model at 31%). The last sector of importance in reducing emissions is industry.

Based on the data, the model also forecasts future emissions from the city area in a continuation or business-as-usual scenario for the year 2030. According to these data, emissions could increase by almost 7%, with electricity generation being the main growth sector, while decreases could be recorded in transport and energy and heat consumption in buildings.

The model then presents a scenario for reducing greenhouse gas emissions under certain assumptions made by the city. These assumptions should provide a scenario showing how far the city can go in its decarbonisation efforts in a very ambitious scenario, consistent with the SECAP. The values in the table below were used for the analysis. These figures show what changes in each sector would need to be undertaken to achieve a reduction in GHG emissions of at least 80% compared to 2030 emissions calculated under the BAU scenario.

The economic model, based on inputted contemporary data from recent years, forecasts emissions in 2030 according to the so-called BAU scenario. Therefore, the emission reductions in this case do not relate to a reduction in values relative to a base year as close as possible to the present day and the values obtained from the emission inventories held, but relate to estimated emissions in 2030. In the case of Wroclaw, this estimate of emissions in 2030 will be higher than the emissions from the adopted base year 2022 by 909,862 t CO $_2$ e, i.e. by approximately  $16\%$ . According to the economic model, emissions in 2019 were 5,036,733 t CO $_2$ e i.e. higher than those from the GHG inventory by 455,595 t CO $_2$ e (9%). According to the economic model, the total emission reduction will be 4,399,000 t CO $_2$ e and the residual emissions will remain at 1,092,000 t CO $_2$ e.

Residual emissions consist of those emissions which can't be reduced through climate action and are being offset. Residual emissions may amount to a maximum of 20% as stated by the Mission Info Kit.
Emissions reduction target percentage for "Other" sector is assumed to be the same as for the other 4 main sectors unless updated by city. Activities and commitments to reduce these emissions are documented in the Climate Neutrality Action Plan.

It is worth noting that in building the portfolio of actions towards emission reductions in the Action Plan, the actions indicated in the sectors included in the model were used, but referred directly to emission reductions from the baseline year 2022 based on the emission inventory. The emissions gap was also calculated for the base year inventory values (presented later in the CCC).

The use of an economic model allowed us to confirm the assumption that in order to successfully achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, external stakeholders need to be involved, as the municipality is responsible for only a small fraction of city-wide emissions. The model estimates this to be around 4% of direct emissions and another few percent as a manager of the transport infrastructure. On the basis of analyses for dozens of European cities that have used the economic model, this share of emissions directly dependent on the magistrate is assumed to be in the order of 7-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions from the city area.

## A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies

### Impact of policies and legislation on climate neutrality

Policies at both local and national level, as well as some regulations, have to some extent a decisive influence on the dynamics of emission reduction activities. Policies and regulations are the basis for the subsequent creation of detailed operational documents (plans, programmes) and support programmes from municipal, national and European funds. Policies and regulations allow targets to be clearly defined and can significantly accelerate their implementation, but they are no substitute for action.

A good example is the legislation regulating the installation of renewable energy sources on private buildings - when legislation was introduced to benefit prosumers, around 7 000 prosumers' installations were set up in Wroclaw in a short period of time, additionally supported by tax exemptions offered by the city. However, in the last year the regulations were changed to be less favourable for prosumers and this resulted in a slowdown in the creation of further installations. Obviously, these changes were aimed at protecting the stability of transmission networks unprepared for such a development of distributed sources, but this has had a negative impact on the growth of renewable energy capacity.

The situation is similar with aid programmes - as long as they are grant-based, they are willingly used by residents (sometimes overly complicated procedures or restrictive criteria for awarding grants can be a barrier). However, in the case of repayable instruments (such as loans, credits), interest decreases significantly. From the local government's point of view, the limitation is the regulations on budget discipline or public procurement law, which often restrict the possibility of quick investment activities.

At this stage, it seems that strategic and regulatory actions in the field of energy decarbonisation, but also in the field of energy efficiency of buildings, which will reduce significant energy consumption in buildings and thus also energy costs for residents, are crucial. In addition, regulations and policies and even sector-specific strategies are needed - heating, energy, mobility, building renovation. The policies and regulations at city, regional and national level outlined above partly respond to these challenges, but require bolder targets as well as consistent implementation and funding.

### Assessment of all level policies impacting Wroclaw's Climate Neutrality Ambition

Achieving climate neutrality by 2030 necessitates a comprehensive assessment of the impact and effectiveness of policies across all levels — local, regional, national, and European. These policies collectively focus on enhancing energy efficiency, promoting sustainable transport, transitioning to low-emission heating systems, and stimulating innovation in low-carbon technologies. By incentivising change and ensuring policy integration and alignment, these policies aim to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the path to climate neutrality is fraught with challenges that require continuous adaptation and long-term investment.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Furthermore, actions at the local level must be supported by regulations at the national and regional level that enable the implementation of energy efficiency of buildings (Building Act), facilitate investment in renewable energy sources (RES Act and policy documents), provide incentives for rapid energy decarbonisation (Energy Act and other energy regulations), contribute to the development of sustainable transport and support the NBS (Spatial Planning Law and other regulations).

## Impact and Effectiveness

Expected Emission Reductions: Collectively, all level policies are expected to lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The focus on energy efficiency improvements in buildings, promotion of sustainable transport modes, and transition to low-emission heating systems will contribute to achieving emission reduction targets.
Incentivising Change: Financial incentives and subsidies for energy-efficient technologies and low-emission heating systems encourage residents and businesses to adopt sustainable practices. This approach facilitates behavioural change and accelerates the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Stimulating Innovation: EU policies stimulate innovation and investment in low-carbon technologies and practices through funding mechanisms and regulatory incentives. This approach accelerates the transition to a sustainable and resilient economy while enhancing competitiveness and job creation.

## Integration and Alignment

Policy Integration: EU policies are aligned with international climate agreements such as the Paris Agreement, ensuring coherence and global leadership in climate action. They provide a harmonised framework that enables member states to collaborate effectively and share best practices in achieving climate neutrality. All level policies are well-integrated into Wroclaw's overall urban development and sustainability strategies. They align with national and EU-level climate targets, ensuring coherence and synergy in climate action efforts.
Monitoring and Adaptation: Continuous monitoring and evaluation of policy effectiveness are crucial. Regular reviews allow for adjustments based on evolving technologies, economic conditions, and emerging environmental challenges.

## Challenges and Considerations

Implementation Challenges: Implementation of all level policies may face challenges such as funding constraints, regulatory complexities, and public acceptance. Addressing these challenges will require collaboration with stakeholders and effective communication of benefits.
Long-Term Sustainability: Ensuring the long-term sustainability of emission reductions will require ongoing investment in renewable energy infrastructure, technology innovation, and capacity building.

## Summary

In summary, the policies at all levels are crucial for steering Wroclaw towards its 2030 climate neutrality ambition. They are expected to drive substantial emission reductions through energy efficiency improvements, sustainable transport initiatives, and the adoption of low-emission technologies. Financial incentives and subsidies play a key role in facilitating this transition, while EU policies stimulate innovation and investment. Ensuring the alignment of these policies with international climate goals provides coherence and strengthens the collective effort. Despite the challenges in implementation and the need for sustained investment, these policies form a robust framework for Wroclaw to achieve its climate goals and contribute to a sustainable and resilient future.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

A-2.3: Emissions gap

Achieving climate neutrality by 2030 requires a meticulous assessment of current emissions reduction efforts and the identification of additional measures necessary to bridge the emissions gap. In the context of Wroclaw, this gap refers to the difference between the city's current trajectory of emissions reductions outlined in its Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) and the level of reductions needed to meet the ambitious climate neutrality target.

## Importance of Quantifying the Emissions Gap

Quantifying the emissions gap is crucial for several reasons:

Strategic Planning: It provides a clear understanding of how far Wroclaw is from achieving climate neutrality by 2030 and guides the development of targeted strategies and policies.
Resource Allocation: Helps prioritise investments and allocate resources effectively towards high-impact mitigation actions.
Policy Alignment: Ensures that new measures proposed in the Action Plan are aligned with the specific emissions reduction goals needed to close the gap.

## SECAP as a Baseline

The SECAP serves as a foundational document outlining Wroclaw's current efforts and commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It includes measures across sectors such as energy, transport, buildings, and waste management, aiming to achieve substantial reductions by 2030. The current SECAP sets the following reduction levels: by 20% by 2020, by 40% by 2030 and by 80% by 2050. However, the actions included in this programme only apply to the time horizon up to 2030. The actions planned in the SECAP should result in greenhouse gas reductions of 21% compared to the base year (in the SECAP it was 1990 - for the Action Plan it was 2022 - fortunately these values are not significantly different). However, to achieve climate neutrality, additional actions beyond those outlined in the SECAP may be required. This is all the more so because, as the emission inventories indicate, the first of the targets, a 20% reduction in 2020 compared to the base year (1990), has not been achieved.

## Addressing the Emissions Gap in the Action Plan

The forthcoming Action Plan for Wroclaw will outline specific actions and policies designed to bridge the emissions gap identified through quantitative analysis. These actions will build upon existing initiatives while introducing new measures to accelerate emission reductions across the city.

The table below shows the calculation of the emissions gap taking into account the measures from SECAP. Due to the different mix of measures in SECAP, reductions from heat and power production have been added to the buildings sector in the table as this is where they are mainly consumed. The actions identified in the SECAP are dominated by reductions related to the buildings sector and heat and power production. It covers very little of the reductions from the transport or industry sectors, and does not address waste and water and wastewater management measures at all.

Of course, some of the actions in the SECAP are long term and will therefore also be part of the current action plan. It has been assumed that the actions in the action plan are counted separately from the actions from the SECAP, therefore only the reductions resulting from the action plan will be included in column 5, and together with the reductions from the existing SECAP will give the expected result of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent from the base year 2022.

In the case of emission reductions for the 2022 base year (based on the inventory), the total emission reduction should be 3,664,911 t CO2e and the residual emissions will remain at 916,228 t CO2e. In

contrast, the Climate Contract Action Plan should include emission reductions of at least 2,716,043 t CO2e to achieve the assumed reduction rate of 80% relative to the base year. In showing the emissions gap, it was assumed that the emission reductions would be distributed evenly for each sector. However, the following section shows some deviations from this assumption due to the possible interventions in each sector and their reduction potential.

Quantifying the emissions gap between current efforts outlined in the SECAP and the required reductions for climate neutrality provides a roadmap for strategic climate action planning in Wroclaw. By identifying and addressing this gap through targeted policies and investments, Wroclaw can progress towards its ambitious climate goals and contribute to global efforts in combating climate change.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The table shows the emissions in the base year 2022, the reduction target set in the Mission, i.e. an 80% reduction in CO2e emissions, the emissions on the basis of the existing SECAP, the emissions remaining to be reduced under the AP and the residual emissions, i.e. 20%. Column 4 shows the emissions by sector that should be reduced as a result of the actions proposed in the Action Plan. The actual, estimated values of emission reductions by sector in relation to the identified emissions gap are given in the table on page 91-92 in module 3.1 presenting the actions planned to be carried out.

# Residual emissions

With respect to residual greenhouse gas emissions, a value of  $20\%$  was assumed due to the relatively short time for potential investments and the relatively high level of baseline emissions. Unfortunately, the challenge faced by Wroclaw is significantly greater than in some of the mission cities, which is largely due to national conditions (energy mix), but also the state of the building stock in the city area (very high proportion of old buildings), or the way individual buildings are supplied with heat (ongoing process of replacing coal-fired heat sources). Simulations carried out using an economic model indicate that a key action to achieve climate neutrality is to change the way electricity and heat are produced (switching to renewable sources as much as possible). As this is mainly dependent on state-owned companies, action in this regard concerns the national level and ambitious decarbonisation plans at government level. For the time being, national plans indicate a  $50\%$  share of renewables in electricity generation and  $32\%$  in heat generation. These values are insufficient to achieve more ambitious reduction targets than  $80\%$ .

# Emission gap based on an economic model

As part of our work on the climate contract, we also used an economic model to calculate the emissions gap using the BAU2030 scenario. The economic model, based on the inputted contemporary data from recent years and current emission factors (the data used in the model calculation can be found in Table 10), forecasts the emissions in 2030 according to the so-called BAU scenario. Therefore, the emission reductions shown in this case do not relate to a reduction in values from the base year, as close as possible to the present time and the values obtained from the available emission inventories, but relate to estimated emissions in 2030. In the case of Wroclaw, this estimated emission in 2030, according to the BAU scenario, will be higher than the emissions from the adopted base year by 909 862 t CO $_2$ e, i.e. by approximately  $16\%$ . According to the economic model, emissions in 2019 were 5,036,733 t CO $_2$ e i.e. higher than those from the GHG emissions inventory by 455,595 t CO $_2$ e (9%). According to the economic model, the total emission reduction should be 4,399,000 t CO $_2$ e, with residual emissions of 1,092,000 t CO $_2$ e.

The economic model indicates differentiated emission reductions across sectors, in particular high potential for emission reductions in the building and heating sector and electricity generation. Lower reductions are achievable in the transport and utilities sectors. It is worth noting that such significant reductions will be possible with the assumption that as much as 80% of electricity will come from renewable sources. This is significantly higher than the current plans contained in national documents (mainly the National Energy and Climate Plan to 2030 (In 2019 update of the Plan) - draft of 29.02.2024 - sent to the European Commission in March).

# 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

# A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

Based on the inventory, it can be clearly stated that Decarbonisation of electricity and heat production for buildings and transport will be crucial for the city's climate transformation. These two main sectors (buildings/stationary energy and transport) generate over 86.5% of emissions. To achieve significant reductions, efforts must be focused on these areas. Both in the case of Decarbonisation of the construction and energy production sectors, as well as in the transport sector, actions must go at least in two directions.

Firstly, and most importantly, the method of producing electricity and heat to power buildings and transport must change. So far, the main factor of energy production, both in the national energy system and locally, are fossil fuels with high emission parameters, therefore investment activities must be aimed at the gradual elimination of fossil fuels, first of all, switching to less emission ones, and ultimately to renewable or emission-free ones. Support for renewable energy sources is also necessary in this sector. This means encouraging entrepreneurs and residents to invest in renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic panels or wind turbines, which will help reduce emissions related to energy production at the local level.

The second important element of this process is reducing energy consumption. In the case of construction, this will concern thermal modernisation of the building fabric in order to reduce the demand for energy, especially heat. This is also particularly important in the context of reducing energy poverty. Changes in the heating and electricity production sectors result in an increase in energy prices, which translates directly into the quality of life of residents. The vast majority of the city's housing requires renovation in terms of thermal modernisation, both in municipal and private resources, as well as in relation to public buildings. Investing in projects to improve the energy efficiency of public and private buildings can deliver significant benefits in terms of both emissions reductions and maintenance cost savings.

In the case of the transport sector, the transition to electric vehicles will involve an increase in demand for electricity or energy produced from emission-free sources (e.g. hydrogen cells). This means a potential increase in emissions if it is largely produced using fossil fuels. Therefore, the development of electromobility and its positive impact on emission reductions in Wroclaw will only be possible if the energy mix changes at the national level, supported by the development of renewable sources at the local or even individual level (electric cars as energy storage for individual photovoltaics). Again, this must be linked to an increase in the share of non-vehicular transport so as to reduce this demand. The best effects in terms of emission reduction are achieved by changing the modal split to one where the share of individual transport is significantly reduced in favor of public transport. That is why the city has been taking steps to develop and promote public transport for years. Due to the significant
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

share of transport in emissions, investments are and will be continued in the expansion and modernisation of public transport, promoting its use and limiting individual car transport.

An important element of the energy transformation is education and involvement of local communities. This involves building awareness among residents about the importance of reducing emissions and how they can get involved. This may turn out to be crucial for the success of the activities, because, as analyzes show, private owners are mostly responsible for reducing emissions. Administrative action alone at the national, local and city levels will not be enough. Cooperation with external partners, such as non-governmental organisations, academic institutions or enterprises, can contribute to the exchange of knowledge and experiences and joint implementation of projects.

Stakeholder involvement should also apply to the entrepreneurial sector, therefore it is necessary to introduce incentive programmes for enterprises that invest in environmentally friendly technologies, which can accelerate the transformation of the industrial sector. Wroclaw is a large academic center, but also a smart up center, so it has the potential to be a leader in new Decarbonisation technologies. It is worth mentioning that Saule Technologies is a company based in Wroclaw that produces highly efficient photovoltaic cells made of perovskites.

Stakeholders are a broad and diverse group due to their power of influence and willingness to be directly involved in energy transition activities. Collaboration with stakeholders was built within the Transition Team. The stakeholder selection process focused on six main topics with the greatest impact on emissions:

spatial development and sustainable building;
energy (including hydrogen) and energy efficiency;
closed loop economy;
sustainable transport;
blue-green infrastructure;
social inclusion and education.

The work on the CCC, as well as its subsequent implementation, involves continuous monitoring of progress and updating of actions. Regular stocktaking and monitoring of progress towards targets will allow actions to be adjusted in response to changing circumstances.

## Main barriers and gaps identified in the city:

High costs and unknown scale of needs related to increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. The vast majority of emissions from the city arise from the production of energy (electricity and heat) and its consumption by buildings. According to the results of the latest GHG inventory (for 2022), in Wroclaw the dominant sector in terms of emissions is stationary energy (production of electricity and heat and its consumption by buildings), which constitutes 55% of the city's total emissions. According to current data for 2021, there are 360.2 thousand in Wroclaw. apartments with a total area of 21.2 million m², located in 52 thousand buildings (according to the 2021 National Census). The area of municipal buildings is approx. 1,560 thousand m². The average area of one apartment is 59 m². Residential buildings constitute over 66% of all buildings in the city. In terms of usable area, residential buildings built between 1918 and 1944 and buildings constructed between 1989 and 2002 dominate. Buildings from the first of the above-mentioned time periods often differ in their construction solutions regarding partitions and energy systems from today's standards. At the same time, some of the facilities are under conservation protection. Facilities constructed in later years, until 2002, constitute the largest group of buildings. At the same time, they are characterized by very different solutions and varying degrees of thermal modernisation. Non-residential buildings constitute approximately 33.4% of the total area of buildings in the city (approx. 10,660 thousand m² of usable area). The condition and energy characteristics of most of them are unknown. In Poland, the Integrated System for Reducing Low Emissions (ZONE) has recently been implemented, of which the Central Emissions Register for Buildings (CEEB) is a part, but it does not yet have enough data to estimate the scale of thermal modernisation needs for all buildings in the city. The greatest challenge to the climate transformation is posed by: buildings with unregulated ownership status, buildings in poor technical condition, buildings entered in the register of monuments or under conservation protection. Thermal modernisation of buildings is the key to achieving climate neutrality in Wroclaw. All available analyzes show that it is impossible to produce as much heat energy from renewable energy sources as is currently consumed by buildings in Wroclaw.

Actions to take:

a. completing data on buildings in the Integrated Low Emission Reduction System (ZONE),
b. conducting energy audits of buildings,

Society of Polish Town Planners

Society of Landscape Architects
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

c. launching (at the EU, national and local levels) systemic financial support programmes for deep thermal modernisation of buildings and an advisory system facilitating the use of the programmes and increasing their availability.

Dependence on the National Energy System (NES) and the national energy mix. The Wroclaw local government has very limited influence on energy generation sources, which are regulated at the national level. There are energy companies operating in the city that meet 53% of the city's demand for thermal energy, are independent from the city and are not obliged to consult their development plans with the local government. The energy and heating sector in Wroclaw is based on the production of electricity and heat from fossil fuels, coal and natural gas, and partially from biomass. However, the current national energy mix is based on fossil fuels. The main fuel is coal. For example, in 2022, 66.2% of domestic heat production came from coal, and almost 16% from other fossil fuels: natural gas and fuel oil (Energy Regulatory Office - report: Thermal energy in numbers - 2022).

Actions to take:

a. Decarbonisation and modernisation of the national energy system,

b. creating a local strategic partnership of the city with the main producers and suppliers of energy in the city in order to agree on joint Decarbonisation activities, including: increasing energy production from non-fossil sources (e.g. biogas), reducing energy losses on transmission networks and distribution lines, using waste energy (from industrial processes, refrigeration processes, sewage, server rooms), energy storage, increasing the sales offer of certified green energy, searching for new sources of energy supply.

Limited, direct impact on the level of greenhouse gas emissions in the city. The GHG inventory in Wroclaw shows that the share of municipal units in the emissions of the entire Wroclaw fluctuated around 10-12% (applies to emission ranges 1 and 2). This means that the vast majority of emissions are the responsibility of entities over which the local government has no direct influence.

Actions to take:

a. engaging the widest possible range of urban stakeholders in activities towards climate neutrality,

b. launching (at the national, EU and local level) a broad, attractive programme of incentives (subsidies, reliefs) for residents, entrepreneurs and other municipal entities encouraging activities aimed at reducing greenhouse gases in various sectors (energy efficiency of buildings, switching to renewable energy source sources, electromobility, etc.).

Systemic barriers to the development of renewable energy sources. The development of renewable energy sources in cities in Poland encounters many systemic barriers. These are formal and legal barriers such as: lack of stable legal regulations and long-term development strategy, which leads to investment uncertainty, the so-called "distance criterion" in the Act on investments in wind farms, which prevents the construction of windmills in densely built-up areas, the lack of legal possibilities to establish energy cooperatives in urban communes, unfavorable settlements for prosumers of electricity supplied to the National Energy System. There are also infrastructural barriers, such as restrictions for prosumers related to access to connection capacity due to the lack of appropriate infrastructure (especially in the field of transmission networks). These types of barriers discourage or even prevent investing in renewable energy. In the case of photovoltaics, they make production for self-consumption at the point of production the most profitable and it is

4
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

not profitable to produce surplus energy. In the case of wind energy, they prevent the construction of windmills in urban or suburban areas.

Actions to take:

a. legislative changes at the national level, including the reduction of the so-called "distance criterion" in the Act on investments in wind farms,

b. enabling the establishment of energy cooperatives in urban communes, a more favorable energy settlement system for prosumers,

c. creation, at the national level, of stable legal regulations and a long-term strategy for the development of renewable energy sources.

Financial barriers. Systemic transformation requires huge financial outlays that local governments cannot cover. Therefore, the most costly changes must be carried out using external funds: regional, central, EU, foreign and private. Access to current financing programmes is significantly limited by the scattering of financing programmes, complicated application procedure and rigid nature of the procedures, narrow scope of programmes (they are addressed to specific activities, comprehensive transformation activities require the use of many programmes with different application and settlement rules), lack of an appropriate number qualified staff at the Wroclaw Municipality who could process applications and implement projects, in particular statutory restrictions on local government debt, limiting the possibility of using loans.

Actions to take:

a. facilitating access to national and EU financing programmes by: simplifying application procedures, more comprehensive financing programmes and their modular structure enabling flexible use of various programme options, launching an advisory system supporting local governments in the process of obtaining and settling subsidies, adapting financing programmes to real needs and restrictions in EU member states.

b. increasing the level of private capital involvement in public investments in the city by using the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) formula, the Energy Service Company (ESCO) formula, or by establishing funds dedicated to activities related to energy transformation (e.g. related to renewable energy).

Unknown scale of energy poverty. The scale of the energy poverty phenomenon is not precisely known and its proper diagnosis is not easy. This action is still being analyzed. Without detailed knowledge of the nature and scale of the phenomenon, it will be difficult to create effective support programmes.

Key factors contributing to energy poverty are low energy efficiency in buildings, insufficient income to cover energy costs and rising energy prices. It is estimated that approximately 12% of the population in Poland is affected by this phenomenon. In Wroclaw, energy poverty is exacerbated by legal problems related to the ownership of real estate and the relatively high share of pre-war buildings, especially in the city center, which hamper significant investments in the modernisation of buildings.

Actions to take:

a. conducting a thorough analysis of the scale and specificity of the phenomenon of energy poverty in Wroclaw,

b. designing public policies (at national, regional and local levels) to alleviate energy poverty by improving the energy efficiency of buildings, promoting renewable energy

Plan

sources, developing energy communities and promoting decentralized and democratized energy production and consumption,

c. elimination of legal barriers at the national level limiting the development of energy communities,

d. developing programmes of targeted financial support for low-income households,

e. substantive support in obtaining financing, appropriate investment selection and adjustment of energy community models are adapted to local conditions.

Restrictions on the development of blue and green infrastructure (BGI). The city has great potential for BZI development, but is increasingly struggling with challenges such as: lack of places for new tree plantings (mainly due to conflicts with underground infrastructure), complicated land ownership structure (open areas, valuable in terms of nature, are often outside the city's property and are not protected against development), urbanization pressure from private investors on new areas, increasingly difficult habitat conditions for plants in the city (heat waves, droughts, frosts, emergence of new pests, diseases and invasive species), many entities responsible for maintaining urban green areas.

Actions to take:

a. legislative changes at the national level enabling local governments to more effectively protect valuable areas against urbanization pressure and introducing quality standards for investors regarding the development of the surroundings of linear and cubature investments (e.g. regarding the quality of biologically active surface or management of rainwater on the plot),

b. dissemination of uniform standards for the development and maintenance of green areas for all entities responsible for maintaining urban green areas (not only those managed by local governments, but also private and cooperative ones),

c. selection of plant species with increased resistance to high temperatures, droughts and other threats.

Problems with using rainwater. Only a small part of rainwater is reused in the city, which affects the city's degree of adaptation to climate change. This is due to factors such as: dispersion of responsibility for rainwater management among various entities (in particular for managing stormwater infrastructure), high degree of sealing of the area, especially in downtown districts, lack of legal regulations and a systemic solution that would allow investors to be obliged to use solutions ensuring stormwater retention and management in the investment area, with simultaneous strong investment and urbanisation pressure on almost all areas, low level of implementation of stormwater drainage solutions, lack of general standards for rainwater retention and management.

Actions to be taken:

a. implementation of legislation at national level obliging investors to use solutions ensuring the retention and management of rainwater or meltwater in the investment area;

b. intensification of actions aimed at sealing off areas of impermeable surface belonging to the city, but also encouraging private or cooperative investors to do so;

c. intensification of educational activities aimed at property owners, cooperatives, housing communities, entrepreneurs in the field of adaptation to climate change and management of rainwater.

d. intensifying efforts to break up urban impermeable areas, but also to encourage private investors or cooperatives to do so,

# 3 Part B – Pathways towards Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 3.1 Module B-1 Climate Neutrality Scenarios and Impact Pathways

### B-1.1: Impact Pathways

The choice of impact pathways is a direct result of the emission structure in Wroclaw. According to the GHG inventory, but also to the analyses within the economic model, it can be concluded that in Wroclaw the key actions are in 3 areas:

Production of electricity and heat
Renovation of the city's building stock
And in transport

Other emission sectors such as industry or waste management have a much smaller impact on emissions and in total account for less than 15%. For the industrial sector, emission reductions concern both the use of energy and heat for buildings, but above all the decarbonisation of the production processes themselves. Additional areas are the decarbonisation of waste management and water and sewage management as well as adaptation to climate change through the development of blue-green infrastructure and the protection of existing greenery and the unsealing of paved surfaces.

### Built environment

The priority of these measures is to reduce the residents demand for heat and electricity. Replacing fossil sources with renewable sources in the same quantity may be difficult but also unjustifiable in terms of energy efficiency. Therefore, it is important to reduce energy consumption. Moreover, the energy transition will result in costs that may be reflected in energy prices in Poland, so thermo-modernisation is necessary to reduce energy poverty. Most of the building stock in Wroclaw consists of buildings with low energy classes and often not even fulfilling the energy efficiency standards. This results in significant consumption of heat in particular and the need to scale up the energy system.

For this reason, increasing the energy efficiency of buildings will be a priority in the area of building construction. It assumes, first of all, the thermo-modernisation of private, cooperative buildings and those belonging to enterprise and institutions not related to the municipality, as well, as the municipal stock of residential and commercial buildings. Most of the buildings that require modernisation are privately owned. Only 10% of the city's buildings are in municipal possession. Therefore, the conclusions of the NEEST pilot project carried out within the framework of the Cities Mission may be particularly valuable for speeding up the process of renovating buildings, which will identify the most beneficial ways of effectively, economically efficient and socially acceptable modernisation of the building stock regarding different types of residential and non-residential buildings. These recommendation can be used by the residents themselves but also by regional and national authorities in the context of planning financial and technical support programmes.

Over the next few years, the city will continue the thermal modernisation of public buildings and residential buildings in the municipal stock, with the aim of increasing their energy efficiency, and will focus on creating a system of incentives and support systems for private buildings owners to undertake such measures. The city has an identified pool of investment projects related to improving the energy efficiency of residential buildings in the municipal housing stock and public buildings. The city also runs programmes to support residents in thermal modernisation measures, but these need to be strengthened. Such support is also provided under national programmes.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

It is therefore an important element in speeding up the renovation trend to provide expert advice to residents on the technical aspects of the investments to be made, as well as on the possibilities of using municipal, regional and national funding for thermo-modernisation measures. At the moment, these programmes are highly dispersed and based on different accessibility criteria.

Renovation and thermo-modernisation of non-residential buildings generally concern private buildings- services or production facilities, therefore the city has established cooperation with some of these entities and the city hopes that they will undertake measures to reduce energy demand and strive for neutrality. In the case of municipal/public utility buildings, the necessary work will also be carried out, e.g. in schools and kindergartens (thermo-modernisation, energy management, energy production from renewable energy sources e.g. Small RES Programme).

In the case of new buildings, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation with the development community as a major player in the city's property market and to implement public investments in the zero- or near-zero-carbon facilities, using heat recovery, mechanical ventilation or energy production form RES. The city also has a social housing company (TBS Wroclaw), so it is important that new residential and non-residential buildings have a positive energy balance or are zero-emission.

The process of upgrading the city's lightning with LED luminaries, which will significantly reduce energy consumption, will also continue, as will further action on the issue of recovering and using waste heat form production processes, cooling systems, server rooms, sewage and other sources within the city.

The main stakeholders in this sector are:

Government of the Republic of Poland, the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management and other operators of funding programmes- the deep thermo-modernisation of buildings involves enormous costs (for the municipality's own investments or financial support for residents), so it is a crucial here to secure adequate funding for local authorities from external sources.
Science sector- reducing the demand for primary energy requires a continuous search for and implementation of innovative solutions in the form of: ways to reduce consumption, energy recovery methods, ways to use waste energy, efficient storage of surplus energy.
Municipal companies and manufacturing, commercial, service companies- these are energy-intensive and have a high potential for reducing consumption and using waste or renewable energy.
Public facility administrators ( e.g. schools, public authority buildings, cultural buildings)- have been covered by a common purchasing group for electricity and gas for several years, which allow them to save financial resources; it is important to carry out thermo-modernisation and energy reduction measures in these buildings, e.g. by monitoring consumption, energy management, reduction of reactive power.
Construction and renovation companies, as well as cooperatives and housing associations- the entities operating in the building sector and those administering the buildings- have a huge influence on the development and implementation of new energy standards in new and renovated buildings. Without their involvement, it will be difficult to carry out effective measures in this area.
Residents, especially in the area of preserving the principles of a fair energy transition and protection vulnerable groups.

## Electricity and heat generation

Decarbonisation of energy production (in the case of Wroclaw, this is produced in a cogeneration system as electricity and heat). This means, as a first step, switching to fuel gas from the currently used hard coal. This process has already partly started (one heat and power plant has switched to gas and the main one is the investment planning process). In the next step, it is possible to switch to decarbonised gases or large-scale renewable sources.

The decarbonisation of individual heat sources is also underway. The replacement of furnaces, which is mainly related to improving air quality but also indirectly contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, is slowly coming to an end. Unfortunately, much of the replacement has involved the

7

installation of gas-fired furnaces, which will require further measures in the feature (e.g. installation of heat pumps). This problem is all the more important as there is a relatively high proportion of individual heat sources in Wroclaw (the municipal district heating network covers 53% of demand).

In Wroclaw, the production of electricity from renewable sources is developing dynamically, both by residents, entrepreneurs for production processes, municipal companies (for their own needs and, following changes to regulations, also for the needs of other public or other entities within the framework of civic energy), within cooperatives/ communities/ energy clusters. At the moment, there are no longer-scale photovoltaic farms in the city due to spatial conditions and high demand for land for development. In the case of wind energy, due to high urbanisation of the area and spatial and social conflicts, it is not the preferred direction unless new technologies less intrusive to the environment emerge. Water energy is partially exploited but there is no prospect of increasing this potential.

A source of energy that has not been fully recognised in the city area is waste energy (sewage, servers, production halls, shopping centres). Investment in obtaining waste heat from the sewage network is developing in this case (one investment has already been made in this area covering about 5% of the heat demand). Further analyses of possibilities in this direction are being carried out.

In this area, it is crucial to replace fossil energy sources in the production of electricity and heat with renewable or low-carbon sources. A key action in this area is to change the energy mix the National Energy System (NES) therefore, at the local level, it is important to cooperate strongly with State-owned energy companies in the process of moving away from fossil fuels to low-carbon fuels (e.g. natural gas a transition fuel), and further based on renewable sources (e.g. biogas, green hydrogen, nuclear energy, large-scale heat pumps, geothermal energy).

An important element of system efficiency is also the modernisation of transmission and distribution networks so that they are adapted to the dynamic development of the producer market and distributed prosumer installations.

An innovative approach will also be use waste energy sources on a wider scale, e.g. from the water-sewage system or industry. A very important part of transformation is also the development of an efficient and effective energy storage system for both electricity and heat.

At the local level, it is important to further develop renewable energy installations both on municipal buildings, public utilities (continuation of the Small RES Programme for public facilities indicated in 2022). And on the facilities and sites of municipal companies and units. RES generation will be an important element in the pursuit of climate neutrality of municipal companies, i.e. Municipal Transport Company, Municipal Water and Sewerage Company, Ecosystem Sp. z o.o. These co-partnership's can use their proprieties to invest in RES (photovoltaic's, biogas, plants).

The programme of tax exemptions for residents and businesses for installing renewable energy installations will be continued, as will the modified Kawka+ programme, which allows for subsidies to be granted for replacement of high-emission heat sources with low-emission installations, but also for the installation of renewable energy sources: photovoltaic storage facilities. In addition, a team of energy advisers is in place for local residents on the occasion of the Kawka+ programme.

The Wroclaw heating system operates in a cogeneration system so the decarbonisation of electricity production will also result in charge to this system. This means that, also in this case, the production of heat is on the side of companies belonging to the State Treasury, while the distribution of heat is in the hands of private company (Fortum). Cooperation activities in the context of the decarbonisation of heat and power production in cogeneration have already been undertaken. A Decarbonisation Team has been established, which includes representatives of the key entities involved in this process. The necessary discussions to carry out this action are taking place within the team.

The key stakeholders in this sector are:

State-owned energy companies- producers of energy and heat. The rate of decarbonisation of the heat and power plants supplying the city depends, to a large extent, on the rate of decarbonisation of the entire city.

Energy distribution- Wroclaw's power grid needs to be modernised and adapted to new functions related to the development of prosumer energy and the need for energy storage, which means introduction modern energy transmission management systems on which depends, among other things, the profitability of investing in renewable energy sources in the city
Government of the Republic of Poland and relevant ministries- decarbonisation plans of energy companies depend largely on the policy at the national level, with State Treasury being the main shareholder in these companies. Also important are legal regulations on renewable and the prosumer market in terms of, i.e., favourable accounting of the costs of energy production from renewable or regulation providing opportunities for the development of civic energy in cities.

## Transport and mobility

The most significant action in this sector is the reduction in the scale of individual car transport combined with the development of public and other non-car transport and the electrification of both individual and commercial transport as well as public transport.

Transport is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the Wroclaw area, after construction industry and stationary energy, accounting for almost 31% of all emissions and a source of air pollution. These emissions are mainly generated by road transport, with individual car transport accounting for the largest share. Therefore, key actions should concern the development of low-emission public transport and other alternative ways of moving around the city that are attractive, affordable, and safe for people using individual car transport.

Wroclaw is systematically and consistently developing public transport based on tram, bus and rail transport. This includes both improving travel conditions on the existing network by modernising it and building new transport corridors. It is also replacing the rolling stock with more energy-efficient an low- or zero-emission vehicles. Hydrogen-powered buses are also being tested. Alongside the development of public transport, a system of cycle routes is also being developed including green cycle routes as alternative transport corridors away from min roads. Transport workload is also being increased in cooperation with the agglomeration railway operator (Lower Silesian Railways, a company managed by the provincial government). The use of public transport on a wider scale is also to be encouraged by new P+R car parks in created transfer hubs, an increase in the number of safe and accessible stops, and the development of environmentally friendly (green track and green stops) transport infrastructure.

A measure affecting the reduction of emissions from individual car transport will be the development of electromobility. This means building, together with private partners, an appropriate charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. Shared transport will also be promoted.

The main stakeholders, in this sector, are:

Government of the Republic of Poland, the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management and other operators of funding programmes- investments in public transport are costly, so the key role here is to ensure adequate funding for local authorities from external sources. Electromobility development, on the other hand, requires support through, for instance, appropriate tax relief or subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles.
The provincial government at regional level- as the agglomeration rail transport operator and owner of the Lower Silesian Railways- is a key player in the development of rail transport and tariff integration at city and functional area level.
Enterprises- operators of vehicle charging stations through which appropriate infrastructure can be developed and maintained to encourage the purchase and use of electric vehicles.
Municipal corporations- responsible for the development of pedestrian infrastructure, cycling and the public transport network
Residents- the issues of reducing car traffic and changing transport habits are socially sensitive topics, and therefore the residents of the areas affected by the changes will be involved in each consultation process on specific solutions.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Green infrastructure

Blue-green infrastructure and climate change adaptation measures have less impact on direct emission reductions but are important in terms of reducing energy consumption, quality of life, climate change adaptation and can influence transport behaviour variables.

Green areas in the city need to be protected from excessive urbanisation pressure, renaturalised, increased in terms of providing ecosystem services, as well as increasing the area of biologically active surface where this is possible and most needed. As part of protection of the blue-green infrastructure, the city, incl., through local plans, will influence the densification of urban development in such way as to protect areas of natural value and ensure the sustainability of development (this is particularly important in highly urbanised areas as well as newly created development areas). The compact cities being developed must take climate action adaption issues into account as the greatest challenge to civilisation in the coming years. Action in this area are already being carried out e.g. by deconstructing sealed surfaces, introducing courtyards and schoolyards using blue-green considerations.

The maintenance and development of blue-green infrastructure is very important both in terms of sequestering surplus carbon, as well as in terms of adaptation actions, increasing the city's resilience to the effects of climate change and increasing access for residents to recreational areas.

Planned actions include: securing natural areas from further urbanisation pressures (which will help to ensure the protection and restoration of areas of natural value, e.g. the creation of a reserve on irrigation fields), planting trees and shrubs, increasing biologically active areas and unsealing impervious surfaces, expending small retention facilities.

These activities will be implemented both through direct investments by the city, such as the continuation of the programme of modernisation and greening of streets, the planning of trees as part of existing GROWinWROclaw programme, the expansion of green tracks and other activities. There will also be continuation and expansion of the activities of deconstructing courtyards and squares. Supporting actions are the implementation and enforcement of greenery management standards (greenery protection standards in investments processes, greenery maintenance standards). It is planned to prepare an ambitious plan for greening the city. The Strategy for Managing Stormwater and Meltwater in Wroclaw (2023), which also includes blue-green projects, will also be implemented.

The city also encourages residents, cooperatives, housing communities and entrepreneurs to deconstruct pavements plant greenery and set up small retention facilities on land owned by them, through education (e.g. Good Practice Guides for rainwater management in urbanised and road areas) and support programmes- expert advice from municipal entities and grant programmes for small retention facilities, as well as a civic budget.

Emission gap after implementation of activities form the action plan

The table complements the previous one (Table 14) and shows the amount of emission reductions as a result of carrying out the actions planned in this action plan. Combined with the actions planned under the SECAP, this results in emission reductions approaching 80%.

The overall target should be absolute or net-zero (i.e. including the compensation of any residual emissions). |   | These are the emissions reductions that would be achieved through existing policies, and plans, outlined in Section A-2.1. Those actions are by definition not part of the action portfolio in section B. If they are fully or partially incorporated in module B-2, their associated reduction potential should be referenced in column (5) and not be included here. WARNING if the baseline is a BAU scenario: If the BAU modelling includes any of these existing measures, please also do not include the associated emissions reduction in this column as otherwise it would be double counted. |   | (4) = (2) - (3) |   | This column is used to present the already quantified emission reduction associated with the action portfolios outlined in module B-2. Ideally, this equals the gap. If the there is a difference between the reduction potential of the actions specified in module B-2 (for instance because their reduction potential has not been fully estimated or because additional measures will be identified in future iterations), the CCC AP should be explicit about this difference and explain how the difference will be closed.

| Implementation | Responsible bodies/person for implementation | Wroclaw Municipality, energy and heating companies |
| Action scale & addressed entities | Covers the entire city area. Activities carried out by energy and heating companies in agreement with municipal units. |
| Involved stakeholders | Wroclaw Municipality, energy and heating companies, housing cooperatives |
| Comments on implementation – consider mentioning resources, timelines, milestones | Investments in activities aimed at decarbonising the energy industry, which is currently largely based on fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and heating oil, are activities with a very large impact on the city's final reduction goal. The use of renewable sources to the widest possible extent by switching to RES at the source or building low-temperature heating systems located in the city will significantly reduce emissions and improve air quality.

The activity of developing a heating network requires large financial outlays. The development of a heating network in new investment areas is often unprofitable or impossible to implement due to the dispersion of recipients or the reimbursement of its implementation costs. However, the development of this network in highly urbanised areas is also difficult due to the technical complexity of the solutions and the necessary interference with the existing infrastructure.

In addition, the development of small heating networks based on local boiler plants fired with heat pumps is an alternative for all those places in the city where there is no heating network or where there are boiler plants fired with fossil fuels. |

| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Involved stakeholders | Wroclaw Municipality, municipal companies and entities, private entrepreneurs, residents, universities  |
|   | Comments on implementation – consider mentioning resources, timelines, milestones | In Wroclaw, the tax incentive system has effectively influenced the rapid increase in renewable energy sources among private users. This effect was additionally supported by favourable settlement regulations at the national level. Maintaining this trend is necessary, therefore appropriate legislation is important, as well as modernisation of electric grids at the national and regional level so that they are ready to accept new users. From the point of view of the growing use of RES, power grids must be constantly developed so that they do not fail and are better managed. Implementation of intelligent power grid management systems consists primarily in using systems for: optimizing energy transmission in the networks of energy operators, supervision of energy flow in intelligent networks, management of local energy storage facilities.

In the case of public facilities, especially educational ones, obtaining energy from RES allows to reduce operating costs.

Creating energy clusters is a new form of the so-called civic energy. In the near future, such a cluster will be created in agreement with universities in Wroclaw. Also in this case, the development of this type of prosumer energy depends on national regulations. In Wroclaw, there is a certain potential of this type, both with the use of public and private buildings. The activity of civic energy has a positive impact on the increase in the use of RES, provides the opportunity for cooperation in the field of energy production, activation of society and reduction of energy costs, and also improves the quality of the environment and the state of the climate. Another element of obtaining energy from RES are large-scale photovoltaic farms. In this case, the availability of land for this type of installation is limited due to the high urbanization of the area and environmental restrictions (soils, valley areas, greenery, birds). However, there is a possibility of locating this type of installation. In this context, cooperation at the regional level is also important, especially within the Wroclaw Functional Area, because Wroclaw is surrounded by large areas of agricultural, open areas, which can potentially be a reservoir for the production of energy from renewable sources for the needs of the city. There are also plans to implement a photovoltaic farm for the needs of the city's transport company, which would fulfill the postulates  |

Action description

The action involves increasing energy efficiency in existing residential and commercial buildings owned by the city and other public and private entities, through deep thermal modernisation and optimisation of energy consumption by installing intelligent energy management systems and installing RES (electricity and heat). The action includes, among others:

Utilisation of municipal support programmes for thermal modernisation by residents - subsidies under the Kawka + programme
Continuation of the replacement of heat sources until 2028 (in accordance with the requirements of the Anti-smog Act for the Lower Silesian Voivodeship)
Utilisation of national funds by residents as part of subsidies from the programmes: Clean Air, Warm Apartment, Stop Smog
Utilisation of funds as part of loans from the National Economy Bank (TERMO Programme)
Development of a transformation model for quarters of various types of buildings under the NEEST pilot programme
Monitoring of energy consumption in facilities
Reactive power compensation in public facilities
Implementation of the PoWROty programme - preparation of documentation and modernisation of tenement houses in the municipal housing stock of 22 tenement houses (ultimately for 100)

is dependent on financial support systems at the national, EU and regional levels and the availability of a sufficient number of qualified service providers on the market.

In addition, the measure assumes stimulating investments in the modernisation of private, residential and utility buildings (industrial, commercial, service, warehouse), belonging to housing cooperatives, enterprises and institutions not related to local government, private individuals, by creating a system of incentives and financial and substantive support for building owners.

The implementation of this measure on a large scale is also dependent on financial support systems at the national, EU and regional levels, in particular subsidy and credit programmes on preferential terms and support instruments for people affected by energy poverty, as well as the introduction of national and legal regulations motivating building owners to undertake modernisation activities, e.g. the implementation of the European "buildings directive" (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, EPBD).

The essence of the action is to reduce energy demand and use emission-free energy sources by designing and constructing new buildings, in accordance with high energy efficiency standards. The city has a direct influence only on the energy standard of its own buildings. The condition for effective implementation of high efficiency standards for buildings is legislative changes at the national level, e.g. implementation of the EU "building directive" (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, EPBD).

Actions consisting in replacing non-ecological heat sources through subsidy programmes addressed to residents and small entrepreneurs directly affect the reduction of the city's CO2 emissions and improve air quality. Low emission is a direct cause of smog in the city and its effects. Subsidy programmes mobilize entities to act and are an effective form of combating low city emissions and can be implemented for many years. They require large financial outlays and the introduction of a system of incentives and educational campaigns for all interested in replacing the heat source.

The actions taken should also include those related to spatial policy, bearing in mind that space is a limited resource and the way it is used, in particular the dispersion of development and dysfunctional spatial structure,

|   |  Comments on implementation – consider mentioning resources, timelines, milestones | The basis for achieving climate neutrality and implementing energy transformation is raising the level of social awareness and stakeholder involvement. Actively involving all social groups in development processes is beneficial for finding lasting and acceptable solutions that guarantee socio-economic development. Improving the creation and dissemination of knowledge bases and best practices is also of particular importance in this process. Increasing the level of knowledge about climate and the environment requires the support of society and interested entities, as well as the promotion of knowledge about sustainable development and new models of sustainable consumption. Full knowledge and awareness of the problems resulting from energy transformation (e.g. periodic increase in energy prices) will allow for gaining social acceptance, which is an essential element of achieving climate neutrality. Enabling citizens and consumers to become active participants in the transformation is also intended to provide energy-poor households with easier access to energy-efficient buildings and cheaper energy sources based on renewable energy sources. Available data indicate that the energy poverty rate in households living in single-family houses in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship in 2016 was 12.4% (35,113 households – no dedicated data for Wroclaw). Targeting information and support activities for this group of residents of the voivodeship is one of the significant challenges.  |

These emissions are mainly generated by road transport, with individual car transport accounting for the largest share. Therefore, the key actions should concern the development of low-emission public transportation and other alternative ways of getting around the city that will be attractive, comfortable, physically accessible and affordable, safe for people moving around the city by individual car transport. Wroclaw is systematically and consistently developing public transportation based on tramway, bus and rail transportation. This includes both improving travel conditions on the existing network through its modernization and building new transport corridors. Transportation work is also being increased in cooperation with the agglomeration rail operator, which is a company under the management of the province's local government). The use of public transport on a wider scale is also to be encouraged by new P+R parking lots in created interchanges, an increase in the number of safe and accessible stops, and the development of environmentally friendly (green tracks and green stops) transport infrastructure. The measure assumes the continuation of these activities in accordance with the adopted sector documents at the urban level.  |

# B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

To close the gap from reducing emissions to  $80\%$  of net climate neutrality, primarily actions as a result of independent sequestration of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  (through the selection of vegetation and the scope of blue-green infrastructure areas) within the city. Much of this activity has been demonstrated within the Green Infrastructure and Nature-based activities sector. A specific action plan will be presented in one of the next iterations of the document, including: preparing an ambitious plan for greening the city.

However, at this stage of work on the climate contract for Wroclaw, no other activities related to the reduction of residual emissions are planned. We assume that the organisational and financial effort that we must undertake to implement the planned activities will not allow us to effectively implement additional projects with a high degree of technical and financial uncertainty (e.g. related to geological sequestration, the use of which will only be possible after the emergence of new, more effective and cheaper technologies). The situation is similar with the purchase of carbon credits - green certificates confirming the reduction of greenhouse gases by investing in an environmental project. The issues of purchasing carbon credits must be thoroughly analysed by legal and accounting services in terms of their compliance with the regulations governing the functioning of local governments.

# The impact of the national level on local emission reductions

The effects of emission reduction resulting from the action plan presented in the action plan depend largely on the electricity emission index. In turn, this indicator depends on the amount of energy used in the city from the national system, including its emissivity and renewable electricity produced in the city and for the city's needs and its purchase

The National Centre for Emissions Management (KOBiZE) publishes the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ,  $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ , NOx, CO and total dust emission indicators for electricity every year.

Product emission indicators are information used to assess changes in the ecological condition of individual economic sectors. The above-mentioned indicators are also used when calculating the ecological effect in the case of modernisation or implementation of new projects resulting in emission reduction. The total emission volume in KOBiZE materials includes emissions reported to the National Database on emissions of greenhouse gases and other substances. The National Database collects, among others: information on emissions from fuel burning installations that produced only electricity or electricity and heat in a given year (installations producing only heat were not taken into account). All fuels were taken into account, including renewable ones, which were reported to the National Database as used in combustion processes and responsible for the emissions of the pollutants in question. KOBiZE additionally determines the emission indicators of electricity for end users, i.e. after
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

taking into account all electricity produced in the country (fuel combustion installations and energy from renewable energy sources - the so-called RES) and losses on the transmission and distribution of electricity.

This indicator for 2022 was 685 kg CO₂/MWh and was lower than in 2018 when it was 708 kg CO₂/MWh.

The gradual electrification of final energy consumption in construction, infrastructure and transport means that this indicator and the volume of electricity in the city are of key importance for the volume of emissions and for the process of achieving climate neutrality.

In the study Polska Net-Zero 2050 Road Map for Achieving Community Climate Policy Goals for Poland Until 2050 by KOBiZE and of Environmental Protection - National Research Institute (IOŚ-PIB from June 2021, a change in this indicator is forecast in the system of adopted scenarios for the needs of the national road map.

Based on the above the study assumes a reduction of the national indicator from the current level of approximately 700 kg CO₂/MWh to 200-450 kg in 2030 and below 100 kg in 2050.

It follows that the achievable emission reduction effect in Wroclaw, especially in the 2030 perspective, depends significantly on changes in the power supply system of the national power system, which will determine the scale of EF reduction in the national system. Therefore, the final residual emission may be lower than expected.

## 3.3. Module B-3 Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

### B-3.1: Impact pathways

The city has many strategic documents for which it collects indicators. In the case of broadly understood climate policy, these include: Wroclaw City Strategy by 2030, Climate Change Adaptation Plan (MPA), Environmental Protection Programme (EPP), Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), Wroclaw Mobility Policy, State of the city report, Sustainable Energy and Climate Plan (SECAP), Economy Plan Low-emission (PGN). We also report to the Statistics Poland in the field of greenery, waste, mobility and water and sewage management. In addition, we strive to present reports on the platform provided by the Covenant of Mayors and, to a limited extent, on the CDP/ICLEI platform.

Completing all this data by units at the office level or municipal units and companies is time-consuming and requires additional resources. Unfortunately, we do not have a separate unit dealing with the analysis of urban data, so the proposed indicators must be, to some extent, complementary to those already collected for the city.

In the case of emission reduction activities, the annual inventory of greenhouse gas emissions performed for the purposes of PGN and SECAP is crucial, and will become an important element of CCC monitoring. In addition, a good tool for evaluating activities in CCC and its future iterations may be the use of an economic model in which assumptions can be modified depending on the progress of tasks and the changing legal and economic environment.

The idea behind the indicators:

Possible to obtain by those implementing activities, including municipal units
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

5

Tailored to CCC's areas of operation

Relating to emission inventories (result indicators), but also to individual activities (output indicators)

As activities within the CCC include tasks in the field of, among others: transport, which is an important emission sector, it is proposed to use indicators for mobility policy and SUMP (annual monitoring since 2013)

Similarly, indicators for the 2030 Strategy and the new 2050 (under development) - they may partly refer to co-benefits and general improvement of the quality of life in the city

Typical mitigation indicators would be related to a decrease in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions from individual sectors and an increase in the share of energy production from renewable energy sources

As part of CCC monitoring, tracking of the emission factor from energy and heat production may be taken into account - in the national and local system (based on the actual energy production sources used by the local energy and heat producer (KOGENERACJA) - the national mix will improve but locally it may be different - the emission factor from energy production is crucial for the correct calculation of emissions in the inventory and, consequently, emission reduction - examples of how this affects emission reduction are above in the chapter about residual emission).

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

## 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

### C-1.1: Description or visualisation of the participatory governance model for climate neutrality

In 2017, the Sustainable Development Department was established, called “Green Department”. One of the goals of the department was work on the topic of climate neutrality. The results were the Low Emission Plan (PGN) and Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP).

However, works of the new department and its tasks did not immediately and directly contribute to the shift in municipal actions and investment decisions. It was the fight against air pollution and the obligation to implement “anti-smog resolutions” in 2018³⁶, followed by the City Council Position³⁷ on climate emergency, that mobilized the city to take a serious approach to the topic of replacing heat sources, which, in addition to high dust emissions, are a source of greenhouse gas emissions, because they are based on burning the most emitting fossil fuels.

In 2018 r. there was established in municipality Smart City Office promoting Smart City Wroclaw³⁸. The idea of Smart City Wroclaw is based on six pillars: smart economy, smart people, smart mobility, smart environment, smart management, smart way of life. The unit focuses on supporting activities that improve the quality of life of residents, pro-environment and pro-innovation, as well as investments related to supporting mobility and public transportation.

CityLab is part of Smart City Wroclaw. Its goal is to create areas in the city space where entrepreneurs, start-ups, researchers will be able to test innovative solutions in the public space. Currently, the Lab's priority is to study technologies that affect the environment and the health of residents, namely those related to transportation and the reduction of low emissions.

There is no smart city without open data. Wroclaw, like other cities in Poland and around the world, wants to make available as much of the data produced and processed by the city as possible, thus simplifying access to public information. Open Data Wroclaw is a Wroclaw-based Internet service that allows all interested parties to quickly and easily access public information collected by the Wroclaw Municipality and other city units. It is also a way to meet the expectations of Wroclaw residents who want to learn about the way the city functions. Open data is information or datasets that everyone can freely use. They can be distributed and used basically without any restrictions, including for commercial purposes.

In Wroclaw, decarbonisation of the construction and transportation sectors will be key to the energy transition. In the case of transportation, efforts to promote public transportation and other environmentally friendly transportation solutions have already been underway for many years. A Bicycle Officer was appointed in 2007. The main tasks of the bicycle officer in Wroclaw have been coordinating all matters related to bicycles, including: creation and implementation of bicycle policy, investment in bicycle infrastructure, coordination of the bicycle rental system, creating a network of bicycle routes, cooperation with non-governmental organisations for cyclists. Bicycle rental system called Wroclaw City Bicycle is an alternative means of transportation, allowing residents to get around the city quickly. It complements public transportation.

In 2015, the Bicycle Officer was joined by a Pedestrian Officer. Pedestrian Officer's tasks are to ensure that pedestrians are treated as equal participants in traffic, that the infrastructure provided for them meets current standards, so that pedestrians feel safe, move quickly and efficiently through the city.

In the case of public transportation and efforts to increase its use, free tickets for certain groups using public transportation were introduced in 2018. Elementary, secondary, high school students have free tickets until they turn 21, as for senior citizens, it was 69, since 2022 the age was reduced to 65 years. It comes along with increasing paid parking zone and parking fees in the city centre, expanding "Park and Ride" lots and designating special parking spaces for zero-emission vehicles. In 2023 city started discussion and consultation process on the introduction of a low-emission zone for the city centre and parts of the downtown area.

In terms of housing and involving residents in the climate transition, a more organized process began with the establishment of "Wroclaw without smog" information and support campaign. With the implementation of the "anti-smog resolutions" came support systems consisting of municipal Energy Advisors, dedicated funds and cooperation of many groups of stakeholders. As these actions started to grow and developed, since year 2020 they were all gathered under the umbrella "Change the stove" action.

Energy Advisors, in addition to the consultation desk at the municipality's headquarters, they also worked "in the field", reaching municipal districts, in cooperation with municipal district councils. Contacting individual building managers, participating in community meetings, they helped residents go through the process of eliminating stoves, presenting them with offers, funding programmes, solutions and dispelling doubts. A set of programmes (financial, informational, organisational) aimed at encouraging city residents to replace their heat sources: full subsidisation of the cost of replacing stoves - KAWKA Plus, exemptions and rent reductions, subsidies for the replacement of wooden, leaky windows - Thermo KAWKA, subsidies for heating bills for people who have eliminated solid fuel stoves - Local Shield Programme³⁹. It was all followed by information,

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

cooperation, billboards, website, competitions. The process of replacing stoves related to improving air quality is slowly coming to an end. However, much of the replacement has involved the installation of gas furnaces, which will require further measures in the future, such as the installation of heat pumps. But procedures have been established, proven methods for engaging and educating residents and other stakeholders. More procedures and mechanisms involving citizens towards a shared understanding and buy-in of the climate agenda are described in next chapter "Social innovations".

In order to encourage building owners to install renewable energy sources, a resolution was passed in 2019⁴⁰. Those who incur the cost of purchasing or connecting a photovoltaic system (or other above-mentioned energy sources) to a building or part of a building can apply for a property tax exemption, after meeting certain conditions.

The Municipality⁴¹ has initiated in 2012 Purchasing Group. A purchasing group combines the needs of multiple units for a given medium by appointing a single unit to carry out the procedure for the purchase (in the case of Wroclaw) of gas and electricity. Currently, there are two purchasing groups: gas - a comprehensive contract, i.e. purchase and distribution of gas; and electricity group: energy purchase (without distribution) for facilities and public lighting. In 2025, the electricity group will expand to include the supply of facilities for which RES have been implemented. The purchasing group brings together municipal companies, cultural entities, schools and kindergartens. The city is responsible for organising the procedure, selecting the contractor and changing the seller. After signing the contracts, the units themselves implement their contracts, are responsible for payments and for the fulfilment of obligations by the contractor/vendor.

Complementing the activities of the energy purchasing group is the Energy Saving Register. This is an electronic application for the recording of planned and incurred costs and consumption of utilities, the handling of processes in purchasing groups as well as the implementation of purchasing groups, as well as implemented laws, decrees and regulations in the area of utility cost control and statistics. It obliges municipal building managers to periodically report on the costs incurred for utility consumption and the savings measures carried out.

From 2022, the city⁴² coordinates the implementation of RES projects on selected buildings of city units - e.g. educational facilities. On the basis of the projects, the units appoint installation contractors, while the city additionally appoints a supervision inspector.

As for involving stakeholders in the process of changes, different groups of stakeholders can have a real impact on city policy through community councils. Community Council is a body, composed of representatives of various professional and creative circles, non-governmental organisations, city institutions, private business, but also the public sector and universities, who decide to socially interact as a consultative and advisory body to the mayor of the city. There are 23 Community Councils, each of them represents a specific group of Wroclaw residents, including: seniors, children and youth, people with disabilities, cyclists or entrepreneurs, there is Mobility Policy Council, Council for Bicycle Policy and Council for Ecology, among others.

Joining the "100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission" provided the Municipality opportunity to accelerate activities towards climate transition and better organize them. After becoming the Mission city, the Sustainable Development Department, in order to set up a cooperation through departments, units and companies, started working on building Transition Team, consisting of Interdepartmental Team, Decarbonisation Team and there was Air Quality and Energy Efficiency Team working till June 2024.

Interdepartmental Team was established in year 2022, by Mayoral Ordinance⁴³. Team consists of representatives of divisions, units and municipal companies, engaged in transformation processes in the city.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Each person acts as a liaison and works towards building close cooperation and better coordination of work between departments. The team meets at least 4 times a year to discuss the progress of the implementation of the objectives of the City Mission in their organisational units. The division of authority and responsibility between the various organisational units and individuals allows for efficient management and implementation of activities in accordance with the planned objectives. The team representatives in their units have separate “implementation teams” to make management decisions and monitor the progress of the work of implemented initiatives, including climate neutrality activities. For example:

in the Department of Infrastructure and Transport, there is a cross-cutting team that carries out ongoing monitoring of ongoing investments, meeting a minimum of once every three weeks with the implementing units and quarterly reporting on the solutions implemented, possible remediation plan for the next period).

in the Public Finance Department there is a team of people who look for funding from regional, national, European sources and private investors.

The activities of the Interdepartmental Team at the current stage focus in particular on strengthening climate issues in urban planning documents and cooperation in this regard at regional level. At city level, the Wroclaw 2050 Strategy (with a strongly embedded climate component) is being developed. These goals are also being reinforced in updates to sectoral policies and programmes such as the Wroclaw Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), the Sustainable Mobility Plan for the Wroclaw Urban Functional Area (37 municipalities), the Electromobility Development Strategy or the Wroclaw Mobility Policy, as well as spatial policy documents.

In year 2023, due to another Mayoral Ordinance⁴⁴, there was appointed Air Quality and Energy Efficiency Team, which played an opinion and advisory role for the city Mayor in the implementation of the anti-smog resolution.

In the same year there was established Decarbonisation Team⁴⁵ as well. The team is working on implementing activities to meet the requirements of the Polish Energy Policy until 2040. The major role of the team is decarbonisation of the heating system of Wroclaw. It consists of representatives of the organisational departments of Wroclaw Municipality, municipal organisational units and municipal companies, as well as energy companies and other institutions. It plays an advisory and coordinating role in the cooperation of the city with energy companies, institutions and external entities on the directions of development and activities in pursuit of decarbonisation of the heating system in Wroclaw.

There is also external cooperation between municipality and external stakeholders, called External Sector Leaders, as a part of cooperation to achieve climate neutrality. Sectors are represented by, among others: academia, NGO-s and private sector - SME entrepreneurs, broken down by sub-sectors: energy/heat, development, cooperatives, architects and designers. Some of the sectors had already created coalitions, for example - Coalition of Wroclaw and Lower Silesian Universities for Sustainable Development and Climate Protection and included actions towards climate neutrality into their agenda. Some of the universities has already signed a declaration on cooperation within the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission.

In parallel, a series of meetings and workshops are being held with various stakeholders in the city who are or can be co-responsible for the implementation process of the measures and financing in their own right. In particular, a great deal of interest can be seen on the business side in terms of energy-related companies, but also developers and the design community responsible for shaping space in the city.

Cooperation, that has been carefully built, is coalition with business. In May 2024, a conference “1.5 Degree Mission – Business for Climate” was organised by the city, dedicated for business. During the conference, representatives of the business community discussed ESG reporting, shared their experiences of implementing pro-climate projects, and presented the benefits of climate neutrality measures. During the event, there was an opportunity to sign a declaration on cooperation within the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission. There was also meeting with development and cooperatives representatives and it resulted in next meeting and potential cooperation. Similar situation is with NGO’s.

For many years, Wroclaw has worked closely with the municipalities of Lower Silesia in order to coordinate development processes in the region more effectively. Representatives of Wroclaw Municipality continued to meet with local government officials from the Wroclaw Metropolitan Area (WrOM) $^{46}$ . Formalised inter-municipal cooperation was reflected in the activities of: Agency for the Development of Wroclaw Agglomeration S.A. (ARAW), the Wroclaw Agglomeration Association (StAW) and the Integrated Territorial Investment of the Wroclaw Functional Area (ZIT WrOF). Meetings of municipal governments concerned, among other things, agreements on bus transport in the agglomeration and solutions to strengthen the idea of the Wroclaw Metropolitan Railway and the implementation of the Sustainable Mobility Plan for the Urban Functional Area of Wroclaw. The result of the cooperation is a common agglomeration ticket, which enables passengers to use public transport in Wroclaw and the neighbouring municipalities.

At the same time, the Wroclaw Municipality is expanding its network of Park&amp;Ride car parks, including on the outskirts of the city, to encourage residents of other towns to switch to public transport when entering the city. In general, expanding Park&amp;Ride car parks and designating more parking spaces for zero-emission vehicles provide additional benefits such as developing habits of using public transport, reducing car journeys in the city centre (reducing congestion) and increasing the share of electric vehicles, improving air quality, resulting in lower hospitalisation costs for residents due to pollution and noise in the city.

On regional level there is close cooperation with Marshal's Office. The city has reached an agreement with the Marshal's Office and signed an agreement with the railway authorities, thanks to which a rail agglomeration ticket is in operation, meaning that the public transport ticket also gives the opportunity to travel by train within the municipality.

This year, a cooperation agreement was signed with the Institute for Territorial Development, regarding projects and initiatives that bring European cities and regions closer to achieving climate neutrality. The memorandum creates a platform for the exchange of knowledge, experience and best practices useful for the city, the entire region and other interested European and national partners. The cooperation is expected to help accelerate decarbonisation and increase the involvement of residents and key stakeholders in efforts to achieve climate neutrality.

The Lower Silesian Hydrogen Valley was established in 2022. The aim of the Association is to support the development of the hydrogen economy, with particular emphasis on the Lower Silesian Voivodship and neighbouring voivodships. Lower Silesian Hydrogen Valley utilises the research and scientific potential of the region to undertake, among other things, innovative scientific, technological and industrial ventures and investment projects aimed at building common hydrogen economy value chains. Furthermore, through its activities, the Lower Silesian Hydrogen Valley promotes pro-environmental attitudes, especially among entrepreneurs and local communities.

On national level, it was crucial establishing Coalition of Polish Mission Cities – which is a Cooperation Agreement between Krakow, Lodz, Rzeszow, Warsaw and Wroclaw. One of the results of this cooperation is Horizon2020 project – NEEST „NetZero Emission and Environmentally Sustainable Territories“, in partnership of five cities. NEEST is a pilot project that will develop necessary and universal models to demonstrate how to carry out comprehensive and locally acceptable modernisation of buildings and neighbourhoods to improve their energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electricity and heat consumption.

Building the dialogue platform for the climate transition with stakeholders on national level is supported by CapaCITIES project $^{47}$ . CapaCITIES is bringing together key players in the transition process, namely national, regional authorities and cities, including Ministry of Economic Development and Technology, Ministry of Climate and Environment, Ministry of Development Funds and Regional Policy. We all are aware that achieving the goal of climate neutrality requires cooperative coordination and innovation at multiple levels of governance.

On December 6-7, 2023, the CapaCITIES National Event was held as part of the National Urban Forum, with the Ministry of Development Funds and Regional Policy. During the event, the Polish Mission Cities presented the experiences developed in implementing the Mission and identified barriers to climate transformation in

cities (legislative, financial, other). During the event, the need to include representatives of ministries and government institutions in the implementation of the Mission was emphasized.

Wroclaw is also active on international level – cooperating with several organisations such as Metrex, ICLEI, Eurocities. In 2022 the city has been recognized internationally for its commitment to climate adaptation and refugee assistance. The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and its partners in the Making Cities Resilient 2030 (MDG2030) global collaboration welcomed Wroclaw as one of the world's Resilience Hubs.

C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

In order to better communicate with residents and involve them in participatory processes, in year 2015 municipality has established Public Participatory Office (changed into Public Participatory Division). Wroclaw has a website dedicated exclusively to public participation “Wroclaw talks”. It is created in an attractive and accessible form that encourages residents to get involved in the participatory process in their city. During participatory processes, Municipality informs residents about: how their activity will be used, how they can influence their surroundings, how they can monitor the progress of the processes in which they participate, and what the next steps in the process are. During the public consultation, strategic documents are analysed in order to obtain feedback from residents-comments on local development policies.

All citizens and residents of Wroclaw are encouraged to take part in participatory processes. One of the conditions for conducting public consultations in Wroclaw is to ensure their wide availability. When

using digital tools, city prepares instructions for their use. Municipality uses the support of sign language interpreters, city also takes care of digital accessibility of documents. In recent years, Wroclaw has tried to increase the number of actions involving children and young people in participatory processes, who are also residents of the city and users of its infrastructure.

The Public Participatory Division cooperates with Local Activity Centres (CALs). There are 21 CALs, these are places run by local NGO's, with initiatives co-created together with residents. At the local level, the Centres are a strong glue supporting the process of social change. There are also District Councils, which cooperate with Wroclaw City Council. There are 48 such institutions in the city.

District councils together with CALs build a network of places, actively supporting residents, and are a link between residents and the city. A system that works this way helps build trust, especially among the most marginalized groups in society. Since the Canters are run by local NGOs, they are recognized by residents as their own, operating in the area, which translates into building close relationships and involvement of residents in various actions taken by Centers. Hence, the majority of the city initiatives are carried out either by or in cooperation with CALs and District Councils.

At this point, it is also worth mentioning The Youth City Council. It is a group of young and ambitious people who also want to have an impact on the future of the city. It began its activities more than 25 years ago, in 1994. It was then that the first session of the Youth Parliament of Wroclaw was held, which in 2017 became the Youth Council of the City of Wroclaw. The objectives of the council's activities are primarily to popularize the idea of self-government, create civic attitudes among young people, develop student self-government and represent the youth and student governments of Wroclaw schools to the authorities of Wroclaw and other institutions or organisations. The Youth Council initiates ecological projects. In cooperation with the Department of Sustainable Development, it has announced a competition addressed to students of Wroclaw secondary schools. The purpose of the competition was to adapt schoolyards to climate change, take care of the development of biodiversity in urban space and educate young people about greenery. The competition consisted in creating a concept for developing a school green area in a bio-diverse way, adapted to the needs of students. The best ideas received Department funding and were implemented. There is also Wroclaw Council of Seniors, that was established in 2014 to represent the needs and interests of seniors over 60 years of age who reside in the Wroclaw municipality.

An excellent example of a tool activating the resident in the development of the city, including the subject of counteracting climate change, is the municipal participatory budget called the Wroclaw Participatory Budget, where applications can be submitted with a proposal, for example, greening urban areas. It can be observed how the needs and preferences of residents have been changing over the years with regard to the projects submitted and implemented. At first, they concerned sidewalks, playgrounds, bicycle paths, lighting. Over time, projects for greening the city appeared. In 2016, a special edition dedicated exclusively to green projects was announced. Today, green realisations make up the majority of winning projects, often in combination with a network of bicycle, pedestrian and recreational paths, and smart lighting.

Microgrants is another city-wide programme supporting grassroots local initiatives, within the framework of which residents of Wroclaw (mainly, although this is not a formal requirement) can implement their own ideas for creative ventures aimed at spreading culture in the city, thanks to the financial support received under the programme. The activities undertaken may concern animation, social activation, education, recreation and may be related to any area of art and other fields with a cultural function. The goal of the programme is to help creative people acquire or develop the skills necessary to effectively influence their city, to lead grassroots local initiatives, and to encourage both the community and the originators of the initiatives to creatively exchange ideas and discussions. The
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

programme also aims to use the functional and spatial potential of Wroclaw's neighbourhoods to implement activation and bonding initiatives, with an emphasis on activating areas outside the Old Town. The programme was created in 2018. As more than 200 thousand foreigners already live in Wroclaw. Therefore, **Microgrants** support activities for integration. Applicants for whom Polish is not their first language are welcome as well. Information and consultation meetings are also held in Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian and English.

**District Funds** are separate funds allocated for the implementation of district investments submitted by the District Councils according to the rules and procedures set forth herein. This, along with Wroclaw Participatory Budget and Microgrants, is one of the forms of residents' participation in the allocation of the municipal budget for investments that are important for their neighbourhood. Thanks to the rules of the District Funds, the subjective role of the District Councils in shaping spatial order in the settlements and creating strong local communities is increasing. Very often these are investments in restoring green areas or recreation on the area of neighbourhood.

The city uses external funding to prepare educational and informational campaigns. "**Small steps, big changes**"⁴⁸ campaign started in 2018 and lasted till 2019. The project was aimed at the citizens of Wroclaw and residents of ten municipalities in Lower Silesia. It educated and inspired residents for over a year, drawing their attention to changing their small daily habits regarding choices that affect air quality or the protection of biodiversity in the immediate area. The substantive content of the campaign was prepared based on the National Environmental Monitoring. Since November 2018, 85 meetings have also been organized for nearly 1,600 people, including the Innovation Center, senior citizen clubs, or in schools and kindergartens. About 500 people took part in special workshops at the Zoo and Botanical Garden. And there were nineteen "small steps" presented.

Innovating approach towards climate education and integration gave project C-Change⁴⁹ - Arts and culture leading climate action in cities. The project began in 2018 and ended in Wroclaw with the Green Culture Festival. The main objective of the C-Change project was to implement the good practices developed by Manchester in Wroclaw in creating a network of cooperation between cultural and art institutions. The project envisaged conducting educational activities that contributed to increasing the environmental awareness of residents for the improvement and adaptation to climate change. Cultural and art institutions were finally working together on the collective purpose, building recognition of the unique role the arts and culture could play on climate action and engagement. This resulted in municipal programme "Green Culture".

Actively inviting residents to use urban initiatives such as "Change the stove", "Wroclaw does not waste" increases the resident's awareness of the need to care for the common good and has a direct impact on reducing GHG emissions or mitigating climate change. As for involving residents in the climate transition, a more organized process began with the establishment of "Wroclaw without smog" information and support campaign. With the implementation of the "anti-smog resolutions" came support systems consisting of municipal Energy Advisors, dedicated funds and cooperation of many groups of stakeholders. As these actions started to grow and developed, since year 2020 they were all gathered under the umbrella "Change the stove" action. One of the initiatives involving residents was a competition dedicated creating a "Change the stove" local hero. Residents who replaced their stove were able to enter a competition, sharing their story and experience (presented on billboard or in short movie) and encouraging other residents to do the same. This activity was aimed at breaking

down barriers, showing that replacement is not so complicated, and thanks to this, the "Change the stove" action became more familiar, as it received a neighbour's face.

Wroclaw is open to the participation of residents in the development of the city's policies and actions, including climate issues. In order to engage citizens in more active way, including co-creation process, the city has tested new form of public engagement "civic panel" or "civic meeting".

The "Civic panel" was unique for a number of reasons, from the way participants were selected to the impact of the panel's findings on urban policies. Seventy-five people were selected to participate in the civic panel, taking into account demographic criteria, such as gender and age, the idea being to map the demographic structure of the "city in a nutshell." The role of the civic panel was to analyze the topic "How to improve the movement of people around Wroclaw, with a view to improving the quality of life and protecting the climate?", discussing various solutions, listening to arguments for and against, and then making informed and thoughtful decisions. According to the declaration of the Mayor of Wroclaw, recommendations that receive the support of at least 80 percent of the panel will be treated by him as binding, that is, they will be indicated for implementation. The panel was substantively supported by experts from the country and abroad. The process involved 21 parties representing NGOs, urban movements and District Councils and Wroclaw Municipality. The panellists made a total of 63 recommendations - 50 binding and 13 for consideration. The recommendations are reflected in such documents as the Masterplan for the City Centre, the Wroclaw Tram Programme for the years 2024-2032, Plan for Cycling Actions until 2030.

"Civic meeting" was tested in year 2023, the idea was that each group of stakeholders has its representative, in order to achieve balance between different groups of stakeholders. The topic was redevelopment of Ruska Street, one of the streets in the city centre. Participants discussed solutions such as closing street to cars, introducing more greenery, how to enhance security of residents living there. The civic meeting on the future of Ruska Street showed that it is possible to meet different points of view, discuss the topic, and come to common conclusions.

City also has an experience in introducing new methods of engaging citizens such as systems thinking and systems innovation. These methods take into account a multi-sectoral approach using co-creation with selected stakeholders, like during workshops within NEEST „NetZero Emission and Environmentally Sustainable Territories" project. NEEST is a pilot project that will develop necessary and universal models that will show how to carry out comprehensive and locally acceptable modernisation of buildings and neighbourhoods to improve their energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electricity and heat consumption. The highlight of the workshop was a session on participatory systems mapping – an approach that combines systems thinking, multi-sector approach, co-design and design thinking. The method is directed at developing (co-design) by participants representing organisations from multiple sectors systemic innovations - that is, innovations that go beyond narrowly defined organisational improvements or technological innovations. System innovations take into account dependencies between elements of a larger system and find hidden synergies between them.

There is a whole package of actions dedicated to increasing green space in the city with the involvement of residents and businesses. Thanks to the Green Patronage, residents can contribute to the planting of trees, shrubs or perennial beds in the city, but also enhance the space with small architecture and even a pocket park. The city offers various packages to choose from, depending on the willingness to get involved. The programme is aimed at residents but also businesses. GROWin WROclaw programme involves planting trees with newborns and young children as patrons of the trees. The tree planting campaign is accompanied by a picnic. The trees are planted together with the parents of the children. Each tree has its own number, is often given the child's name and parents

receive a certificate. The goal of the project is to expand the city's green spaces while involving residents. The programme started in 2017 and since then 3431 children have become tree patrons.

WROchef is a competition aimed at elementary school children. Elementary school children are a difficult target when it comes to involving them in pro-environmental actions. The purpose of the competition is to promote a plant-based diet, based on local and seasonal products. It aims to educate students about healthy lifestyles and prevent food waste. But there is innovative way of approaching students – through social media and well-known faces – restaurant chefs and finalists of famous cooking TV shows are being used to promote the competition. The competition entry also looks more like a video from TikTok containing a description and execution of a dish made from plant products than a “good-old” poster. Prizes include cooking with the finalists of TV shows (TopChef and MasterChef). The authors of the best recipes have the opportunity to improve their recipes with the chefs of the restaurants that sponsor the competition.

The "Wroclaw Magnolia" competition is aimed at graduates of Wroclaw universities who, in a given academic year, have defended a master's thesis addressing issues in the field of improving the quality of life of the citizens of Wroclaw, particularly the broadly understood protection of the environment and nature of the City of Wroclaw, as well as the protection of health and human life.

Since 2021, the city has been organizing a family picnic called "Saturday with Green Wroclaw". The picnic is an opportunity to introduce residents to the activities of the Department of Sustainable Development, but also other departments, city companies and organisations cooperating with the city, all in the form of games and activities. The 2023 picnic was combined with the celebration of Sustainability Week and European Mobility Week. The motto was "Together to the Goal," as the information and education campaign on the Sustainable Development Goals was launched with this event.

Changing transportation attitudes, reducing car traffic, promoting public transportation and other forms of clean transportation is crucial to the city's climate transformation. In terms of social innovations two actions stand out. One is Cycling May, the other consultations on introducing clean transportation zone. Cycling May is Poland's largest campaign promoting cycling, scootering, rollerblading or skateboarding among elementary school students and preschoolers. It was born in 2014 in Gdansk, and since 2016 Wroclaw has joined the campaign.

The campaign has an impact:

shaping positive transportation habits,
promoting healthy lifestyles,
in supporting children's independence,
improving traffic safety,
on the environment,
engaging local environments - social and business.

Cycling May, through fun combined with elements of competition, popularizes the bicycle as a means of transportation to school, teaches good and healthy habits that continue even after the campaign ends. Cycling May effectively changes the neighborhoods around schools and kindergartens to be safer and more bike-friendly, reducing the number of cars transporting children and motivating local governments to make pro-bike investments.

In 2023 a consultation started on the introduction of a low-emission zone for the city centre and parts of the downtown area. Consultation process is divided into three stages. In the first stage of consultations, Municipality presented different variants of the zone, both in terms of the area and the
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

pace at which the most toxic vehicles would be eliminated from the zone. After this stage, officials prepared a draft zone for further consultation. The next stage will be "civic meeting". This is the second of three stages of public consultation on the zone. During the third stage, everyone will be able to give their opinion on the draft resolution on the low-emission zone

The selected examples of social innovations present a cross-section of different activities related to climate transformation. Building social capacity is an important aspect, and it is also important to use diverse forms of participation, adapted to different social groups, including marginalized groups. There are programmes and projects focusing on cooperation with different stakeholders.

Long-term impact and scale up of innovation activities will be provided through:

Increasing stakeholders motivation and commitment to climate transformation
Understand mutual expectations and interdependencies among stakeholder groups
Build trust and sectoral and trans-sectoral partnerships
Deepening knowledge and awareness of the climate transition (particularly about systemic dependencies)
Building shared ownership of the climate transition and the responsibilities and commitments of individual stakeholders.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

## Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

The presented first version of the action plan is part of an analysis of the sectors responsible for greenhouse gas emissions from the city area, and thus key in the process of reducing these emissions. In part, the proposed actions are a continuation of the city's ongoing programmes or activities identified in the SECAP, among others. However, achieving climate neutrality by 2030, understood as an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the base year (2022), requires acceleration and expansion of efforts in key sectors. That's why it's important to work with key stakeholders, including, in particular, electricity and heat production companies. It is also important to parameterize goals and an action plan at the national and regional levels. According to the NZC Neutrality Map, this is the first iteration of the action plan and the process involves continuous refinement, supplementation and revision during the implementation period therefore in this version, due to the lack of sufficient data, scale and scope of activities, the plan is general in nature and includes approximate emission reduction values and cost estimates. These data will be successively detailed.

The following activities will be undertaken as part of the work on the next iteration of the plan:

Updating the emission inventory - we plan to perform two more emission inventories for 2023 and 2024 so as to more precisely determine the scale of greenhouse gas emissions from the city area. To this end, we will use suggestions for corrections and improvements indicated in the 2022 inventory we currently have, but also conclusions from training on the use of the CIRIS programme. They include, among other things, suggestions to verify the possibility of obtaining emission factors specific to energy trading companies, to check the source of data on average fuel consumption and distance traveled within the municipality, to plan how to cooperate with the industrial sector. Accurate determination of emissions will allow better selection of scale and scope of activities.
SECAP update - we are planning to update the existing Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan for the City of Wroclaw (SECAP) in order to more precisely define and parametrize the municipality's activities in the pursuit of neutrality.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

5

We want to start reporting using the CDP / ICLEI portal so as to more effectively monitor the progress achieved.
Financial indicators and identification of the climate budget - further activities require cooperation with the city's financial divisions so as to more effectively raise funds for financing pro-climate actions, especially since increasingly often obtaining these funds from external sources requires determining their impact on emissions reductions or impact on climate change adaptation.
We plan to prepare an update of the Climate Change Adaptation Plan and build to a similar approach to that presented in the City Mission. Along with the Climate Change Adaptation Plan, we will proceed with the development of an ambitious Urban Greening Plan, which, in addition to the main goals of climate change adaptation and improving the quality of life in the city, will also be part of a plan to reduce residual emissions.
We will begin analysis and activities to identify ways to reduce residual emissions other than the use of greenery.
We will take steps toward working with private industry with the goal of working toward individual climate contracts or at least declarations of action related to reducing energy consumption, sourcing energy from renewable sources or reducing emissions in Scope 3.
We will continue to work with power and heating companies toward Decarbonisation of these sectors as key to the effectiveness of the Action Plan.
We will continue to cooperate at the local level in the work on the implementation plan of the Energy Strategy for Lower Silesia and at the national level in cooperation with the Ministry of Climate and Environment and the Ministry of Funds and Regional Development as key to the work on the National Plan for Energy and Climate by 2030, among others.
We will also, in cooperation at the national level and other Mission cities from Poland, build a platform for sharing knowledge and experience for other cities using the knowledge acquired during the work on the Climate Contract.

Other activities include:

identification of thermo-modernisation needs in municipal and private assets using, among other things, national data of the Integrated Low Emission Reduction System (ZONE), of which the Central Emission Inventory of Buildings (CEEB) is a part;
analysis of the potential for RES development, particularly in terms of photovoltaics (examining the potential of building roofs (especially large-scale buildings), parking lot canopies and shelters, and sites suitable for ground-mounted installations).
Analysis of the potential of municipal companies in terms of RES development;
mapping and analyzing the potential of waste heat sources. Future iterations must include a map of waste heat sources created jointly with stakeholders and an analysis of the potential for their use. Currently implemented one such project using heat from the municipal sewage system. To be studied and mapped, together with the city's stakeholders, are other sources of waste heat recovery, such as industrial processes, server rooms, cooling processes, transportation;
to take into account the phenomenon of energy poverty. This is necessary because it is the poorest or excluded people who will need the most systemic support and assistance in the energy transition process, both from the local government and at the national level;
analysis of the potential for electromobility development. To be studied is the potential for electromobility development: the possibility of developing a network of electric vehicle charging stations and hubs, and the possibility of increasing the number of bus lines served by electric buses.
plans for cooperation with stakeholders. Subsequent iterations of the document will include increasingly specific plans for actions and ways to support the implementation of the Municipal Climate City Contract obtained from key stakeholders. These will be developed
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

during the External Transition Team collaboration and individual agreements. This includes city stakeholders (city companies), private entities, NGOs, businesses, institutions.

Further work on solutions to systemic barriers is important. Representatives of the cities participating in the EC Mission and representatives of the Government of Poland (the most important ministries for the implementation of the CCC) are cooperating within the framework of the National Cooperation Platform, the purpose of which is to discuss ways of needed support (legislative, financial, technical, etc.) and necessary interventions at the national level, enabling the implementation of the CCC and elimination of systemic barriers. Meetings have already been held on funding sources for Decarbonisation activities and barriers to their use, and on the needs of local governments for support from the Government of the Republic. Another meeting is planned to discuss the draft National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030, and the solutions developed will be taken into account in subsequent iterations of the Action Plan.

Given the extensive thematic scope of the Climate Contract and the large number of activities to be performed but also the not too distant time for the implementation of these tasks (2030), it is proposed to review the progress of activities and possible iteration of the Contact in two-year cycles. This will allow monitoring of individual tasks and making necessary adjustments as new knowledge is gained and new skills are built especially in areas that need improvement.

In addition, the approved Action Plan, along with the other elements of the Climate Contract, will also be presented to city councilors as representatives of the citizens of Wroclaw.

# 1 Introduction

Ongoing climate change is the subject of many scientific studies, the results of which show that global warming directly affects human health, increases poverty and worsens people's living conditions, including access to water and food. Reducing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions to a level that will limit global warming should be done through measures leading to such as reducing energy intensity, minimising resource use, increasing the rate of decarbonisation and using $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ capture technologies. According to the IPCC data, stopping global warming at $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ will be possible by drastically reducing emissions by 2030. This will require a drastic reduction in fossil fuel consumption and its replacement by renewable energy, and the use of technologies and practices such as electrification of heating and transport, the use of hydrogen and sustainable biomass-based feedstocks, product substitution and carbon capture with its use and storage. Comprehensive action is also required, including strengthening multilevel governance, relating to the administration of public affairs, improving the capacity of institutions and supporting and developing policy instruments, technological innovation, the transfer and mobilisation of financial resources, and changes in people's behaviour and lifestyles. Action to limit global warming is linked to the other Sustainable Development Goals and should also be taken with these in mind.

Cities play a special role in the quest for climate neutrality; although they occupy only $4\%$ of the EU's land area, they are home to $75\%$ of its citizens. Furthermore, cities consume more than $65\%$ of the world's energy and account for more than $70\%$ of global $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions. Actions taken in urban centres to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase renewable energy production will be key to achieving the global climate goals described by documents adopted at international, national, regional and city level.

It is the local government units that are responsible for developing the documents shaping the local energy policy. The main document is the Assumptions to the Plan for Supply of Heat, Electricity and Gaseous Fuels in the Area of City of Wroclaw, which refers to the strategic and local planning documents, such as the Masterplan (according to the new regulations - the General Plan and Wroclaw City Strategy by 2030) and the Land use plans, which illustrate the spatial development of the city. These documents specify measures aimed at ensuring energy governance in the municipality and the development of the local economy and community.

Climate transformation encompasses both the economy and society. It aims to ensure energy security and environmental protection, in particular by taking measures to mitigate progressive climate change. It is therefore a complex process, requiring the implementation and coordination of a number of measures to achieve a target state of changing primary energy sources, combining social expectations (including environmental and climate concerns) with an economic growth strategy (GDP growth) and reindustrialisation. This sometimes requires reconciling conflicting objectives. This process should be carried out in a systematic way, based on innovative technologies. Unfortunately, as experts point out, there are still various barriers that hinder the energy transition. In addition to technical, economic or environmental barriers, barriers of a mental nature have been identified, resulting from habits and the desire to maintain the current energy model, which is why it is so important to conduct the energy transition process in a determined and consistent manner on the one hand, and in a sustainable and socially just manner on the other.

Wroclaw has for years been pursuing an ambitious vision of transforming the city into a carbon-free zone, where residents have access to secure, clean, sustainable and affordable energy. Wroclaw strives to become a conscious, resilient, responsible and future-ready city that protects and develops its natural capital and provides security and sustainable socio-economic development for its residents. To this end, the city is active in international forums and is an active member of European initiatives aimed at changing the energy and climate policies of cities, including the Covenant of Mayors on Climate and Energy or the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI). Wroclaw is also a signatory to the open letter of the Mayors of 58 cities in the Eurocities network addressed to the President of the European Council and the President of the Council of the EU in 2020, expressing the need to increase, with EU support, the reduction of emissions in urban areas to $65\%$ by 2030.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

A natural continuation of the activities carried out over the years was to join the Mission of 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities. Wroclaw has always remained in the vanguard of other cities, and is also a strong academic centre, which provides ideal potential for turning it into a centre of experimentation and innovation. On the basis of previous activities and projects, the prospect of setting a clear path to achieve climate neutrality, involving not only public entities reporting to the Mayor of Wroclaw, but all entities and residents to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions was an obvious choice. Joining the EU Cities Mission also provides an opportunity to obtain real substantive and financial support for planned activities, exchange of experience and prototyping of ideas, which will then be given an effect of scale. Wroclaw is the region's leader, so the experience gained in the process of determining the path of decarbonisation and building the transition team will be available to other cities in Lower Silesia, which has already been confirmed at the level of regional cooperation with substantive units subordinate to the Marshal of Lower Silesia Voivodeship. It is also important that both representatives of energy and heating companies, within the framework of the so-called decarbonisation table established by an ordinance of the Mayor of Wroclaw, as well as managers of multi-family buildings, developers, a coalition of Wroclaw universities, as well as non-governmental organisations and residents' self-governments, have joined the cooperation for the development and implementation of the Climate City Contract. This offers the prospect of jointly pursuing the stated goal of a climate-neutral city.

## Climate policy of Wroclaw

For years, Wroclaw has been pursuing a consistent climate policy, the framework for which is provided by the following strategic documents and resolutions of the Wroclaw City Council regarding mechanisms for supporting pro-climate measures (in the order of adoption):

|  Resolution No. LXXX/2093/24 of the Wroclaw City Council dated April 18, 2024, regarding the principles of granting targeted subsidies to individuals for tasks aimed at improving energy efficiency through the replacement of external windows (2024) | Provides subsidies for improving energy efficiency through window replacements, contributing to reduced energy consumption and emissions.  |
|  Resolution No. LXXX/2092/24 of the Wroclaw City Council dated April 18, 2024, regarding the principles of granting targeted subsidies for tasks aimed at air protection, involving the permanent change from solid fuel-based heating to low-emission heating (2024) | Provides subsidies to transition from solid fuel-based heating to low-emission heating, crucial for reducing local air pollution and emissions.  |
|  Resolution No. LXXX/2095/24 of the Wroclaw City Council dated April 18, 2024, regarding the principles of granting targeted subsidies for tasks involving the installation of systems utilising renewable energy sources for electricity generation and energy storage systems (2024) | Provides subsidies for renewable energy systems, promoting clean energy generation and reducing reliance on fossil fuels in Wroclaw.  |

Based on the prepared strategic documents, urban policies and action plans, as well as the accompanying incentive and support tools, the following activities, among others, were implemented:

Replacement of heat sources using solid fuels (coal and its derivatives) in single- and multi-family buildings, with environmentally friendly, lower-emission systems based on district heating, electricity, gas or heat pumps, classified as renewable energy sources. Wroclaw has been supporting residents in the process of eliminating coal-fired stoves with a system of municipal subsidies since 2014, while since 2019 it has been implementing 'the Change the Furnace' programme offering a whole range of support instruments, both financially and in the form of energy consulting and information and education activities, to raise the environmental awareness of Wroclaw's residents regarding the energy efficiency of the buildings they use. Between 2019 and 2023 alone, more than 14,000 high-emission coal-fired stoves were eliminated in Wroclaw.

The implementation of the so-called 'Small RES Programme', under which municipal institutions are equipped with renewable energy installations, has resulted in a successive increase in the number of such installations in Wroclaw every year. As a standard, newly constructed municipal buildings already meet sustainable building standards and are equipped with photovoltaics, green walls and roofs and rainwater management systems. In addition, the facilities of municipal companies are also being equipped with renewable energy installations from other financial resources. The most spectacular example is the photovoltaic farm in the car park of the municipal stadium, which produces energy to meet 50% of the needs of the Wroclaw Stadium company (Tarczynski Arena Wroclaw).
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Thanks to the system of property tax exemptions for investing own resources in RES, we are seeing a surge in RES in Wroclaw. Between 2019 and 2023 alone, exemptions of PLN 29,296,951.83 were granted, which illustrates the scale of the measures. Around 1,500 installations were created in this way.

An agreement to establish an energy cluster between the City of Wroclaw and the rectors of all Wroclaw universities is planned to be signed later in October this year. This is an innovative approach across Poland and a direct result of Wroclaw's participation in the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission.

Cooperation between the City and energy and district heating companies under the so-called Decarbonisation Table. The state-owned district heating company KOGENERACJA S.A., which supplies district heat to the residents of Wroclaw, plans to modernise generation capacity by 2028, replacing coal fuel with gas and heat pumps. Thanks to close cooperation with the city within the framework of the aforementioned partnership, a common direction has been given to the decarbonisation goals resulting from Wroclaw's participation in the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, and a high priority has been given to supporting investments to modernise the city's district heating generation sources.

Implementation by FORTUM Power and Heat Polska Sp. z o.o., a distributor of district heating in Wroclaw, and Municipal Water and Sewerage Company, of the innovative WROMPA project to recover heat from wastewater. The second-largest heat pump in Europe has been installed on one of the sewage collectors. Implementation of the project will make it possible to provide 5% of Wroclaw's demand for district heating.

Development of the public transport network, including replacement of the bus fleet with vehicles that meet the highest emission standards and electric vehicles. At the moment, the Municipal Transport Company is also in the process of testing hydrogen vehicles. Tram lines are being intensively developed, with two new tram lines built and another two designed in the last five years alone. It was also possible to sign an agreement on the development of agglomeration railways with the Marshal of the Voivodship, which enables Wroclaw residents to travel by rail within the administrative borders of the city using a public transport ticket. Travelling by rail is the most desirable means of public transport for the inhabitants, which is why more than 90% of the tramway tracks in Wroclaw are segregated routes in order to increase the comfort and shorten the travel time for passengers, thus increasing the attractiveness of public transport in relation to travel by individual transport.

Developing a network of park and ride facilities in close proximity to train stations and tram terminals to reduce the number of cars entering the city centre.

In line with the Sustainable Mobility Policy, a walking and cycling programme is also being implemented to increase the share of walking and cycling trips. Particularly desirable is the development of so-called 'green ways', which not only enables contact with nature during walking and cycling trips, but also increases the thermal comfort of traffic participants on hot days.

Development of green areas and implementation of the blue-green infrastructure and rainwater and snowmelt management strategy. The accessibility rate of green areas within 300 m of the place of residence is currently 84% in Wroclaw and 94.6% in the city centre, and has been rising steadily over the past few years. Bearing in mind the need to reduce the effect of the urban heat island, the 'Green Revolution' programme is being implemented, involving the protection and enhancement of the potential of existing greenery and areas of natural value, the creation of new green areas, the implementation of high-growth greenery planting in

road lanes (Green Arterials) and the implementation of unsealing (Grey to Green). These are activities ranked very high in the hierarchy of needs and expectations of Wroclaw's residents.

By joining the European Commission's 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, Wroclaw is continuing and strengthening its efforts to date by setting a clear objective. The work on the Climate City Contract makes it possible to build a transition team, parameterise emissions levels and address specific tasks to specific stakeholders according to their contribution to emissions. Participation in the Cities Mission also means building a multi-level partnership at city, regional and national level. Given that the public sector only accounts for 7% of emissions in Wroclaw, the involvement of other stakeholders is crucial. In addition, within the 55% of emissions from buildings, the energy and district heating sector accounts for the vast majority, so the cooperation established within the framework of the so-called Decarbonisation table with utility managers, most of which are state-owned companies that implement national policy objectives, is an absolute basis for the success of achieving the set targets.

Participation in the Cities Mission also has an educational dimension. In the stereotypical approach, the vast majority of challenges and tasks are addressed to the local government, which in the case of the climate transition plays a key role as a coordinator of the process, but is nevertheless not directly responsible for the investment processes that need to be undertaken in the energy sector, in heating, in increasing the energy efficiency of residential buildings, of which only 9% are owned by the city, in the decarbonisation of transport or industry, etc. Thus, the reversal of thinking from 'do' to 'let's do' is a very important turning point that, thanks to the joint work on the climate city contract, has been initiated, and the 'climate partnership' that has been established with local business, the academic sector and residents, is an absolute precedent in relation to previous actions and processes.

Last but not least, a Polish coalition of five cities participating in the Mission was built: Krakow, Lodz, Rzeszow, Warsaw and Wroclaw. From the outset, the cities decided to appear in a network in order to support each other not only in building climate city contracts, but above all in exchanging experience, jointly building partnerships and support at national level and representing Poland at European level. It may be side-tracked by official documents, but cooperation within the Cities Mission has resulted in sincere, cordial relations, which directly translate into a very good flow of information, joint application for European funds and support in the daily challenges towards climate-neutral local homelands.

# 2 Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

On the basis of the strategic documents on climate and energy adopted by the Wroclaw City Council, Wroclaw declares that it will achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. However, in view of the worsening climate crisis and the challenges arising from the energy crisis caused by the armed conflict in Ukraine, it is necessary to accelerate action in this regard, hence Wroclaw's participation in the Mission of Climate- Neutral and Smart Cities and the effort made to set a path for reducing GHG emissions by  $80\%$  by 2030.

The simulations performed in the economic model show that such a scenario is possible, but it must be borne in mind that it is highly dependent on the implementation of national policies and on the actions taken by energy and heating companies (state-owned companies), private entities and residents themselves (in terms of improving the energy efficiency of the buildings they use), as the broadly defined municipality only account for  $7\%$  of all emissions.

In parallel with the work on the CCC and the economic model, a roadmap for achieving climate neutrality for Wroclaw is being developed on behalf of the Climate and Energy Division of the Municipality of Wroclaw, presenting three scenarios for reducing GHG emissions: 1) a continuation scenario, 2) an achievable scenario and 3) a progressive scenario.

The aim of the document is not only to gather information on generated emissions, describe opportunities and constraints resulting from municipal, regional and national policies, but also to
#

Climate-Neutrality Commitments

#

analyse the cost-effectiveness of decarbonisation measures taken vs. the expected environmental effect.

The measures described in the CCC cover the entire area of the city within its administrative boundaries. We do not make any substantive or personal exclusions here. One of the added values of this document is precisely the fact that it is an integration of all the processes taking place in the city and overturns the stereotypical approach limiting itself only to the formal authority of the mayor. With such an approach, the goal set in the Cities Mission would not be achievable. Only a comprehensive approach and multi-level cross-sectoral partnership give the initiative a chance to succeed.

The basis for parameterising emissions within a city is an inventory carried out in accordance with the 'Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories. An Accounting and Reporting Standard for Cities' (GPC guidelines). The inventory principles according to the GPC are in line with the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, making it possible to transfer the results of the inventory to the level of the national GHG emission inventory performed for the UNFCCC. They incorporate the guidance provided in the guidebook 'How to develop a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP)'.

The inventory shows that  $55\%$  of GHG emissions in the Wroclaw area originate from buildings. These emissions include emissions from the production of heat and electricity. These processes are the responsibility of state-owned companies in Wroclaw, which are outside the direct authority of the Mayor of Wroclaw. As far as building ownership is concerned,  $91\%$  of these are privately owned, so once again, multi-level cooperation at city, regional and national level, as well as cross-sectoral partnerships and transition teams, should be emphasised.

![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)
Figure 2. The figure shows GHG by sector. The buildings sector has the highest emissivity.

Among the key benefits that Wroclaw sees in its participation in the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission are:

# 3 Strategic priorities

On the basis of the emission structure from the GHG inventory and the analyses within the economic model, it can be concluded that in Wroclaw the key activities are in 3 areas:

) electricity and heat production,
) renovation of the building stock,
) and in transport,

an additional area is:

) adaptation to climate change through the development of blue-green infrastructure and the protection of existing greenery and the unsealing of paved surfaces to minimise the urban heat island effect.

For electricity and heat production, the necessary measures concern:

Decarbonisation of energy production (in the case of Wroclaw, this is produced in a cogeneration system as electricity and heat). This means, as a first step, switching to gaseous fuel from the currently used hard coal. This process has already partly started (one of the power and heat and power plant has switched to gas and the main source is in the process of designing its reconstruction). In the next stage, it will be possible to switch to decarbonised gases or large-scale renewables.

Decarbonisation of individual heat sources - furnace replacement associated with air quality improvements is slowly coming to an end. Unfortunately, in many cases, for technical reasons, the replacement consisted of the installation of gas cookers, which will require further measures in the future (e.g. installation of heat pumps). The process of replacing coal cookers will be completed by 2028. Between 2019 and 2023, 14,000 coal-fired cookers were successfully removed as part of measures coordinated by the City of Wroclaw. According to estimates, around 5,600 will still remain at the end of 2024.

Production of electricity from renewable sources, together with its storage:

by residents, entrepreneurs, municipal companies (for their own needs and, after changes in regulations, as part of civic energy),
within cooperatives/communities/energy clusters,
construction of large-scale photovoltaic farms (in Wroclaw, due to the high urbanisation of the area and spatial and social conflicts, the use of wind energy is not possible unless new, less invasive technologies emerge, while the potential of water energy is partially exploited and there is no prospect of increasing it), therefore it is important to strengthen cooperation with the municipalities of the Wroclaw Functional Area for low-emission energy solutions, air protection programmes and building energy security.

Energy from waste sources - wastewater, server rooms, production and storage halls, shopping centres.

In this area, it is crucial to replace fossil energy sources in the production of electricity and heat with renewable or low-carbon sources. A key action in this area is to change the energy mix in the national energy system (NPS) therefore, at the local level, it is important to cooperate strongly with state-owned energy companies in the process of shifting from fossil fuels to low-carbon fuels (e.g. natural gas as a transition fuel), and subsequently based on renewable sources (e.g. biogas, green hydrogen, nuclear energy, large-scale heat pumps, geothermal energy).

An important element of system efficiency is also the modernisation of transmission and distribution networks so that they are adapted to the dynamic development of the producer market and distributed energy production installations.

The district heating system - in Wroclaw functions in a cogeneration system so the decarbonisation of electricity production will also cause changes in this system, too. Also in this case, heat production is the responsibility of state-owned enterprises, while heat distribution is the responsibility of a private company. Cooperation activities in the context of decarbonisation of heat and energy in a cogeneration system have already been undertaken. A Team for decarbonisation of the district heating system has been established, which includes representatives of the key actors involved in this process. The necessary discussions to carry out this activity are taking place within the team.

Investments in the extraction of waste heat from the sewage network are being developed in this case (one investment has already been made in this area covering about 5% of the heat demand).

An innovative approach will also be the wider use of waste energy sources, e.g. from the water and sewage system or from industry. A very important element of the transformation is also the development of an efficient and effective energy storage system for both electricity and heat.

At the local level, it is important to continue the development of renewable energy installations both on municipal facilities, public utilities (continuation of the Small RES programme for public facilities initiated in 2022) and on the facilities and sites of municipal companies and entities. RES generation will be an important element in the pursuit of climate neutrality of municipal companies such as. Municipal Transport Company, Municipal Water and Sewage Company, Ecosystem Sp. z o.o.

The programme of tax exemptions for residents and entrepreneurs for the implementation of RES installations will be continued, as well as the modified Kawka Plus programme, under which it is possible to receive a subsidy for the replacement of a high-emission heat source with a low-emission installation. A subsidy programme has also been launched for the installation of renewable energy sources: photovoltaic panels, micro wind installations or energy storage. The city's energy advisors suggest how to take advantage of the financial programmes and which solutions are worth investing in.

The key stakeholders in this sector are:

State-owned energy companies - energy and heat producers. The rate of decarbonisation of the district heating plants supplying the city with energy depends, to a large extent, on the rate of decarbonisation of the entire city.
Energy distributors - Wroclaw's power grid requires modernisation and adaptation to new functions related to the development of prosumer energy and the need for energy storage; this means the introduction of modern energy transmission management systems on which depends, among other things, the profitability of investing in renewable energy sources in the city.
Government of the Republic of Poland and relevant ministries - decarbonisation plans of energy companies depend largely on national level policies, with the State Treasury being the main shareholder in these companies. Also important are legal regulations on RES and the prosumer market in terms of, among other things, favourable cost accounting for energy production from RES or regulations providing opportunities for the development of civic energy in cities.

For the renovation of buildings, the necessary actions concern:

Renovation and thermo-modernisation of residential buildings - in the municipal resources and in particular in the private sector (both individual buildings and communities or cooperatives), in this case the conclusions of the NEEST pilot project carried out within the framework of the Cities Mission can be particularly valuable, which will indicate the most
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

beneficial ways of effective, economically efficient and socially acceptable modernisation of the housing stock with regard to different types of residential and non-residential buildings, these recommendations can be used by the inhabitants themselves but also by the regional and central authorities in the context of planning financial and technical support programmes. The city has just launched a new programme for the renovation of historic tenements, 'Tenement returns' under which 100 buildings and 70 courtyard interiors will be renovated by 2029; a larger scale depends on obtaining external funding.

Renovation and thermo-modernisation of non-residential buildings - this generally concerns private buildings - services or production facilities, therefore the city has established cooperation with some of these entities and we hope that they will undertake actions towards reducing energy demand and strive for neutrality. In the case of municipal/public/utility buildings, necessary works will also be carried out, e.g. in schools or kindergartens (thermal modernisation, energy management, energy production from RES).

Energy-positive new buildings - new buildings, both municipal and private, will have to meet certain standards, e.g. in accordance with the so-called the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) adopted by the European Commission, which is why the city has entered into dialogue and cooperation with the housing development community. The city also has a social housing company TBS Wroclaw Sp. z o.o., so it is important that new residential and non-residential buildings have a positive energy balance or are zero-emission.

The priority of these measures is to reduce the inhabitants' need for heat and electricity. Replacing fossil sources with renewable sources in the same amount may be difficult, but it is also not justifiable in terms of energy efficiency. This is why reducing energy consumption is so important. Besides, the energy transition will result in costs that may be reflected in energy prices in Poland, so thermo-modernisation is necessary to reduce energy poverty. Most of the building stock in Wroclaw consists of buildings with low energy classes and often not meeting any energy efficiency standards. This results in significant consumption of heat in particular and the need to scale up the energy system.

Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings assumes primarily the thermo-modernisation of private, cooperative buildings and those belonging to enterprises and institutions not associated with the local government, but also the municipal stock of residential and commercial buildings.

In the coming years, the city will continue the thermo-modernisation of public buildings and residential buildings with the aim of increasing their energy efficiency and focus on creating a system of incentives and support systems for private building owners to undertake such actions. The city has an identified pool of investment projects related to improving the energy efficiency of residential buildings in the municipal housing stock and public buildings. It also runs programmes to support residents in thermal modernisation measures, but these need to be strengthened.

An important element in accelerating the wave of renovation is also expert advice for residents both on the technical aspects of the investments to be made and on the possibilities of using municipal, regional and national funding for thermal modernisation measures. At present, these programmes are widely dispersed and based on different accessibility criteria.

In the case of new buildings, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation with the development community as the main player in the city's real estate market and to realise public investments in the formula of zero- or almost zero-emission buildings, using heat recovery, mechanical ventilation or energy production from RES.

The process of upgrading the city's lighting with LED luminaires, which will significantly reduce energy consumption, will also continue, as will further action on the issue of recovering and using waste heat from production processes, cooling systems, server rooms, wastewater and other sources within the city.

The main stakeholders in this sector are:
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Government of the Republic of Poland, Regional Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management and other operators of financing programmes - deep thermo-modernisation of buildings is associated with enormous costs (for the municipality's own investments or financial support for residents), hence the key role here is to ensure adequate financing for local authorities from external sources.
Science sector - reducing the demand for primary energy requires a continuous search for and implementation of innovative solutions in the form of: ways to reduce consumption, energy recovery methods, ways to use waste energy, efficient storage of energy surpluses.
Municipal companies and manufacturing, trading and service companies - these are energy-intensive entities with a high potential for reducing consumption and using waste energy.
Construction and renovation companies and cooperatives and housing associations - the construction industry and building administrators have a major influence on the development and implementation of new energy standards in new and renovated buildings. Without their involvement, it will be difficult to carry out effective measures in this area.
Residents, especially in the area of maintaining a fair energy transition and protecting vulnerable groups.

For mobility and transport, the necessary actions concern:

Development of public transport - trams - buses - railways - infrastructure investments - new tram lines, new rail stops and interchanges, increase in frequency, exploiting the potential of railways
Encouraging and inducing the choice of public transport for moving around the city - appropriate transport policy (paid parking zones, park and ride), clean transport zone, residential zones, increased accessibility to transport (interchanges, network of connections), common agglomeration ticket
Decarbonisation of rolling stock - purchase of low- or zero-emission rolling stock (electric buses, hydrogen, urban fleet), increase in the share of trams and rail in public transport (new rolling stock, depot, new rail connections - agglomeration trains), new technologies (e.g. asynchronous engines, energy recovery from braking), charging stations - electric and hydrogen
Individual transport - restrictions (e.g. paid parking zone, residential zone, clean transport zone), electrification, electromobility (charging stations)
Walking and cycling - cycling programme including the development of greenways, pedestrian standards and accessibility in public spaces (in this case, greening of streets can be added as an incentive to 'walk' around the city).

The most significant action in this sector is the reduction in the scale of individual car transport combined with the development of public and other non-car transport and the electrification of both individual and freight transport as well as public transport.

Transport is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the Wroclaw area, after construction and stationary energy, accounting for almost $31\%$ of all emissions and a source of air pollution. These emissions are mainly due to road transport, with individual car transport accounting for the largest share. Therefore, key actions should concern the development of low-emission public transport and other alternative ways of moving around the city that are attractive, comfortable, physically accessible and affordable, and safe for people using individual car transport.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Wroclaw is systematically and consistently developing public transport based on tramway, bus and rail transport. This includes both improving travel conditions on the existing network by modernising it and building new transport corridors. It is also replacing the rolling stock with more energy-efficient and low- or zero-emission vehicles. Hydrogen-powered buses are also being tested. Alongside the development of public transport, a system of cycle routes is also being developed, including green cycle routes as alternative transport corridors away from main roads. The transport workload is also being increased in cooperation with the agglomeration railway company, Lower Silesian Railways, which is a company under the management of the voivodeship's local authorities. The use of public transport on a larger scale is also to be encouraged by new P&amp;R car parks in the created interchanges, an increase in the number of safe and accessible stops, and the development of environmentally friendly (green tracks and green stops) transport infrastructure.

A measure affecting the reduction of emissions from individual car transport will be the development of electromobility. This means building, together with private partners, an appropriate charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. Shared transport will also be promoted.

The main stakeholders, in this sector are:

Government of the Republic of Poland, the Regional Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management and other operators of funding programmes - investments in public transport are costly, hence the key role here is to ensure adequate funding for local authorities from external sources. Electromobility development, on the other hand, requires support through, for example, appropriate tax reliefs or subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles.
Regional government authorities - as the agglomeration rail transport operator and owner of the railway company, Lower Silesian Railways, are a key player in the development of rail transport and tariff integration at the city and functional area level.
Companies - operators of vehicle charging stations, through which appropriate infrastructure can be developed and maintained to encourage the purchase and use of electric vehicles.
Municipal companies - responsible for the development of walking, cycling and public transport networks.
Residents - the issues of reducing car traffic and changing transport habits are socially sensitive topics, and therefore the residents of the areas affected by the changes will be involved each time in the process of consulting specific solutions.

Adapting to climate change by developing blue-green infrastructure and protecting existing greenery and unsealing paved surfaces to minimise the urban heat island effect.

Blue-green infrastructure and climate change adaptation measures have less impact on direct emission reductions but are important in terms of reducing energy consumption, quality of life, climate change adaptation, minimising the urban heat island effect and can affect changing transport behaviour.

Green areas in the city need to be protected from excessive urban pressure, to be restored, to increase their value in terms of providing ecosystem services, and to increase the area of biologically active area in places where it is possible and most needed.

Within the framework of the protection and development of the blue-green infrastructure, the city will, among other things by means of spatial planning, influence the density of urban development in such a way as to protect areas of natural value and ensure the sustainability of the development (this is particularly important in highly urbanised areas as well as newly created development areas). The compact city to be created must take into account the issue of adaptation to climate change as the greatest civilisational challenge of the coming years.

Maintaining and developing blue-green infrastructure is very important both in terms of sequestration of surplus carbon dioxide, as well as adaptation activities, increasing the city's resilience to the effects of climate change and increasing access to recreational areas for residents.

Planned measures include: protecting natural areas from further urbanisation pressures (thus ensuring the protection and restoration of areas of natural value, e.g. the creation of a reserve on irrigation fields), planting trees and shrubs, increasing biologically active areas and unsealing impervious surfaces, expanding small retention facilities.

It is also important to develop appropriate standards for the shaping of space and the realisation of investments in the communes of the Wroclaw Functional Area for the purpose of maintaining and strengthening the continuity of the blue-green infrastructure system, in particular concerning the protection of green areas, river corridors, retention and strengthening biodiversity. One of the strategic elements is to proceed with the elaboration of a supra-local development strategy for the Wroclaw Functional Area.

These measures will be implemented both through direct investments by the city, such as the continuation of the Green Revolution programme and through the greening of streets and the creation of green arteries along traffic routes, the planting of trees as part of the existing GROWinWRO programme, the extension of green tracks, the development of green pedestrian and cycle routes.

The 'Green Lungs of Wroclaw' programme has also been planned for the coming years, under which additional parks and urban forests, as well as squares and green areas as places for rest and recreation among the greenery.

Actions to deconcrete courtyards and squares, the so-called 'Grey to Green' programme, will also be continued and further developed. A symbolic project in this area, which echoed throughout Poland, was the greening of an inner-city square with a bunker and underground car park, replacing the concrete with almost 200 trees and 60,000 other plants, showing developers, among others, that planting tall greenery on the ceiling of an underground car park is possible.

Supporting measures are the implementation and enforcement of greenery management standards (greenery protection standards in investment processes, greenery maintenance standards).

The city also encourages residents, cooperatives, housing communities, entrepreneurs to unseal pavements, plant greenery and set up small retention facilities on areas belonging to them, through education (e.g. Good Practice Guides for rainwater management in urbanised and road areas) and support programmes - expert advice from city entities and grant programmes for small retention facilities, as well as a civic budget.

# 4 Process and underlying principles

Wroclaw's participation in the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission was a very important step in legitimising the systemic approach to the city's climate ambitions and giving them a high priority not only within the municipality, but also among external stakeholders.

Building a strong internal as well as external mandate as well as precisely parameterising both the challenges of generated GHG emissions and the needs for their reduction was a huge challenge. However, in retrospect, the effort put into the more than two-year process of preparing the climate contract is judged to have been valuable and desirable.

The city has been implementing decarbonisation and sustainability activities for many years. For a long time, however, these were bottom-up activities, implemented by units, municipal entities and companies without systemic coordination. As a result, the city's resources and funds allocated for this

purpose were not used optimally due to a lack of synergy and systemic planning. The plans and programmes created in the city were sectoral in nature.

# Wroclaw Transition Team

![img-24.jpeg](img-24.jpeg)
Figure 5. The scheme of local coalition during building the Wroclaw Transition Team (Net Zero Cities).

The first step in making urban actions for climate neutrality systemic was the establishment by the Mayor of Wroclaw, in October 2022, of the Municipal Mission Team. It is made up of representatives from all city departments, entities and companies, and meetings have a cyclical character to ensure an adequate flow of information and a platform for cross-sectoral cooperation.

At the same time, networking has continued outside of the office's structures with the academic community, developers, housing associations, NGOs and residents. In each of the communities, a leader was identified as the contact person and voice of his or her community.

It was very important to establish in June 2023 a partnership for the decarbonisation of the district heating system, the so-called decarbonisation table, which brought about unprecedented cooperation of energy companies, district heating companies, gas companies, the municipal water and sewerage company, urban investment and environmental services and urban planners in one body. The declaration of working together to decarbonise Wroclaw was of particular importance in the context of the fact that the decarbonisation of the energy and district heating systems is of vital importance to the success of achieving the target of reducing  $80\%$  of Wroclaw's GHG emissions.

An absolute breakthrough in contacts with Wroclaw companies was the Mission 1.5 Degree Wroclaw conference organised in May 2024, during which companies were invited to sign a declaration of cooperation to achieve the objectives set out in the Mission and the CCC. The response and openness of Wroclaw companies to cooperation with the city exceeded our expectations and are good prognosis for the future.

As part of building regional support for the intentions expressed in the CCC, a cooperation agreement on the climate neutrality of the city and region was signed with the Institute for Territorial Development - a structure at voivodship level corresponding to the Department of Strategy and Sustainable Development of the Municipality of Wroclaw. The Institute of Territorial Development prepared the Lower Silesia Energy Strategy adopted by the Board of the Lower Silesian Voivodship in 2022, which indicates the directions of the region's energy development, taking into account the current challenges of climate change and the necessary energy transition activities to be carried out in line with European Union policies.

The parties are planning to develop cooperation in which other municipalities in the Lower Silesia region will benefit from Wroclaw's experience in determining the city's decarbonisation path.

On the governmental level, on the other hand, thanks to the cooperation within the coalition of five Polish cities, it was possible during a six-month workshop to not only gain the support of the Ministry of Climate and Environment for the measures included in the CCC of Wroclaw and the city's climate ambitions, but also to build a platform for cooperation, without which the implementation of the goals described in this document would not be possible.

![img-27.jpeg](img-27.jpeg)
Figure 8. Meeting on the Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" - Ministry of Climate and Environment (Gov.pl).

From the outset, the work on the CCC envisaged an iterative character of the document, especially in view of the fact that the broadly defined municipality is responsible for only  $7\%$  of all GHG emissions within the city, with the remaining  $93\%$  of emissions resulting from the activities of state-owned enterprises, private companies and residents. Therefore, the transition team that has been built up is crucial to further action. We envisage close cooperation with all stakeholder groups in order to monitor progress in the implementation of the actions set out in the CCC, to coordinate with each other and to create synergies.

The expectation that the Municipality of Wroclaw will play a coordinating role in the whole process is already apparent, which is perfectly understandable and natural. As soon as work on the CCC and the climate neutrality roadmap for Wroclaw has been completed, an update of the SECAP and the Climate Change Adaptation Plan is planned, so that all documents are consistent with each other. Both the SECAP and the Climate Change Adaptation Plan are adopted by resolutions of the Wroclaw City Council, which means that they are given a high profile and continue to dedicate municipal financial resources to the actions described in the CCC.
Climate-Neutrality Commitments

Finally, it should be mentioned that within the framework of the ongoing work on the Strategy for Wroclaw 2050, issues related to climate neutrality and energy security have been given a very high priority and elevated to the level of strategic objectives, which will mean that the progress of the implementation of the set targets will have to be monitored annually.

# Memorandum of cooperation on projects and actions bringing European cities and regions closer to climate neutrality

Memorandum of Cooperation between the Lower Silesian Voivodeship - Institute for Territorial Development and the City of Wroclaw - Sustainable Development Department in the framework of projects and undertakings bringing European cities and regions closer to achieving climate neutrality

We, the undersigned representatives of the Self-Government of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, and representatives of the City of Wroclaw, express our intention to cooperate in the implementation of projects contributing to the achievement of climate neutrality.

The Lower Silesian Voivodeship, represented by the Institute of Territorial Development, is involved in the preparation of the "PEARL-LIFE PL" project, which aims to accelerate the implementation of the "Energy Strategy of Lower Silesia." According to the strategic direction set forth in the aforementioned Strategy, the priority is to achieve the climate neutrality of Lower Silesia by 2050.

The City of Wroclaw, represented by the Sustainable Development Department, is participating in the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, which aims to achieve climate neutrality of selected European Union cities by 2030, as well as transform these centres into centres of experimentation and innovation, so that the entire European Union can achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

We recognise the synergistic effects of the projects and ventures we implement, as necessary in achieving the goals set both at the city and regional levels. Through joint efforts we aim to create a platform for the exchange of knowledge, experience and best practice useful to the city, the region as a whole and other interested European and national partners. We also declare our willingness to undertake joint action in order to implement the results of our projects on:

support in accelerating the decarbonisation of conventional energy sources,
strengthening the activity of clusters, cooperatives and energy communities, aimed at harnessing local potential,
developing institutional and competence capacities,
increasing the use of renewable energy sources and energy storage technologies, and developing civic energy,
developing access to climate-neutral investment funding and reducing energy poverty,
implementing solutions for zero-emission transport systems,
developing development concepts and plans, including urban planning projects for energy-efficient solutions and climate-neutral districts,
building an environment of cooperation, awareness-raising and increasing the involvement of: citizens, institutions, NGOs, entrepreneurs in carrying out activities to achieve climate neutrality.

# The urban dimension of climate policy

Together we will strive for Poland's climate neutrality. One of the biggest challenges on the way to achieving this goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urbanised areas, where the life activities of most of the country's inhabitants are concentrated. At the same time, cities are centres of innovation, where new and increasingly effective solutions are being sought.

The transformation will not take place without close cooperation between the Ministry of Climate and Environment and local governments. We therefore declare that we will take effective and partnership-based measures embedded in the priorities of climate policy, ensuring sustainable development of cities.

Mr.
Jacek Sutryk
Mayor of the City of Wrocław

Dear Mayor of the City of Wrocław,

This is the letter of appreciation for the City of Wrocław for undertaking efforts to develop the Climate City Contract.

The Ministry of Climate and Environment recognizes the urgent need for actions to be taken to achieve climate neutrality, mitigate the effects of climate change, and accelerate the efforts towards a sustainable future of cities. Therefore, we support the initiative of the City of Wrocław, which aims to develop and implement the Climate City Contract.

The aforementioned Climate City Contract of the City of Wrocław is closely related to national actions undertaken to implement international climate commitments. We strongly believe that we can accelerate progress on our common goals and create significant changes at the local and national level by supporting and participating in these commitments.

The Ministry of Climate and Environment coordinates the implementation of the National Energy and Climate Plan until 2030. The National Plan is a strategic document developed by the Member States of the European Union, in which they define the goals and means for achieving the so-called EU climate and energy targets. In particular, this concerns the aim of climate neutrality in 2050. The plan includes strategies for: reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the contribution of energy from renewable sources, improving energy efficiency and other actions aimed at limiting the impact of human activity on climate change.

The National Energy and Climate Plan until 2030 presents objectives and targets as well as policies and actions in 5 fields of the energy union, i.e.: energy security, internal energy market, energy efficiency, decarbonisation and research, innovation, and competitiveness. The Ministry of Climate and Environment approves all actions of the City of Wrocław defined in the Climate City Contract that will contribute to these goals.

In addition, the Ministry of Climate and Environment expresses its willingness to jointly overcome challenges and conduct a permanent dialogue in order to systematically increase climate resilience of the cities and help them to achieve climate neutrality. The Ministry of Climate and Environment will also make efforts to build a cooperation platform involving other ministries, using the previous experience of the Ministry and local governments participating in the Mission of 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030.

Your sincerely
