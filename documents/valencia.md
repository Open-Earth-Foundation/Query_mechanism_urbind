# Introduction

At the crucial moment in the global response to climate-related emergencies, the European Union is committed to leading climate action and has set the targets and legislation to achieve it. Thus, the European Union must reduce its emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by mid-century. In this context, cities have a key role to play, both to accelerate the decarbonisation process and to ensure a fair and equitable transformation that contributes to the well-being of society as a whole.

Cities, despite occupying only about 3% of the earth's surface, generate more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions and consume more than 65% of global energy. And it is important that they act as centres of experimentation and innovation in the transition to climate neutrality.

The European Union Mission "100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030" aims to support the transformation of cities to accelerate compliance with the Paris Agreement, and to be both a catalyst and driver for the implementation of the European Green Deal, and a demonstrator that it is possible to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

In Spain, on 8 September 2021, the Government of Spain and the City Councils of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville and València signed the Declaration "Climate-neutral Cities in 2030" (annexed to this Climate City Contract), as a boost to the commitments and initiatives of the signatory cities and as support from the government for the transformation of these cities to achieve climate neutrality and improve their resilience. Following this path, on December 13, the City Councils of Soria, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza adhered to the Declaration.

In addition, on 15 September 2021, the Senate Plenary approved a motion urging the Government to promote the climate neutrality of cities within the framework of the European Cities Mission. The motion recognises the fundamental role of cities in the response to the climate emergency and highlights the opportunity to accelerate the necessary and cross-cutting changes so that cities are climate-neutral by 2030. It also values that the different territorial administrations promote and facilitate the climate neutrality of Spanish cities through their incorporation into the Cities Mission and through the development of transformation projects.

In this regard, on 25 November 2021, the Cities Mission launched a call for expression of interest addressed to European cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants interested in participating. Of the 377 that applied, 100 were selected from the EU-27, including the Spanish cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, València, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza.

The Mission Implementation Plan foresees that each of the 100 selected cities will develop a Climate City Contract adapted to its own reality, through a process of co-creation and in close collaboration with the whole of civil society and citizens, detailing the strategy for the deployment and monitoring of innovative and digital solutions to achieve climate neutrality; and enabling other cities to follow their example by 2050. This document thus constitutes a clear political commitment, not only to the European Commission and national, regional and local authorities, but also to the citizenship, and includes a comprehensive climate action plan in the different sectors, such as energy, buildings, waste management and transport, together with corresponding investment plans.

In this way, this document responds to the requirements of the European Cities Mission. It has been prepared by the city, with the participation of other public and private actors, and sets out plans to achieve climate neutrality.

In particular, it recognises that the Mission cannot succeed without being firmly anchored in the local community and garnering broad support. It therefore involves civil society, youth groups, cultural institutions and creative sectors, foundations, local media, small and medium-sized enterprises, private industry, trade unions, academia and research, and the public sector, among others, in their respective roles as decision-makers, users, consumers, producers and owners.

#

Furthermore, it integrates the city's own qualities and heritage, guaranteeing the local dimension of the transition to climate neutrality, but also its inclusive character, in line with the values of the New European Bauhaus (art/culture, sustainability, society). It fosters a sense of ownership and appropriation by the city's inhabitants and professional actors, showing that their unique contribution is relevant and that the fulfilment of this Climate City Contract will result in a better quality of life and a better environment for all.

On the other hand, it is configured in the framework of an iterative process, as a document that will be subject to monitoring and updating, both through the signing of addenda and other accession documents, thus bringing together other actors necessary for the city to achieve the established goal of climate neutrality. In particular, the commitments contained may be expanded or updated to effectively contribute to achieving climate neutrality in the city.

The document is divided into several parts: one related to the cities' commitment to achieve climate neutrality in the city; another concerning the institutional support and coordination of the different public administrations; another part concerning its monitoring and updating; and a final part comprising the annexes corresponding to the Climate Action Plan, the City Climate Investment Plan and the City Stakeholders and Commitments, which follow the models elaborated by NetZeroCities¹.

# Commitment of the city of València towards climate neutrality

## Introduction

Improving the lives of the people who live and interact in València and the legacy for future generations are the two main motivations for València to join the European Union's Cities Mission.

València has recently been named **European Green Capital 2024** thanks to the city's commitment to an ecological and just transition in its fight against climate change.

In recent years, the city of València has become one of the first European cities to adopt the European Mission to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, approving it in the Plenary Session of its City Council in February 2021 with the broad support of the political parties of both the government and the opposition. This broad consensus is known in València as the "València 2030 Climate Mission".

Certainly, this motivation and commitment to the European Cities Mission has been decisive in the recognition of València as European Green Capital for 2024 and also in the recent repeated acknowledgments as one of the most innovative European cities through the editions of the European Capital of Innovation in 2020 and 2022.

However, the city has not stopped here in its commitment and capacity for experimentation in city governance. València has promoted its "**València 2030 Urban Strategy**" which merges the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda, the Urban Agenda and the European Innovation Missions into a single framework for action. València has learned that they are two sides of the same coin and that they complement and need each other to ensure the desired impact. The València 2030 Climate Mission is incorporated into the heart of this urban strategy that articulates public policies and innovation to achieve a healthier, sustainable, shared, prosperous and entrepreneurial, creative and Mediterranean city. A friendly city where people want to live and feel proud to do so.

In this context and through the climate mission, València has reinforced its commitment to continue at the forefront of European action to mitigate and adapt to the climate emergency and to promote innovation aimed at actions that improve people's well-being, as well as to

collaborate and accelerate the implementation of solutions that produce social, economic and environmental benefits for urban transformation. These commitments include:

+ Join a process of urban transformation within the framework of the European Mission, with a commitment to collaborate and accelerate the implementation of solutions that promote equity and deliver social, economic and environmental benefits in our cities.

+ Approve goals and objectives, and design a roadmap to achieve the decarbonisation and ecological transition of the city of València, with a vision of climate justice.

+ Accelerate the implementation of the European Cities Mission and communicate the social value of urban transformation processes in partnership with citizens.

+ Coordinate and facilitate the incorporation of all stakeholders within the city and together with the Government of the Generalitat Valenciana and the Government of Spain towards common climate objectives, consisting of:

Achieving climate neutrality by 2030 as defined in the European Cities Mission and its implementation plan.
Reducing emissions in 2030 in the city in support of the commitment of the Valencian Community and Spain with the European Commission.
Sharing and transferring the learning and knowledge acquired with the rest of the cities and towns in Europe.
Developing and implementing transformative projects in cities with a commitment to involve all actors (private sector, academia, civil society, citizens and the media together with the different levels of government).
Deploying scientific research to analyse the feasibility and strengths of each city district in the decarbonisation process.
Being a European innovation pole city in the field of sustainability, digitalisation and just transition.

## Goal: Climate neutrality by 2030

The city of València has a strong and consensual-driven mandate towards climate neutrality that has been growing in scope and ambition over the years:

+ 2009: Signing of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy.

Climate City Contract - València
1

+ 2010: Approval of the Sustainable Energy Action Plan for the city of València (SEAP).
+ 2011: Approval of the València 2020 Climate Change Strategy.
+ 2014: Accession to the Covenant of Mayors for Climate Change Adaptation.
+ 2015: Accession to the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy.
+ 2018: Accession to Energy Cities.
+ 2019: Approval of the City of València's Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) which included a commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 40%, increase energy efficiency by 27%, use energy from renewable sources by 27% and increase resilience to climate change.
+ 2019: Approval of the Declaration of Climate Emergency whose commitments include the reduction of GHGs to reach net-zero no later than 2040 and if possible before 2035.
+ 2020: València becomes a member of the Energy Cities Board of Directors, a position it currently holds.
+ 2021: Accession to the Paris Declaration to keep global average temperature increase to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, pursue efforts to limit global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, decarbonisation by 2040s or earlier or by 2050 at the latest to limit global warming to 1.5°C and decarbonisation to 50% by 2030.

All this solid track record of commitments and action led the city of València and its City Council to:

+ Postulate its first mission through the approval in the City Council Plenary on 25 February 2021 of the València Neutral City Mission with the aim of achieving at least 3 climate-neutral neighbourhoods or towns in the city before 2030 by (and for) the citizens and within the context of the European Cities Mission.
+ Sign on 8 September 2021 together with the Government of Spain and the City Councils of Barcelona, Madrid, Seville the Declaration "Climate Neutral Cities in

Climate City Contract - València

", getting actively involved with CITIES 2030, the Collaboration Platform for the Climate Neutrality of Spanish Cities set up for the European Cities Mission.

+ Being chosen by the European Environment Agency as a pilot city to develop the use case for identifying synergies between the Urban Decarbonisation Mission and the Climate Adaptation Mission, in an action of coordination, development and joint evaluation of both missions, in which the Generalitat Valenciana also collaborates.

+ To be selected as a city for the two European innovation missions in the field of the fight against climate change: the CITIES Mission and the ADAPT Mission.

## València's ambition towards climate neutrality by 2030

Finally, and in the context of the 2022 European call for its Cities Mission, València updated its ambition and commitments in the City Council Plenary on 27 January 2022, following the European guidelines and recommendations. Once again, with a broad consensus between government and opposition, 31 of the 33 councillors of the City Council approved the València 2030 Climate Mission, thus reflecting the great ambition as a city towards climate neutrality in 2030 and towards adaptation to climate change, including its necessary social transition, in a context of unprecedented climate crisis in which, moreover, the Mediterranean arc is suffering its impacts with even greater intensity.

## València's ambition towards climate neutrality by 2030

Achievement of climate neutrality for scopes 1 and 2 of the European Cities Mission throughout the city of València by establishing a relationship between "lighthouse" districts and "follower" districts of the systemic transformation in the multiple Emission Impact Domains defined by our València 2030 Climate Mission:

+ Mobility and Transport
+ Energy
+ Economy and Industry
+ Renaturalisation, Biodiversity and Resilience
+ Housing and buildings
+ Urbanism and habitat
3

To make this ambition possible, we deploy smart, urban and metropolitan co-governance together with the city ecosystem acting transversally through the following **Systemic Action Domains** that act in an interconnected way:

+ Citizen and social involvement
+ Just social transition
+ Politics, funding and laws
+ Innovation and technology
+ The smart city and data
+ Social communication
+ Alliances and networks

Parallel to the action in the city's districts and neighbourhoods, the following deep and experimental transition demonstrators are established.

## The public universities of València:

Partnerships with the city's two universities to achieve climate neutrality on university campuses that will act as Living Labs for innovations and decarbonisation processes whose learning and results are scaled up to the city level:

+ The Polytechnic University of València
+ The University of València

## 3 areas of special interest for València:

+ The Port of València with its strategy of decarbonisation of port activity.
+ La Marina de València, as a hub of entrepreneurship and innovation that acts as a Living-Lab.
+ L’Horta de València, as a special protection area and producer of sustainable food for the city of València.

## 2 exemplary sectors of activity in València:

+ Tourism, with its Sustainable Tourism strategy.
+ Public Administration.

Finally, and as closing note related to mitigation, it is worth highlighting our commitment to trying to **achieve climate neutrality for scope 3 of the European mission throughout the city of València in 2040**, for which it will be essential to act with a special focus on the transition towards circularity of our economic and production model at all levels. It will also stress that the city of València has a firm commitment to sustainable and local food, one of its

Climate City Contract - València
Climate City Contract - València
4

priorities, and that it has a significant impact on these Scope 3 emissions. All this will be addressed from the "Economy &amp; Industry" emissions impact domain in order to achieve a circular and sustainable economic model in the city of València.

In addition, as mentioned above, the city of València has also been selected for the European Commission's ADAPT Mission together with the Regional Government of the Generalitat Valenciana. Thanks to the fact that the València 2030 Climate Mission includes the two European missions (cities and adaptation) within its scope, the areas of adaptation to climate change and its actions are addressed from the Emission Impact Domains of "Renaturalisation, Biodiversity and Resilience" and "Urbanism and Habitat".

## Lessons learnt

In this iterative process of building the Climate City Contract of the city of València, we have been able to extract lessons and conclusions that reinforce the idea that it is absolutely necessary and very beneficial to continue with the roadmap that will lead us towards climate neutrality by 2030.

### Lesson 1: Transformation needs to be accelerated.

According to the results of the economic model, the transformation of the current model (Business as Usual: hereafter BAU) needs to be accelerated. If it is not tackled with the necessary urgency, the projected emissions in 2030 will be approximately the same as in 2019. In other words, if the roadmap proposed by the València 2030 Urban Strategy and the Climate Mission is not implemented, the growth in the city's activity will offset the climate efficiency measures adopted and we will continue to produce the same emissions as in 2019, with the harmful effects on climate change and people's lives that this entails.

### Lesson 2: The main causes of the problem.

On the other hand, an analysis of these emissions in 2019 and their projection in the BAU 2030 scenario leads to the conclusion that, in València, the sectors that have the greatest impact percentually on these emissions are electricity production (29% in 2019 and 31% in the BAU2030), transport (33% in 2019 and 26% in the BAU2030) and also important, although to a lesser extent, energy consumption in buildings and the built
5

Climate City Contract - València

environment (19% in 2019 and 22% in the BAU2030). We will have to give priority to these sectors in our decarbonization efforts to fulfill the mission.

## Lesson 3: The mission is economically, socially and environmentally profitable.

Finally, the first analysis of the economic case for València shows that the initial investment is high, but that the co-benefits to 2050 and accumulated savings over time are such, that an estimated return on investment (ROI) of more than 85% is reached, considering direct and indirect costs. It should be noted here that the ROI considered is that established by the case study provided by the model, a case study with 4 main sectors and 13 sub-sectors to act on, and which does not consider some structural and cross-cutting costs. It will be necessary to consider and include in future iterations of the Climate City Contract, the other sectors of importance in the case of València, and those transversal and structural costs necessary for its calculation. The economic model proposed by CitiES and the Climate Action Plan (CAP) of this Climate City Contract (CCC) (see Annexes I and II) offers an overall estimate of 84% reduction of CO₂ emissions for scopes 1 and 2 (and part of scope 3 with waste treatment outside the municipal limits) by 2030 for the sectors that can be leveraged with strong reductions in areas such as transport, energy consumption in buildings, electricity production or waste management. Sectors that fall outside the model (port, agriculture, etc.) will need to combine significant efforts in the decarbonization of their own activities to achieve the ultimate goal of an overall reduction of more than 80% of GHG emissions, leaving residual emissions to be addressed by the emission offsetting systems and absorption technologies to be developed.

## Lesson 4: The effort has to be shared, and the whole ecosystem will need to be activated.

One of the strengths of the modelling exercise proposed to us by CitiES and Climate-KIC is the distribution of the economic burden for the different agents that should be involved in the process. It is derived from the economic case exercise (from the model) that the City Council can only undertake, in particular in the case of València, 7% of the necessary investments. For the rest of the investment needed, 93%, it will be necessary to activate the ecosystem. For this ecosystem activation, València City Council assumes the exemplary role and has developed a shared city model oriented towards the mission and communication and awareness-raising strategies significantly oriented towards the
↑

co-benefits of the València 2030 Climate Mission, precisely to be able to bring together actors in this great effort to decarbonise. This activation of the ecosystem has been articulated through our **Mission Alliance** initiative, which we will describe throughout this Climate City Contract.

## Co-benefits of the mission

The main co-benefits for 2050 associated with the València 2030 Climate Mission and that the València Climate Climate City Contract will help to accelerate are:

Better health for people.
Healthier ecosystems for biodiversity.
More green areas close to home to enjoy, play and do sport.
Cleaner air and less pollution.
Less noise and congestion caused by car traffic.
More city spaces for people and less for traffic.
Less energy waste and lower electricity bills.
More efficient and better quality housing.
More local and better quality food.
Improved water quality.
Improved road safety.
An economy and society that produces less waste and manages to reuse more.
Sustainable economic development in the city with a strong knowledge and innovation base.
Creation of quality green jobs associated with sustainability.
Just social transition that reduces inequalities.

This makes the city's commitment to climate neutrality more meaningful than ever.

The following table provides an analysis of the people and groups benefited by the mission.

| --- | --- |

## Key priorities and strategic interventions

València's approach to the mission is differential. We propose to address the Mission through a systemic transition of the city, driving the València 2030 Urban Strategy to develop urban transformation processes inspired by the Urban Agenda and the 2030 Agenda, while experimenting through a systemic innovation oriented to the climate mission. We are convinced that the success of the SDGs and the European missions require both levers of action acting and feeding back at the same time:

+ A set of courageous public policies, with high impact on the purpose of the mission and inspired by the Urban Agenda and the 2030 Agenda.

+ Systemic innovation understood as an interconnected set of innovations, each influencing the others, with innovation both in the parts of the system and in the ways in which they are interconnected. Systemic innovation that drives creativity, experimentation and learning about new solutions to the increased complexities of the mission, so that, once their innovative value is demonstrated, they can be incorporated into public policy to multiply the impact on the mission.

# Transition and systemic innovation

The València 2030 Urban Strategy guides, through its 12 strategic lines, València's public policies that act in the multiple Emission Impact Domains defined by our Climate Mission València 2030 and, therefore, acts as the main accelerating instrument for the changes and transformations required in these Domains:

+ Mobility and Transport
+ Energy
+ Economy and Industry
+ Renaturalisation, Biodiversity and Resilience
+ Housing and Buildings
+ Urbanism and Habitat

In parallel, the image displays how smart, urban and metropolitan co-governance together with the ecosystem drives transformation in a cross-cutting way through multiple, interconnected Systemic Mission Domains:

+ Citizen and social involvement
+ Just social transition
+ Politics, funding and laws
+ Innovation and technology
+ The smart city and data
+ Social communication
+ Alliances and networks

This approach includes the necessary evaluation process that allows us to incorporate a continuous learning process and the generation of new capabilities to ensure the success of the mission.

We highlight the following systemic changes that the city of València will address to achieve climate neutrality and whose Climate Action Plan is included in Annex I, which will be incrementally expanded in terms of actors and actions throughout the different revisions and extensions of the present Climate Contract of the City of València:

+ Sustainable, inclusive and efficient urban and metropolitan mobility

Climate City Contract - València
Climate City Contract - València

A systemic change towards the decarbonisation of urban and metropolitan mobility in València through the implementation of Low Emission Zones (LEZ) of wide coverage in the city, the renovation and electrification of public and private transport, the development of sustainable mobility infrastructures of metropolitan scope, the promotion of cycling and non-motorised mobility and the development of strategic railway infrastructures, including the access channel to the city and the promotion of commuter trains, all of them key to the success of the mission in the city.

+ Just and inclusive energy transition

A systemic change towards a fair and inclusive transition of the city's energy model, combining national and regional efforts to supply 100% renewable energy to the city of València, with the development of local and neighbourhood actions aimed at developing the city's potential in energy efficiency, production and self-consumption of renewable energy and with maximum vigilance to vulnerable social situations and energy poverty. To this end, one of València's major demonstration projects in this field will be of vital importance: the creation of the Empresa Mixta de Energía Sostenible (EMES), having started the procedures for its configuration in January 2023. This initiative, 51% owned by the City Council and 49% by a private partner, will generate the same electricity consumed by 27,400 households in a year, facilitating the installation of photovoltaic solar panels on 525 municipal buildings for self-consumption, with a forecast of 72.25 megawatts of power to be installed in the city. Its mixed nature will help to reduce the energy gap, as the surpluses will be offered to citizens to reduce their electricity bills through energy communities generated under this initiative.

+ Inclusive and sustainable economic development

A systemic change towards a sustainable economic development model based on smart tourism that is a benchmark for its carbon and water footprint certification; on a sustainable and local food system; on the promotion of the circular economy and the reduction and recycling of waste; on local trade; and on an economy based on design, knowledge and innovation as a source of prosperity and development. In this inclusive and sustainable economic development, the Port of València has become a port of the future, modern, sustainable and competitive with a roadmap for decarbonisation deployed including the reduction of GHG emissions and compensation systems with local roots.

+ Sustainable and local food

0
4

A systemic change towards a fair, sustainable and proximity-based agri-food system in the city that reinforces the Huerta (vegetable and market garden) as an identifying, cultural and productive space. València seeks to re-territorialise the municipal agri-food system, providing an open-air public space that can be used as a point of reference or meeting point for local, sustainable, healthy and culturally rooted products and the city's population. At the same time, València, together with its farmers, transforms the city's agri-food culture in favour of more sustainable productive, social and environmental models, advancing in the development of fairer value chains that can improve the profitability of farms. Initiatives that we have in València such as the World Centre for Sustainable Urban Food (CEMAS), created together with the FAO or the València Food Council, together with the work of MercaValència, which is moving towards becoming a hub for sustainable food, allow us to advance in this systemic change of our agri-food model.

+ **Renaturalisation, biodiversity, resilience and climate adaptation**

A systemic change towards renaturalisation and biodiversity in the city of València and its surroundings by promoting green infrastructure, nature-based solutions and ecosystem services in the city's neighbourhoods, large urban parks and the València Sur green corridor, the Desembocadura Park and the Turia Natural Park, the renaturalisation of the northern beaches, the regeneration of La Albufera and La Devesa, the transition and interrelation between the city and the Huerta, the green corridors as emblematic projects of biodiversity, renaturalisation, resilience and climate adaptation.

+ **Sustainable buildings and housing**

A systemic shift towards the massive refurbishment of the city's buildings and housing where the city's public buildings and infrastructures belonging to any level of administration will be demonstrators of energy efficiency and renewable energy production and where a wave of renovation of València's residential buildings will be promoted. In this sense, it is necessary to point out the joint project that the Spanish "7 Mission Cities" have articulated on a national scale with the aim of developing pilot projects that will demonstrate the use of innovative local techniques and materials (bioproducts) to reduce embodied energy and improve the energy efficiency of buildings. This project has allowed us to be chosen among the 53 cities that joined the NetZeroCities Pilot Cities Programme, managed by the European Mission Platform.

+ **Urban regeneration based on social cohesion, accessibility and sustainability**

A systemic change towards a 15-minute city based on quality and urban planning with local facilities in the different neighbourhoods of the city that reduces the need for

Climate City Contract - València

2

unsustainable mobility to access services, facilities, commerce, leisure, sport, culture and employment. A city of squares where the recovery of public spaces and itineraries for people is perceived as an improvement in the quality of life. In this new urban model, we must highlight our action to bring together València city of squares, with which we have recovered more than 150,000 m² of pedestrian space between 2015 and 2021, highlighting the strategic actions for the pedestrianisation of three highly referential spaces in our city, such as the Town Hall Square, Plaza de la Reina and Plaza de Brujas.

+ Cross-cutting co-governance, learning and capacity building

A systemic change both in citizen and social involvement and in the multilevel co-governance of the transition together with the 5 helices of the ecosystem (private sector, public sector, academia, civil society and media) facilitating distributed leadership in the various actors of the city, the just social transition, the reorientation of regulatory and financial frameworks and available resources, rapid learning, alliances and networks, social communication, the generation of new innovative and technological capacities, all of this, towards the transition.

Principles and process

València approaches the process of creating and developing the Climate City Contract under the following principles of action, responsibility and accountability:

Social and political consensus

This is a Climate City Contract based on a broad political and social consensus. València offers a solid political mandate expressed in the agreements of the City Council Plenary around the València 2030 Climate Mission and the postulation of València for the European Cities Mission, which was supported by a broad spectrum of political parties from government and opposition. Additionally, the climate mission is the backbone of the València 2030 Urban Strategy in whose creation and validation more than 1,500 people from the Valencian ecosystem participated during the València Urban Forum in May 2022. The València 2030 Urban Strategy, formulated through the city's vision, is broken down into 12 strategic lines, 48 strategic objectives, 30 programmes and 198 lines of action already underway in the city, 90% of which have an impact on the València 2030 Climate Mission. Consequently, the Strategy itself is the accelerating instrument for the necessary transformations required by the city to

achieve climate neutrality, and this is displayed in our portfolio of transformative actions defined in Annex I - Climate Action Plan.

# A green and social pact for a just transition

People are the ones who live and interact in València and, therefore, the ones who create the city. Consequently, and in a context of such a terrible crisis as the one we are experiencing, it is people and their needs and expectations on which we must advance in our city model. And this is framed under the firm conviction that we cannot leave anyone behind in this green transition which, in the context of the climate, energy and social crisis we are experiencing, makes it even more essential to achieve in order to create cities that are a refuge for those who need it most.

At the end of the day, this city model in which we place people at the centre, not as passive subjects, but under the umbrella of by, for and with citizens, is a faithful representation of what the Green Deal is. A City pact that should be understood as a great green deal where the two

Climate City Contract - València
Climate City Contract - València

words: "Green" and "Deal" have the same weight and prominence. The word "Green" as an expression of the healthy, sustainable, shared and prosperous city that we dream of from our idiosyncrasy and creative and Mediterranean way of seeing and living life. The word "Deal" as the commitment to ensure that this ecological transition also serves to reduce past, present and future inequalities in our city.

In this sense, of all the Emissions Impact Domains and Systemic Action Domains defined in our València 2030 Climate Mission, we consider that the **Just Social Transition** domain of our Climate City Contract has a special consideration for Energy and the just energy transition. In a context of uncontrollable rise in energy prices and in the midst of the European debate on how to act in these circumstances, in València we aspire to do our bit in this challenge. How? By promoting the necessary change in the city's energy model, committing to the development of a sustainable and fair energy model. This transformation requires progress in self-consumption and, in general, in a decentralised model in which consumer agents produce their own energy, thus managing to optimise and reduce excess energy consumption in homes and buildings in the city, and contributing to making the energy transition a reality in València for its inhabitants.

To this end, we are committed to taking advantage of the opportunities represented by the figure of energy communities at neighbourhood level. In this line, we intend to bring energy closer to citizens and offer the information, support and tools necessary for people to take an active role in the city's energy transition, activating all the city's districts and towns through the deployment of a network of Energy Offices that will become a point of reference in each neighbourhood. In short, the goal is to transform by understanding the energy transition as a lever for tackling other social, educational and economic issues, hand in hand with the social actors involved.

Finally, it is necessary to stress that we understand this just social transition from the firm commitment, on the one hand, to encourage our productive fabric to pivot its transformation and its value proposition around sustainability and, on the other hand, to guarantee equal access to the employment opportunities that arise as a result of this transition.

## A collective journey that breaks down silos

A Climate City Contract expressed as a collective journey and not as an individual destination. The Climate City Contract breaks down silos and must provoke innovative forms of collaboration and involvement between people, between Spanish and European cities, between actors, sectors, technologies and diverse sources of knowledge, including the sector of

4

humanities, from the 5 propellers of our ecosystem: the private sector, the multilevel public sector, academia, civil society and citizens and the media. Consequently, we are talking about the need to facilitate **multi-actor collaboration** that facilitates the generation of **distributed leadership** in the face of an extremely complex challenge such as that pursued by the València 2030 Climate Mission, involving the entire innovation ecosystem of the city and even of the territory.

Climate City Contract - València
#

Figure 3: The helixes of the València innovation ecosystem

Additionally, this breaking down of silos in the city ecosystem is also transferred to València City Council, which is the political organisation that governs and manages the city, including its local agencies and foundations. València City Council, Las NAVES foundation (local innovation agency) and València Climate and Energy Foundation (local Climate and Energy agency) have created their own Mission Teams working since 2021 in the Mission Community as an interdepartmental and inter-institutional working team of the 3 organisations and open to the ecosystem to address the Climate Mission from the perspective, again, of distributed leadership.

This community has a weekly work agenda called Mission Day, where the progress of the different work packages of the Mission is shared and decisions related to the action are agreed upon. It is currently made up of 40 people from 10 different areas of municipal management, from the foundations themselves, as well as representatives from the University and from companies with demonstration projects. The community is completed with the two NetZeroCities City Advisors who have recently joined and with our involvement in the Collaboration Platform for the Climate Neutrality of Spanish Cities, citiES 2030.

The Mission Community is integrated with the Mission Transition Roundtable, which is a networked space where some of the main transition actors from different parts of the ecosystem come together.

In this logic of multi-stakeholder collaboration and distributed leadership, it is also essential to incorporate the vision of multilevel governance. In our specific case, this multilevel governance has a clear orientation towards our regional government, the Generalitat Valenciana. In this regard, and although the commitments assumed by the Generalitat in relation to our Climate City Contract are described in greater detail below, it should be noted that we already managed to include the regional government in our Climate Mission during the process of preparing our candidacy for the European Mission, when in January 2022 we signed the institutional declaration of support between the two institutional agents in the framework of the Innovation Missions: the one on the climate neutrality of cities and the one on climate adaptation.

Finally, this ecosystem for the transition is joined by the local coalition of actors committed to it and the Climate Mission, which we call the Mission Alliance.

In this collective journey, the Alliances and Networks that accompany us on the path of work and continuous learning gain special relevance: Red Innpulso, Eurocities, Energy Cities, Covenant of Mayors, GCoM, MOIN-IIPP, among many others, and in a more intense and closer way the national and European platform for the implementation of the mission: citiES 2030 and NetZeroCities, respectively.

# The Mission Alliance

Climate City Contract - Valência
#

A Climate City Contract that enacts an Mission Alliance with the aim of facilitating and promoting the emergence, as we said previously, of distributed leadership coming from the 5 helices of the ecosystem with the capacity and willingness to adhere to the València Climate City Contract to transform the city and accelerate the ecological transition from their decisions, areas of influence, sectors, activities and knowledge. Leadership in individuals, families, schools, universities, associations, businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises, large corporations, event and infrastructure managers who generate hundreds of transformative projects in their areas of decision and influence.

Figure 6: The València Mission Alliance

This Alliance for the València Mission constitutes our local multi-stakeholder platform and coalition that with its commitments and action builds the constellation of transformative projects with a common factor: the impact on the València 2030 Climate Mission. At the signing of this climate city contract there are more than 150 adhered organisations representing 20,000 companies, professionals, associations or individuals to whom we will offer their accession to the Climate City Contract of the City of València.

Around this Mission Alliance of València, we are already deploying or in the process of launching numerous actions in which the citizens themselves are playing a leading role in this transition. Among them, we could highlight:

# + València 2030 Urban Forum

A space that brings together the entire social, economic, institutional and cultural fabric of the city, to reflect in a shared way on the future sustainable development of our city and our environment. Its first edition was held throughout the month of May 2022 and our intention is to activate it every two years to give our citizens a voice in the joint construction of our Urban Strategy and our Climate Mission.

# + Ciutat-lab

Our Ciuta-Lab can be described as a citizen laboratory oriented towards the València 2030 Climate Mission. It aims to be, therefore, a space for research and innovation; a

Climate City Contract - València
1

place in which to learn to participate, to experiment and to jointly produce solutions to the climate challenge we face as a city, bringing together, for this purpose, diverse people from a logic of citizen co-design of the city under four core values: collaboration, experimentation, openness and care. Ciuta-lab aims with this space to bring together diverse actors from our five helices of innovation from a citizen logic, to collectively think about the challenges facing the city oriented to the València 2030 Climate Mission and collaboratively seek innovative solutions to address them.

+ **Climate Assembly**

Understood as a mechanism and deliberative process among the citizens of València, chosen at random while maintaining social and territorial representativeness, to debate the climate emergency situation in the city and make recommendations to improve it.

We are also in the midst of preparing the programme of events and projects to celebrate València as European Green Capital 2024, in which, as could not be otherwise, citizen participation and co-creation will be the hallmarks of our proposal. Among the different initiatives to be activated, we highlight:

+ **Mission Cities Forum**

We will organise a forum through the NZC and citiES 2030 platforms to bring together the 112 European cities of the mission in València. The forum will be horizontal and will aim to create alliances with citizens. There will be different activities, such as round tables, citizen dialogues in different neighbourhoods, neighbourhood associations, etc.

+ **European Green Capital Cycle**

In collaboration with the Mostra de València - Cinema del Mediterrani, a film festival held in València since 1980, we will propose a cycle dedicated to the European Green Capital. The short films will incorporate and address the elements of the capital, in particular the climate emergency in the context of the Mediterranean region. The festival and the screenings will take place outdoors, taking advantage of the city's green spaces.

+ **Walking València**

Walking València will be an intergenerational activity that will aim to promote a healthy lifestyle (sport, healthy eating and an active social life). It will also be an opportunity to get to know the historical and monumental trees of the city.

Climate City Contract - València
Climate City Contract - València

+ Green Gastro Talks

We will involve 8 Michelin-starred chefs in the Green Gastro Talks, 4 tandem talks and workshops throughout the year (one each season) to bring haute cuisine in relation to sustainability closer to citizens.

## A continuous learning process

Addressing the complexities of the climate mission requires learning processes that are, in themselves, a valuable outcome to be achieved. Therefore, we aspire to develop a process that builds on concrete experiences developed by the set of actors to demonstrate new approaches, build new capacities, weave new forms of collaboration and test the feasibility of new rules and principles that can then be replicated on a larger scale as part of the city strategy. Thus, a planning-action-learning process is proposed, supported by demonstration projects to develop innovative strategies that establish new concepts, new practices and new organisational and inter-institutional formulas that, when they demonstrate their value and positive impact, can later be scaled up and replicated.

For its part, the extreme speed in which changes are occurring on the climate scale, together with the methodological, procedural and even strategic novelty that the configuration of the Climate City Contracts entails, requires a process of continuous review. On the one hand, we will develop it within the framework of the Mission Teams that have been working since 2021 in the Mission Community in the form of an interdepartmental and inter-institutional work team made up of people from València City Council, Las NAVES foundation and the València Climate and Energy Foundation (all of this while continuing to work in the forums and work spaces of the Mission that are currently active or that will be activated in the future on a European, state and regional scale). On the other hand, this process of review and accountability with society and the ecosystem will be addressed on a biennial basis in the previously mentioned València 2030 Urban Forum.

## Economic development based on innovation

A Climate City Contract that collaborates in the economic and social development of its people through knowledge and innovation aimed at the sustainability of cities. The green and innovative city of València as an aspiration. To this end, and given that we cannot ignore the fact that this Climate City Contract responds to a European Innovation Mission, it is essential to make a call to science, research and innovation as necessary engines in the search for new

2
3

solutions that respond to this new paradigm of sustainable economic development for which we advocate. This has led us to reorient all the instruments of our innovation governance model Missions València 2030 to the València 2030 Climate Mission, so that this call to the entire science and innovation ecosystem is guided by the same purpose, by the same direction for the desired development.

And all of this, as an intrinsic part of the València 2030 Urban Strategy that merges the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda, the Urban Agenda and the European Innovation Missions into a single framework for action. Public policies and innovation are two sides of the same coin to achieve a healthier, sustainable, shared, prosperous and entrepreneurial, creative and Mediterranean city. A friendly city where people want to live and are proud to do so.

# Government of Spain's support for climate neutrality in Mission cities

Through the Declaration signed by the Third Vice-President of the Government and Minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, which is annexed to this document, the Government of Spain expresses its commitment with the transformation process of the city selected by the European Commission on 28 April 2022 to participate in the European Cities Mission.
#

# Commitments of the Generalitat Valenciana towards climate neutrality in the city of València

For its part, the Generalitat Valenciana, as the government of the Valencian Community and a key actor in the multilevel governance necessary for the transformation of the City of València and the achievement of the goal of a climate neutral, inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable city by 2030, has demonstrated its support to the City of València in its transition to climate neutrality by signing the Declaration of Intent "València Climate Neutral City by 2030" on 21 January 2022, which included a set of commitments now extended with the signing of the Climate City Contract of the City of València with the following:

+ To recognise the role of the cities of the Valencian Community, and in particular the city of València, as interlocutors and references for the European Mission of Cities by supporting the platforms and spaces for multi-actor collaboration that the city of València promotes to demonstrate how systemic innovation and open knowledge can lead the social, economic and environmental transformation pursued by the European Cities Mission.

+ Aligning the strategic focus of the missions, by positioning the Valencian Region as one of the first 118 regions to participate in the EU mission on climate change adaptation, in support of the European Green Deal and the EU Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. The main objective is to accelerate their transformation towards climate resilience, helping them to better prepare for and manage climate change-induced risks. This approach includes the integrated vision with municipalities, including the city of València.

+ Promoting, transferring and scaling up innovations and systemic transformations from a holistic and global perspective with a metropolitan and supra-municipal vision, thereby helping to overcome municipal boundaries that limit action against climate change.

+ Promote the implementation of comprehensive actions that address climate action transversally, such as the development of mechanisms for public procurement, regulation and financing, from the perspective of the benefits and co-benefits in the fight against climate change. The approval of Law 6/2022 of 5 December on climate change and ecological transition of the Valencian Community is a legislative instrument that implies the need to draw up Climate Action Plans for Valencian municipalities, as

Climate City Contract - València
#

well as the establishment of ambitious targets for emissions reduction, renewable energy production and energy efficiency, among others.

+ To develop the instruments of the European Green Deal and RePowerEU for the decarbonisation of the economy, through the matters within its competence.

+ Support the implementation of measures that contribute to the mitigation and adaptation of Valencian municipalities, including the city of València. The regional administration has been recognised as Coordinator of the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, with the vision of decarbonising its territory, strengthening its capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change and ensuring that its citizens have access to safe, sustainable and affordable energy. Funding lines have also been established, as well as instruments to help decision-making, examples of good practices, training sessions and technical assistance.

+ Strengthen research-innovation-city collaboration towards the transformation of cities by working together with city councils and universities in their role as facilitators of urban transformation.

+ Develop a framework to facilitate the sharing and transparency of data and indicators that are relevant to the achievement of the objectives of the European Cities Mission and the European Adaptation Mission.

+ Promote the creation of a green tax system as an incentive for a new cycle of investment and innovation in line with climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, and as an accelerator towards a green transition that adequately reflects the value of ecosystems, including the creation of a green transition fund to accelerate this transition.

+ Promote actions that simplify bureaucracy and improve capacities and processes by increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of investments derived from European funds in cities.

+ Define the instruments to promote the supply of 100% renewable energies to Valencian municipalities by 2030, encouraging self-consumption and photovoltaic energy production on roofs and parking areas, transferring the RePowerEU measures to regional regulations, and supporting new production and distribution models, such as

Climate City Contract - València
#

local energy communities, including the participation of public building roofs, such as educational centres, in renewable energy generation projects.

+ Establish mechanisms to facilitate urban systemic innovation in the form of living labs and sand boxes, also promoted through the RIS3 of the Operational Programme of the Valencian Community.

+ To promote and support the Declaration of an event of exceptional public interest for the European Cities Mission in the chosen cities of the Valencian Community.

+ Promote metropolitan mobility policies through the Metropolitan Transport Authority, FGV and the Regional Ministry of Territorial Policy, Public Works and Mobility that encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport with actions such as: park-and-ride car parks, public transport for companies and industrial estates, improvement of rail transport, the infrastructure network of cycle-pedestrian lanes and VAO lanes, among other measures to promote sustainable mobility.

+ Deepen the renovation and rehabilitation of the Generalitat Valenciana's building stock in order to achieve, together with the City Council, that the city's public buildings are Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB) by 2030.

+ Promote housing policies that make it possible to take advantage of and multiply the effects of the wave of energy renovation promoted by Europe.

+ Promote the resilience of the coastline, the improvement of the health of coastal and continental water and the renaturalisation of the territory with special protection and improvement of the green and blue infrastructures of the city of València, which will act as carbon sinks.

+ Promote the circular economy, waste reduction and sustainable collection and treatment at the regional level, promoting a regional circular economy law and environmental education at the municipal level to bring about a change of behaviour in society, ensuring the involvement and critical and conscious vision of citizens.

+ Promote sustainable agriculture and local urban food that will have an impact on the decarbonisation of the territory.

Climate City Contract - València
↑

+ Study the feasibility of transferring the approval of an innovation mission associated with the decarbonisation of our territory to the entire territory of the Valencian Community, creating research, innovation and financing instruments aimed at achieving the climate mission that can accelerate the transformation of cities.

Likewise, the Government of the Generalitat Valenciana is committed to continue working in partnership with the Government of the city of València to expand, specify and follow up and update these commitments in successive reviews of the València Climate City Contract.

# Supporting statement of National Government for the climate neutrality of Spanish Mission Cities

I hereby place on record the Spanish Government's commitment to support the climate city contracts presented by the cities, which were selected by the European Commission on 28 April 2022 to participate in the European Cities Mission: Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza, Valladolid and Vitoria-Gasteiz.

This support contributes to the ecological and energy transformation of cities and to a greater climate and social resilience, which is materialised in the Spanish State's framework of competences, among others, in the following aspects:

The impulse of a regulatory framework aligned with the systemic innovation and public-private collaboration required by the European Mission of Cities. In this context, it highlights:

+ The Spanish Urban Agenda, approved in February 2019, which highlights the need to achieve sustainability in urban development policies. It is constituted as a working method and a process for all the actors involved in cities that aspire to an equitable, fair and sustainable development from the different fields of action. This strategy is developed around 30 specific objectives and 291 action lines, which includes all villages and cities regardless of size and population, and it addresses economic, social and environmental sustainability.

+ Law 7/2021, of 20 May, on climate change and energy transition. This institutional framework guarantees, through its various measures, the coordination of sectoral policies, ensures coherence between them and synergies to achieve the objective of climate neutrality, and increases our capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
↑

The work commitment on the regulatory developments of the Law is clear. Due to the implications for the European Mission Cities, the following stand out: (i) in the energy field, work is being done to establish a framework to deploy energy efficiency in industries and buildings, and renewable energies as vectors towards decarbonisation, (ii) in terms of emission-free mobility, the mandate for cities to adopt sustainable urban mobility plans with mitigation measures, such as low-emission zones, is included, iii) in the area of green procurement, we are working to establish measures to integrate the fight against climate change in public procurement procedures, such as the inclusion of emission reduction and carbon footprint criteria specifically aimed at the fight against climate change as specific technical requirements in procurement specifications.

The launch of the Multi-stakeholder Collaboration Platform for the Climate Neutrality of Spanish Cities (citiES 2030), a tool created ad hoc and already in operation to facilitate the implementation of the Cities Mission.

With the implementation of this platform, the Government of Spain not only fulfils one of the initial activities of the Mission, but also becomes a reference for the other countries and cities in the programme.

This platform is a multi-stakeholder innovation and collaboration infrastructure to support and accelerate the transformation of Spanish cities towards climate neutrality.

The platform's main beneficiaries are city councils of Spanish cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants or provincial capitals that want to achieve full or partial climate neutrality by 2030, as well as cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants that want to initiate this process.

The platform offers cities a range of services, including:

+ Training, learning and skills enhancement
↑

+ The support for the development of local systemic innovation platforms for the design of transformative project portfolios;
+ The assistance in drafting and monitoring climate city contracts and the design of roadmaps in a multi-stakeholder environment;
+ The connection with related processes in other European cities; the incubation of multi-city projects; the citizen participation and activation;
+ The assistance to cities to structure transformation financing schemes, involving financial actors;
+ The strategic communication.

The Platform's governance is multi-stakeholder and multi-level, with the aim of facilitating, ordering and guaranteeing directionality and stability in these collaborations. In this way, it relies on the participation of the actors of the quintuple helix:

+ The public sector (administrations and public agencies).
+ The private sector (companies, financial sector, urban infrastructure sector and professional associations).
+ The academia (universities and research centres).
+ The civil society (NGOs and neighbourhood associations).
+ The media.
4

The support to mobilisation of green investments. A good example is the deployment of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan through the mobilisation of an unprecedented volume of investment that prioritises not only mitigating the effects of the crisis, but also the transformation of our country towards a sustainable and inclusive economy.

The Recovery Plan recognises the fundamental role of cities in economic and social transformation, due to their capacity to generate short-term activity with a pull effect on industry and key sectors, and their importance in terms of the climate emergency. Thus, it includes initiatives aimed at essential aspects for the climate neutrality of cities, such as:

+ The improvement of sustainable mobility, with the promotion of electric and fuel cell vehicles and the extension of recharging infrastructures, through the different MOVES programmes.
+ The promotion of the renovation of urban residential environments, housing, buildings and neighbourhoods, with the priority objective of decreasing energy consumption and promoting decarbonisation in the household stock.
+ The development of energy communities that promote social innovation and citizen participation in renewables, energy efficiency and electric mobility, thereby contributing to fair and inclusive decarbonisation in urban areas.
+ The promotion of self-consumption for the energy use of urban roofs and decks, storage behind the meter and renewable HVAC in homes.
+ The development of transformative strategies and initiatives for urban renaturalisation, helping to increase green infrastructure and biodiversity in Spanish cities and favouring Nature-Based Solutions to respond to their socio-environmental challenges.
+ The support for the implementation of waste regulation, in collaboration with the autonomous communities and cities, with investments in
5

digitalisation for environmental management, through the Recovery Plan.

+ The deployment of calls for grants to municipalities and local entities for the implementation of low-emission zones in cities and the sustainable and digital transformation of urban transport.

The monitoring of the progress of the seven cities through the information processed in the citiES 2030 Platform, with the aim of integrating the urban transformation roadmap into the country's decarbonisation process.

As part of the iterative process of the European Cities Mission, the Spanish Government will participate in the monitoring and updating of the commitments made in the climate neutrality agreements of the cities of Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Valladolid, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Zaragoza, supporting the recognition and dissemination of the progress achieved.

# 2030 CLIMATE NEUTRALITY ACTION PLAN (CAP)

## ANNEX I. 2030 CLIMATE NEUTRALITY ACTION PLAN OF THE CITY OF VALENCIA

## INTRODUCTION

To make València a climate neutral city by 2030, and to do so by (and for) the citizens, within the context of the European Mission for 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030. The València 2030 Climate Mission is our contribution from València to the EU reducing climate emissions by 55% by 2030 and becoming climate neutral by 2050.

## How will we do it? València's perspective

València's approach to the mission is distinctive. We propose to tackle the mission by merging the 2030 Agenda with systemic innovation oriented to the purpose of the mission. We strongly believe that the success of the SDGs and the European missions require both levers of action acting and feeding back at the same time:

A set of bold public policies, with high impact on the purpose of the mission and inspired by the 2030 Agenda.
Systemic innovation understood as a network of interconnected innovations, each building upon the others, with innovation occurring in both the individual parts of the system and the ways in which they are linked together. Systemic innovation encouraging creativity, experimentation, and learning in order to find new solutions for the complex challenges of the mission. Once the innovative value of these solutions is demonstrated, they can be incorporated into public policy to maximize impact on the mission.

In València, public policies and systemic innovation are two sides of the same coin. For this reason, the València 2030 Climate Mission incorporates two instrumental objectives for the success of the mission:

Collaborate in the development of the València 2030 Urban Strategy that ensures compliance with the objectives and targets set by international policy frameworks, such as the COP21 Paris Agreement, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (especially SDGs 11 and 13), the Spanish and European Urban Agenda and the New Urban Agenda - Habitat III.
Promote the necessary systemic transformations and innovations that position València at the forefront of European innovation and efforts to comply with the European Green Deal.

The València 2030 Urban Strategy guides, through its 12 strategic lines, València's public policies that act in the multiple Emission Impact Domains:

Mobility and Transport
Energy

Smart, urban and metropolitan governance drives transformation in a cross-cutting way through multiple Systemic Mission Domains acting in an interconnected way:

Civic Engagement
Policy&amp;Finance&amp;Law
Fair Social Transition
Systemic innovation &amp; technology
Smart City&amp; Data
Social communication
Alliances and networks

## WORK PROCESS

València’s main commitments to climate neutrality are as follows:

In 2009, Valencia signed the Covenant of Mayors, committing to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions by $20\%$ by 2020
In June 2010 the Sustainable Energy Action Plan for the city of València (PAES) was published.
In 2011 the València 2020 Climate Change Strategy was published, which is the result of integrating two previous plans, the Environmental Action Plan and the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP- 2010).
On 16 October 2014, the Local Government Board approved the accession to the Covenant of Mayors for Climate Change Adaptation.
On 20 February 2015 Climate projections for the municipality of València were published as well as the Analysis of vulnerability to climate change in the municipality of València.
In September 2015, the plenary approved the accession to the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy.
In 2018 València joins the Energy Cities network and from 2020 is part of its Board of Directors.
By agreement of the plenary session of April 2019, the municipal strategy of the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) of the City of València was
AJUNTAMENT DE VALENCIA
Missiones
València 2030
Climate Action Plan (CAP)

approved (Plenary Session April 2019), by which a commitment was made to reduce GHG emissions by 40% by 2030, increase energy efficiency by 27%, use energy from renewable sources by 27% and increase resilience to climate change.

In the September 2019 plenary session, the Declaration of Climate Emergency is approved, which includes:
Reduce GHGs to reach zero clean balance no later than 2040 and if possible before 2035.
Halt biodiversity loss and restore ecosystems.
Promote energy saving, energy efficiency and the use of 100% renewable energy.
Reduce water consumption.
Promote adaptation to climate change.
Working towards sustainable and low-carbon mobility.

The Local Government Board of 21 January 2021 agrees to endorse the Paris Declaration to keep global average temperature increase to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, to continue efforts to limit global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, decarbonisation by 2040s or earlier or by 2050 at the latest to limit global warming to 1.5°C and decarbonisation to 50% by 2030.
In April 2021, the first monitoring report of the SECAP is published.
The October 2021 plenary agreement formalises the new commitments of the Covenant of Mayors with the objective of decarbonisation by 2050 and keeping the global temperature increase below 1.5°C.
The plenary session of February 2021 approved the València Neutral City mission with the aim of achieving at least 3 climate-neutral neighbourhoods or towns in the city before 2030 by and for the citizens.
The Local Government Board of 27 January 2022 approved València's candidacy for the European call for the Mission 100 Climate Neutral Cities in 2030, by and for the citizens.
The plenary session of 27 January 2021 approved the commitment of the city of València to join the Mission 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030, assuming the ambition of climate neutrality required by the European mission of cities.
In April 2022 the European Commission announced that the city of València has been chosen as one of the 112 cities that will participate in the EU's mission to become smart and climate neutral cities by 2030.

In August 2022, the city of València starts the studies and preparatory work together with its CitiES2030 and NetZeroCities alliances for the design and co-creation of the Climate City Contract (CCC) contained in this document and composed of 4 parts (Mandate&amp;Commitments, Climate Action Plan (CAP), Climate Investment Plan (CIP) and

Missions València 2030
Climate Action Plan (CAP)
citiES 2030

the Mission Alliance (València Muti-actor local platform) +Individual signatory commitments) that will be subject to periodic iterations in the systemic transition process that it entails.

## How is this ambition addressed in the following Action Plan?

As we have advanced previously, in the context of the European call of the year 2022 to its Cities Mission, València updates in the City Council Plenary of 27 January 2022 its ambition and its climate commitments following the European guidelines and recommendations. Once again, with a broad consensus between government and opposition parties, the València 2030 Climate Mission was approved, thus reflecting the city's great ambition to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and to adapt to climate change, including the necessary social transition, in a context of unprecedented climate crisis in which, moreover, the Mediterranean arc is suffering its impacts with even greater intensity if possible.

It should be noted that, in the framework of the European Mission for Climate Neutral Cities to 2030, only Scope 3 emissions associated with waste disposal/management are included in the definition of climate neutrality. However, there is a risk that the measures adopted in the following Action Plan could negatively affect Scope 3. Therefore, in addition to the emphasis on circularity and sustainable food as ways to address these emissions included in this Climate Action Plan (CAP) derived from the València 2030 Urban Strategy and, in the interest of its commitment to sustainability, València proposes:

Preparation of a checklist of influence where the impacts on Scope 3 emissions of the measures that are intended to be implemented with this Action Plan for the city's climate neutrality by 2030 will be assessed.
Design of an instrument for the evaluation and monitoring of the actions of this Action Plan, with special emphasis on controlling and limiting these Scope 3 emissions.
Ambition to also achieve neutrality in Scope 3 for the whole city of València in 2040, for which it will be essential to act with a special focus on the transition towards circularity of our economic and production model at all levels. It is also important to stress that the city of València has a firm commitment to sustainable and local food, one of its priorities, and that it has a significant impact on these Scope 3 emissions. All this will be addressed from the Emissions Impact Domain "Economy &amp; Industry" in order to achieve a circular and sustainable economic model in the city of València.

It should be noted that València has been selected together with the regional government, the Generalitat Valènciana, by the European Environment Agency (EEA) as a case study of synergies between missions: mitigation and adaptation. In this project, in addition to activating the space for inter-administrative collaboration, the links between mitigation and adaptation measures are analysed, seeking to maximise their transformative capacity. Special emphasis is placed on avoiding maladaptation practices

Missions València 2030
Climate Action Plan (CAP)
citiES 2030

and on the study of climate and emission proofing of such actions. This is a methodological process established by the European Union, particularly for infrastructure projects. The aim is to avoid that proposed projects/actions lead to unintended emissions (e.g. Scope 3) or increased vulnerability to climate risks. In València, we have proposed to take inspiration from this methodology to propose instruments to avoid unforeseen and undesired consequences and as a basis for the justification of investment decisions.

# PART A - CURRENT STATE OF CLIMATE ACTION

The Climate Action Plan (CAP) is structured in three distinct parts. The first part A sets out the current state of climate action, which is the focus of the following modules. Part B develops the pathways to climate neutrality and finally Part C describes the cross-cutting innovation and financing actions needed to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

Part A therefore serves to explain the baseline situation on which our climate action is built.

It consists of three modules, module A-1 describes the baseline against which emission reductions are undertaken. Module A-2 describes current policies and strategies and finally module A-3 identifies systemic barriers.

# MODULE A-1 : Greenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline inventory

As a preliminary consideration, this Climate City Contract (CCC) sets its time horizon for actions and investment in the decade 2020-2030. Therefore, the first year of study should be 2020. However, we have selected 2019 as the base year for the study, to avoid distortions in COVID emissions in 2020. 2019 will therefore be our fictitious year 2020.

Moreover, València has been a signatory of the Covenant of Mayors since 2009. The Covenant of Mayors is an initiative, initially European (2008) and later global, which promotes the commitment of cities to reduce their carbon emissions and improve their resilience to the effects of climate change. Covenant of Mayors signatories are required to develop and submit a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) and to report their emissions levels through GHG inventories.

As a first step in developing this SECAP, València developed an emissions inventory that provided a baseline for understanding the sources and magnitude of the city's GHG emissions. Since then, València conducts an emissions inventory at least every two years, and this city inventory includes emissions data from key sectors (Buildings, Transport, Waste, Industrial processes and use of waste products).

To understand the necessary emission reductions that need to be undertaken to achieve climate neutrality, it is first necessary to carry out an analysis of the baseline situation, and for this we make use of the emission inventories derived from the SECAP, which are carried out for the city and are a reference point.

However, it should be noted that as part of the EIT Climate-KIC Deep Demonstration programme carried out in Madrid in 2020, an economic model was developed to identify the most cost-effective decarbonisation strategies for the city. This model, developed by Material Economics, has served as the basis for the development of a common tool for the 7 cities of the Spanish Platform for Climate Neutrality, citiES2030. Adapted in order to be used to complete different tables of the Climate City Contract (CCC), this model uses a lifecycle approach to assess the economic viability of different decarbonisation strategies.
AJUNTAMENT DE VALENCIA
Missions València 2030
Climate Action Plan (CAP)
citiES 2030

To feed this model, we use bottom-up activity data that we have collected from the different areas of the city council, also using the year 2019 (fictitious 2020). This data is used to construct a Business as Usual 2030 state.

As proposed in the Mission's Info-kit, thanks to the economic model provided by citiES, we have been able to evaluate Business as Usual 2030. This process establishes as a baseline on which to build the Climate City Contract (CCC) a projection of the current situation (in this case, 2019) without carrying out the Climate Action Plan (CAP) and considering population growth, possible increase in GDP, etc.: this is the so-called Business As Usual 2030 (hereinafter BAU2030).

In this section we will present the process to reach BAU2030, through the bottom-up calculation of emissions thanks to the activity data and emission factors collected. On the other hand, to serve as a reference and point of comparison, the 2019 emissions inventory is presented.

Thus, the tables in this module allow us to understand this BAU2030 and its relationship and differences with our 2019 emissions inventory derived from the SECAP. In fact, table A-1.1-a originates from that 2019 inventory, considering the final energy by sectors and scopes derived from the inventory. On the other hand, table A-1.2-a presents the emission factors also derived from the 2019 inventory of the SECAP. With these two tables, table A-1.4-a is BUILT, which is related to CO2eq emissions, which is identified with the results of the 2019 SECAP emissions inventory.

On the other hand, the model requires as input data the activity data in table A-1.3-b and the emission factors related to these activity data, which are collected in table A-1.2-b. With these two tables, table A-1.4-b is built, which shows us a starting situation, which has been introduced into the model, somewhat different from that expected with the SECAP inventory, the discrepancies of which are explained below.

Finally, table A-1.4-c is a result of the proposed economic model on the basis of the bottom-up situation in 2019, i.e. through table A-1.4-b. This BAU2030 projection made by the model assumes that during the decade under study there will be, on the one hand, certain efficiencies due to planned renewals and obsolescence that will reduce emissions, although population variation and possible economic growth will produce an increase in emissions. In other words, the situation that we would have if the following Climate Action Plan (CAP) is not implemented. It therefore serves as a baseline against which to determine our emission reduction targets for the Climate Action Plan (CAP).

It should be noted that this proposed modelling exercise with bottom-up activity data described in table A-1.3-b allows us to get closer to the reality of what is happening in València. Thanks to this process, we have made a critical review of our emissions inventory from SECAP.

Another aspect that should be reinforced is that the study is carried out with the geographical limits of the municipality of València, and that the model considers scopes 1 and 2 fundamentally, with scope 3 data relating to waste treated outside the city.

All this analysis allows us to identify the sectors to act on and the actions to be carried out, which will be associated with a reduction in emissions and which are developed in Part B of the Climate Action Plan (CAP).

A-1.6: Description and assessment of the Baseline GHG Inventory

It has been decided to take 2019 as the reference year, in order to have a baseline that is not distorted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This will be our fictitious year 2020 as the model considers the decade 2020-2030.

It has also been decided to show the 2019 inventory from the SECAP, as opposed to the bottom-up calculation result of the economic model for 2019 (figure B). This calculation is performed with the activity data from table A-1.3_b: Activities by source sector (source: input data from the economic model) and the emission factors from table A-1.2_b: Emission factors applied. We discovered in the process that the emission results show discrepancies between the 2019 inventory derived from the SECAP and the bottom-up calculation of the model in the different sectors:

Transport sector: the methodology used by our emissions inventory in the transport sector greatly overstates the results. The methodology used by the SECAP inventory (graph A), follows the fuel consumption in the province and prorates it by the number of vehicles registered in the city of Valência. This is a very imprecise approximation because the vehicles registered do not necessarily have to be in circulation in the city. However, the methodology we have followed in our bottom-up study to provide data for the economic model is based on the mobility surveys of the SUMP (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan) and the PMoME (Sustainable Metropolitan Mobility Plan for the Valência area) as well as data from the IMD (Average Daily Intensity) measured on the different access roads to the city. The differences are considerable, from 1,176 ktonnes of CO2 eq in the inventory to a calculation of 513.5 ktonnes.Electricity sector: if we add scope 2 in our SECAP, electricity production totals 409 ktonnes. The bottom-up calculation of the model gives us 461.7 ktonnes. This difference is due to two factors. On the one hand, for the bottom-up calculation of the Economic Model, an emission factor of 222gCO2/kWh has been taken from the national electricity mix for 2019. This is justified by the homogenisation of the Spanish cities in the mission, as opposed to the 164gCO2/kWh that was reflected in our SECAP due to the regional mix. Regional. On the other hand, due to modelling needs, the consumption of electricity for heating produced by radiators/splits, within the buildings and heating sector, has been represented.Buildings and Heating Sector: no direct equivalent in SECAP.Waste Sector: Wastewater treatment is not included in the economic model.

Finally, we include the Business as Usual representation to 2030 (figure C), which is what we take as the baseline for emissions reductions. In effect, the economic case model makes a projection, a BAU (Business as Usual) to 2030. This takes into account, on the one hand, population growth which encourages economic development and therefore some increase in emissions in the Buildings and Heating sector. On the other hand, the efficiencies that come with the replacement of cars, buses, etc. with more efficient technologies reduce the emissions of the transport sector fundamentally. These emissions are globally compensated by a slight reduction in the carbon footprint of approximately 6%. Furthermore, as we have seen in the bottom-up calculations, it distributes the sectors differently, grouping together electricity from all sectors, as the latter becomes a sector of action.

The BAU 2030 outlines the baseline scenario for emission reductions, in our case: electricity accounts for 31%, transport 26% and buildings and heating 22%. These three sectors therefore account for almost 80% of emissions in the BAU 2030 and should be targeted as a priority.

Finally, the model of the economic case does not consider IPPU and AFOLU, which are included in others and represent here 16%, which is not negligible by any means.

Although emissions reductions in the Other sector are not assessed through the levers offered by the model, transformative actions to address these sectors are included. A next iteration of the document will also include a quantitative assessment of emission reductions by these sectors, which are not currently included in the model. In fact, the improvement of the model for the inclusion of these sectors is also being considered. In any case, Valência is working to include these sectors, which it also considers essential for the transformation and transition towards neutrality.

# MODULE A-2 : Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

In line with the European approach, we are championing the broadest possible understanding of the Green Deal, so that our city is Green, but also governed by the principles of a Social Deal that translates into leaving no one behind in this green transition, which is non-negotiable.

It is time to be more social and supportive than ever and to put València and any other city that wants to join in this challenge under the protection of the most fragile part of our societies.

Based on the 6 València City Views, and supported by our València 2030 Strategy, we are providing the local and urban vision of how to advance in each of the axes of the Green Deal, giving shape to different policies, strategies and regulations, which are also aligned with those at regional and state level.

In the same way, the regulatory, strategic and operational development that we have been carrying out in recent years in València is directly linked to two other European-level elements of great relevance for our Climate City Contract (CCC), namely:

On the one hand, the RePoweEU plan, as a European Commission plan to save energy, produce clean energy and diversify energy supplies on a European scale, with a special focus on reducing energy poverty.
And on the other hand, the New European Bauhaus, whose values associated with the inclusiveness of the green transition are of particular inspiration for us, World Design Capital 2022.

## A-2.2: Description and assessment of policies

The Spanish Government's policy to combat climate change and energy transition responds to the commitment made at international and European level and presents an opportunity from an economic and modernisation point of view for our country, as well as from a social point of view, facilitating the equitable distribution of wealth in the decarbonisation process, and places the fight against climate change and energy transition at the centre of political action, as a key vector for the economy and society to build the future and generate new socio-economic opportunities.

The mainstreaming and coordination of climate change and energy transition policies is essential to enhance synergies for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

The policy incorporates the variable that the transition to a decarbonised economy also requires measures to facilitate a just transition for the most vulnerable groups and geographical areas.

With regard to the Generalitat Valenciana's policy to combat climate change, it responds to the need to define a medium and long-term framework to guarantee an orderly transition of our economy towards a low-carbon, competitive, innovative, resource-efficient and climate-resilient economy, which is what the Paris Agreement requires of us and to which it is committed. At the same time, it is necessary to push forward the measures stemming from European and national energy and climate obligations already undertaken.

Climate change is a cross-cutting issue that requires the concerted action of all administrations, social and economic agents and the citizens themselves, and from all spheres: local, regional and global. For this reason, the aim of this policy is to establish the regulatory framework to coordinate, structure and organise the fight against climate change in the Valencian Community.

The city of Valencia has become a European benchmark in the fight against climate change, a project that involves all the city's agents (the five helixes: administration, private sector, academia, organised civil society and the media) and affects all areas of political management, with an Urban Strategy that is the roadmap for the city's comprehensive, innovative, shared and transformative development over the next decade.

The Urban Strategy proposes six visions: healthy city, sustainable city, prosperous and entrepreneurial city, shared city, creative city and Mediterranean city; and twelve strategic lines to transform the city:

Climate resilience, territory and renaturalisation of the city
Just and inclusive energy transition
Sustainable, inclusive and efficient urban and metropolitan mobility
AJUNTAMENT DE VALENCIA
Missions València 2030

Accessible and sustainable housing
Associative fabric and intergenerational and intercultural citizen networks
Well-being, education and health and at all stages of life
Inclusive and sustainable economic development
Innovation, culture and sustainable tourism
Urban and metropolitan governance

The climate mission is included at the heart of the València 2030 Urban Strategy and guides all the urban strategies, lines of action, programmes and demonstration projects of the Strategy.

Taking all this into account, it can be concluded that the main gap we find in València is linked to the need to deploy all the projects linked to many of the plans previously defined under the umbrella of a recently approved global strategy such as the València 2030 Urban Strategy. The advantage? The fact that this strategy has been designed incorporating the València 2030 Climate Mission at its very core, which has meant that 90% of its actions have a positive impact on it and, therefore, on this Climate City Contract (CCC). However, time is required to align all the policies of a municipality of such a significant size as València (and even more complex when we consider its entire metropolitan area), in addition to the progressive evolution or creation of new regulations to support this transformation of public policies.

And, specifically, we can conclude that in the municipality we have a specific gap with regard to circular economy policies which, to a certain extent, is due to the fragmentation of competences that exists in the municipality. At present, there is still no global circular economy strategy in València, although it has been included as a specific action programme in the València 2030 Urban Strategy: Programme 17 - Water, sanitation and waste; line of action 17.4 - Circular Economy.

The following table, table A-2.3, summarises the emission reduction targets that are proposed with the Action Plan that follows in the coming modules, and the gap that would remain to achieve neutrality. As expected, and from the commitment to the Mission, the study carried out in the case of València using the economic model indicates that, with the measures and ambitious targets proposed and visualised thanks to the study, this gap would be zero.

As previously mentioned, the economic model provided by citiES uses a BAU 2030 Business as Usual 2030 scenario as a reference to estimate the potential emission reductions that can be achieved through different decarbonisation strategies and actions. This scenario represents a projection of what the city's emissions trajectory would look like if the Climate Neutral Action Plan were not implemented.

As indicated in Module A-1, BAU2030 is constructed with bottom-up activity data from 2019 (fictitious year 2020), and the result is a projection to 2030 with two fundamental hypotheses: that there is economic and population growth in that decade (in the case of València, 0.02% per year), which increases emissions in buildings and heating, but it also considers efficiencies in the replacement of car technology, boilers, etc. and, therefore, a small reduction in these sectors.

This BAU 2030 is described in Module A-1, Table A-1-4_c and Figure A-1-5_c.
AJUNTAMENT DE VALENCIA
Missions València 2030
Climate Action Plan (CAP)
citiES 2030

Thus, BAU2030 describes realistically what would happen if the Climate Action Plan (CAP) were not implemented, and is therefore a good benchmark against which to implement emission reductions.

In addition, as we will see later, the BAU 2030 scenario provides a baseline against which to compare the cost-effectiveness of different decarbonisation strategies and actions. By comparing the costs and benefits of different decarbonisation pathways with the BAU 2030 scenario, the model can estimate the potential ROI (Return on Investment) of each strategy and action.

The following table shows the emission reduction results provided by the model, by sector. It can be seen that the greatest proportional reduction is achieved in the Buildings and Heating sector, with 95% compared to the BAU in the same sector, while with the ambition adopted, transport would reduce its emissions by 74% compared to BAU2030. Overall, an 84% reduction in emissions compared to BAU2030 would be achieved. Therefore, this 84% has been taken as a reference to assume that the ambition adopted by the emitting sectors that have been left out of the model, such as industry (in the case of València, especially the port) and agriculture, will also reduce their emissions by 84% with respect to BAU2030. The next steps are to introduce these sectors into the model, first to accurately quantify their emissions, and then to assess whether the proposed actions are sufficient to achieve, if not that 84% overall, at least 80%, in order to distribute the efforts in this decarbonisation effort. It should be pointed out that, although not quantified, the Action Plan presented includes actions involving sectors that are not currently represented in the model, with their activity data and action paths towards neutrality. Finally, it should be noted that residual emissions in this case are 16% of BAU2030, and these will be covered by the emission compensation systems and absorption technologies that are developed.

Residual emissions are emissions that cannot be reduced through climate action and are offset. Residual emissions can amount to a maximum of 20%, as indicated in the Mission Info Kit.
In the case of this analysis for València, this results in a total of 16%.
we consider the emission reductions in the "Others" sector to be the same as in the other 4 sectors.
emission reductions foreseen in existing strategies and action planning should be quantified by sector.
Emissions gap = This is the gap that would be missing to achieve climate neutrality; in case it is 0, it is considered that neutrality is expected to be achieved with this action plan.

# MODULE A- 3: Systemic barriers and opportunities to 2030 climate neutrality

Here we develop the outcome of the mapping of the ecosystem of actors involved in climate action and the identification of systemic barriers and opportunities.

The definitions of the concepts are set out below:

Barriers: main elements (infrastructure, capacities, processes, partnerships, funds) that could hinder the transition to climate neutrality.
Opportunities: key elements (infrastructure, capacities, processes, partnerships, funds) that could contribute to the transition to climate neutrality.
Participatory model for Climate neutrality (local platforms): stakeholder ecosystem, partnerships with stakeholders, with other areas of government, with the private sector, with citizens, with other cities, with academic or research and innovation institutions; stakeholder involvement and contribution to the development and implementation of the city's climate policy, etc.

To this end,

The existing connections and links with the actors that make up the system (all urban actors) and the main interests around which they collaborate are detected.
Opportunities and barriers are compared with their strategic objectives to understand how to establish the most favourable conditions (i.e. prepare the local system) for the implementation of the transition to climate neutrality.

The complexity of the challenge of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 is pushing us to bring together the maximum number of agents in a collective intelligence exercise aimed almost entirely at developing innovative solutions that have a positive impact on the multiple Emission Impact Domains defined by the València 2030 Climate Mission.

To achieve this major goal, as explained above, we have made a call for collective action by our entire ecosystem under the umbrella of what we have called the Mission Alliance, activating through it many of the agents that we will describe below. It is worth noting that, among all these Domains, we have placed special focus on trying to engage and respond to the needs of vulnerable groups in the energy field, with the fight against energy

## A-3.2: Description of systemic barriers

### General barriers:
Insufficient administrative and/or operational capacity.
Lack of internal human resources (too difficult to recruit a public authority (even temporary staff).
New roles and profiles with a broader cross-cutting vision.
Need for a "rethink": "Think climate neutrality": how many CO2 emissions are avoided with this project, this tender, this procedure, this regulation, etc.?
Regulatory red tape: overly complicated procedures with bureaucracy. Balance between security/transparency and efficiency.
Fragmentation of responsibilities: complex solutions require innovative schemes, not fragmented policies, levels of government, siloed departments...
Difficulties in establishing public-private partnerships: a well-established legal framework is needed. Different perspective on expectations.
Prohibitive investment costs: New technologies, new solutions for climate action require prohibitive costs.
Lack of funding schemes: new ideas beyond grants.

### Sector-specific barriers:

#### Energy:
High initial capital costs.
Unfavourable electricity pricing rules.
Lack of legal framework for independent power.
Producers.
Lack of access to credit.

How do they affect our Climate Action Plan (CAP)?

0
AJUNTAMENT DE VALENCIA
Missions València 2030
Climate Action Plan (CAP)
citiES 2030

Difficulties for the deployment of Neighbourhood Energy Communities due to insufficient regulatory framework.
Difficulties in locating Neighbourhood Energy Communities in certain areas/neighbourhoods.
Difficulties in the absence of citizen energy empowerment
Difficulties for the deployment of electric mobility due to the existence of subsidies for certain fuels.

Transport:
High initial capital costs.
Economic and time constraints in the use of public transport.
Infrastructural and urban barriers to active travel (lack of pavements, cycle paths, etc.).
Psychosocial barriers to active travel (risk of collision and injury and/or exposure to crime and verbal abuse).

How do they affect our Climate Action Plan (CAP)?
Slowness in the renewal of the municipal and bus fleet towards electric mobility.
Difficulties in the deployment of Low Emission Zones in València due to latent legal uncertainty at state level.

Waste management:
Inefficient recycling processes.
Insufficient data collection.
Slow transformation of behaviour, including cultural barriers.
Ineffective waste prevention.

How do they affect our Climate Action Plan (CAP)?
Lack of a comprehensive Circular Economy Plan in the city.
Fragmentation of competences that prevents the development of some of the projects envisaged.
Insufficient citizen empowerment in this area.

All these barriers, however, are expected to be addressed in the different programmes of the Action Plan of the València 2030 Urban Strategy that have an impact on these specific areas of these sectors, as well as in the necessary legislative developments at different scales (state, regional and local).

AA-3.3: Description or visualisation of the city's participatory model for climate neutrality

Given the importance of the Participatory Model for the success of the València 2030 Climate Mission, we explain in detail how it works in the additional documentation to the València Climate City Contract (CCC) presented under the name "Doc 01_Alliance for the València Mission_Local Multi-Stakeholder Platform".

Below, we highlight some of the most important aspects of the participatory model for climate neutrality designed in the city of València.

A collective journey that breaks down silos

A Climate Deal expressed as a collective journey and not as an individual destination. The Climate Deal breaks down silos and should trigger innovative forms of collaboration and involvement between people, between Spanish and European cities, between actors, sectors, technologies and diverse sources of knowledge, including the humanities, from the 5 helices of our ecosystem: the private sector, the multilevel public sector, academia, civil society and citizens and the media.

We are therefore talking about the need to facilitate multi-actor collaboration that facilitates the generation of distributed leadership in the face of an extremely complex challenge such as that pursued by the València 2030 Climate Mission, involving the entire innovation ecosystem of the city and even of the territory.

Figure 5: The helixes of the València innovation ecosystem

The city of València proposes a process of social and ecosystem engagement of the city for the co-creation and continuous enrichment of the Climate City Contract (CCC) with 3 levels of distributed and complementary teams and leaderships acting simultaneously to accelerate the systemic transition:

Level 1 The Mission Community: engagement with and accession to the Climate City Contract (CCC) by the municipal teams of València City Council and the companies and organisations of its local public sector.

Level 3 The Mission Alliance: engagement with and accession to the Climate City Contract (CCC) of all actors and people in the city.

# The mission community

The breaking down of silos in the city's ecosystem must also take place and be born in València City Council itself, as the political organisation that governs and manages the city, including its local agencies and foundations.
AJUNTAMENT DE VALENCIA
Mission
València 2030
Climate Action Plan (CAP)
citiES 2030

València City Council, Las NAVES Foundation (local innovation agency) and València Climate and Energy Foundation (local Climate and Energy agency) have created their own Mission Teams working since 2021 in the Mission Community in the form of an interdepartmental and inter-institutional working team of the 3 organisations and open to the ecosystem to address the Climate Mission from the perspective, again, of distributed leadership also in our own administration.

This community has a weekly work agenda called Mission Day, where the progress of the different work packages of the Mission are shared and decisions related to the action are agreed upon.

It is currently made up of 40 people from 10 different areas of municipal management, from the foundations themselves, as well as representatives from the University and from companies with demonstration projects. The community is completed with the two NetZeroCities City Advisors that have recently joined and with our involvement in the Collaboration Platform for the Climate Neutrality of Spanish Cities, citiES 2030.

# The Mission's networked transition team

The Mission Community is integrated with the Mission Transition RoundTable, which is a networked space where some of the main transition actors from different parts of the ecosystem come together.

In this logic of multi-actor collaboration and distributed leadership, it is also essential to incorporate the vision of multilevel governance. In our specific case, this multilevel governance has a clear orientation towards our regional government, the Generalitat Valenciana, whose key presence is strongly represented in this networked transition team.

The following figure shows the composition of this transition team in the València Climate Mission network.

# The Mission Alliance

Finally, this ecosystem for transition is joined by the local platform or coalition of actors committed to transition and the Climate Mission, which we call the Climate Mission Alliance.

The Climate Mission Alliance is an initiative of València City Council that seeks to join the efforts of the whole city to make València a climate neutral city by 2030. The Alliance arises from València's commitment to the fight against climate change and for a just ecological transition. Achieving a sustainable and emission-free city implies a total transformation of our daily lives, our homes, our streets, our consumption habits and our economic and productive system. Therefore, the whole of society, from individuals to administrations and companies, is called upon to participate in this transformation. In short, the path that leads València to be a city free of fossil fuels and emissions has to be a shared and consensual path for the whole city, as the transformation will also impact everyone.

Therefore, the Alliance seeks to promote joint action and commitment towards the same direction: the València 2030 Climate Mission. It reflects that all citizens, private companies, public administrations, social organisations, academic centres and the media are united and committed to this joint mission. In this way, the aim is to achieve systemic and root changes in the city, to be led and enjoyed by its neighbours.

The The Mission Alliance is articulated through a call to the model of the 5 helices of the ecosystem composed of the private sector, the public sector, academia, civil society and citizens and the media. In short, it is a call to join forces in the same direction from any sector, activity, technology and source of knowledge: the Climate Mission.

The The Mission Alliance aims to create a constellation of hundreds of productive and social transformations (public policies and concrete, demonstrative, entrepreneurial and personal innovations) from across the València ecosystem that have a systemic impact on the climate mission.

Moreover, at the same time as mobilising action by Valencian society, information and tools are provided to facilitate this action. For example, there are many people who want to have a more sustainable lifestyle, or small businesses that want to reduce their energy costs. The Alliance offers them a way to make their efforts and actions visible, but it also offers them information, tools, good practices and, in short, a community where they can learn, train and make their action as useful and efficient as possible. Seeing that other people, other companies or other public administrations are involved for the same objective motivates more people and organisations to participate and form part of the community that is transforming Valencia into a better city in which to live.

The Climate Mission Alliance is made up of 4 levels:

Engaged Citizenship is at the heart of the Alliance, as it has the power to bring about major changes in the city through its habits, the way it consumes, or the way it travels. There will be no green transition and no mission success without engaged citizens.
The Joined entities are small businesses and neighbourhood associations that, on a voluntary basis, contribute to making Valencia a more sustainable city through changes in their daily operations.

Ambassador Organisations are benchmarks for their clear and ambitious commitment to the Climate Mission. They are entities with greater capacity for action and innovation and, therefore, with greater responsibility.
The Influential Figures are people known and loved by Valencian society, who believe in and fight for a more sustainable world, and have the capacity to get their message across to the public, where the Public Administration and the other agents of the The Mission Alliance would not be able to reach.

This information and tools to accelerate involvement in the Mission Alliance will soon be openly accessible on the Alliance's website:

https://alianza.missionsValencia.eu/index.php

Currently, there are 176 Ambassador Organisations that already belong to the The Mission Alliance and are waiting to learn about the Climate City Contract (CCC) in order to focus their commitments and actions for accession. Of these Ambassador Organisations, the following are worth highlighting:

25 are Business Associations representing 5,651 companies in different economic sectors in the city.
are professional associations and civil society associations representing 128,061 people.
The other 132 organisations are individual member organisations and companies.

The distribution of ambassador organisations by ecosystem helix is as follows:

# PART B - PATHWAYS TOWARDS CLIMATE NEUTRALITY BY 2030

This module represents the core of the Climate Neutral Action Plan 2030, consisting of the essential elements: scenarios, strategic objectives, impacts, portfolios of actions and indicators for monitoring, evaluation and learning.

# MODULE B-1 : Climate Neutral Scenarios and Impact Pathways

Impact pathways, short- and long-term outcomes, and direct and indirect impacts (co-benefits) are indicated here.

Within the indirect impacts, the co-benefits, these have been collected here with a qualitative assessment by sector and sub-sector. It should be noted that a first quantitative and monetised evaluation of some of the co-benefits has been carried out and is shown in table C-3-1 of this Annex. Their documentation will be explained in this section. The economic model used allows a first economic evaluation of these co-benefits to obtain the Return on Investment and the economic case for neutrality. This information is essential to motivate the involvement of the ecosystem while building loyalty and participation in climate action. It is envisaged to include greater precision and more documented quantification of these co-benefits in future iterations of the model and the Climate City Contract (CCC).

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

When explaining the impact pathways that have an effect on the Climate Action Plan (CAP) we propose in València (and its portfolio of transformative actions) it is necessary to consider two key factors.

Firstly, the need to take a broader view of the sectors and sub-sectors that have an impact on climate neutrality than those merely considered by the model we have been working with. Thus, in addition to the four main sectors defined: Transport, Buildings and Heating, Electricity and Waste (and their corresponding subsectors), València concludes that the city's climate neutrality can only be achieved if in this model we also consider another series of sectors which, under the logic of the València 2030 Climate Mission, we call Emission Impact Domains, such as Renaturalisation, Biodiversity and Resilience, Economy and Industry, and Urban Planning and Habitat. These Domains are essential, among others, to be able to have an impact on emissions reductions, as well as to generate synergies with the Climate Adaptation Mission of which we are also part. It should also be noted that, although at present these Domains do not have their own sub-sectors, in future iterations of this Climate Action Plan (CAP) we will work to build them.

Secondly, the Climate Action Plan (CAP) presented below is built on the basis of the València 2030 Urban Strategy and its associated Action Plan. This is because in its very conception and construction, the Innovation Missions approach and, above all, the València 2030 Climate Mission has been at the centre, as is well demonstrated by the fact that around 90% of its lines of action can have an impact on this Mission. Consequently, our portfolio of transformative actions has been configured according to the concepts of the Urban Strategy:

Programme: This is the main concept around which the Local Action Plan of the València 2030 Urban Strategy is articulated. It refers to an ordered grouping of lines of action and specific projects in accordance with the municipal competences and the current organisational structure of València City Council. It describes the main areas of action on which the Urban Strategy, through the public policies of the City Council, should have an impact over the next decade.
Line of action: This makes it possible to specify the Local Action Plan's programmes, defining specific lines of work on which they should be developed.
Demonstration projects: These are actions that can be implemented in a relatively short period of time (some of which have already been implemented) and are characterised by their capacity to demonstrate in practice some of the key elements of the city model developed by this strategy. They are used as a source of learning for replication and scaling up to other areas of the city.

This approach can be represented graphically as follows, in which we have "crossed" the Programmes and Lines of Action of the València 2030 Urban Strategy with the Sectors and sub-sectors of the model, as well as with the Emissions Impact Domains that we have added from the València 2030 Climate Mission³

|   |  Type of action | AU Strategic Infrastructure Programme  |
|   |  Description of the action | This comprehensive action pursues the development and adaptation of the city's strategic infrastructures in terms of their contribution to a more sustainable and prosperous city. The focus is mainly on the railway infrastructure within the framework of the Mediterranean corridor. The interventions envisaged in this action will make it possible to strengthen, on the one hand, the strategic state and international positioning of València as an economic hub of innovation and competitiveness and, on the other hand, to promote the decarbonisation and sustainability of the city's modes of transport, as well as the adaptation and resilience of the city in terms of climate. Specifically, the aim is to make progress in:
• Construction of the access channel located on Avenida Federico García Lorca between the Bulevar Sur and the new Central Station of València. It consists of a set of underground tracks underneath the current access roads to València. The length of the canal is 1,500 m and it is buried on two levels. In this project, the well-known scalextric -the Giorgeta viaduct- will also be demolished and the space now occupied by the above-ground tracks will be completely freed up for the green development of the future García Lorca boulevard.
• Construction of a new Central Station in València to replace the two existing ones. It will be located in an intermediate space between the North and Sorolla stations and will accommodate all rail traffic. The new station will be a through  |

|   |  | station instead of its current sack-bottom layout. On the surface, the station will consist of a large building located between the Gran Vía de Germanías and the current station building. This new building will house most of the accesses and exits of the new facilities and the station's support services. The work on the new station will have continuity at its southern end with the Access Channel and at the other end with the Through Tunnel.

• Construction of the Through Tunnel. The València Railway Passageway Axis consists of the connection between the Central Station and the València-Barcelona line to the north of the city in order to convert the station into a passageway and eliminate its current arrangement in a cul-de-sac, thus avoiding the undesirable effects of carrying out backward manoeuvres in the area around the station. Two new urban stations are planned (Aragón and Universidad) with connections to the metro and tram lines. All types of trains (high-speed, long-distance, regional and commuter trains) are expected to run through the tunnel.

• Burying of the Serrería tracks.  |

|   |  Description of the action | This action focuses on the recovery of public space for people in order to have a network of pedestrian-priority and naturalised connections throughout the city. The action aims to promote healthy mobility and lifestyles by transforming public spaces into people-friendly environments, guaranteeing people's safety and autonomy when moving around. It also aims to create spaces for leisure and neighbourhood coexistence that favour economic activity and social cohesion in the city's neighbourhoods, integrating the gender perspective. It also aims to guarantee adequate interconnectivity between neighbourhoods and the city's main facilities, promoting the complete articulation of the internal network of pedestrian routes, connecting the points of special concentration of people.
Demonstration project: Town Hall Square. The Town Hall Square constitutes the urban centre of València and is the most representative public space in the city, playing a strategic role in the  |

construction of the urban model in which, since past times, the activity of the Valèncian city has been agglutinated. The initiative consists of the comprehensive redevelopment of the square, with the guarantee of quality that comes with a call for ideas, in order to promote its urban regeneration by improving its environmental conditions, mobility, especially for pedestrians, accessibility, air quality, commercial and festive uses, such as flower stalls and the shooting and viewing of mascletás and fireworks events, uses, urban landscape, etc. to restore its qualities as a place to stay, for leisure and civic coexistence.

Demonstration project: the Queen's Square. It has consisted of the remodelling of a space of some 12,000 square metres, where the city's central streets of La Pau, San Vicente and Santa Catalina converge, for the use and enjoyment of the public to enhance the protected monumental environment, with a full view of the Cathedral and the Micalet, and which has been equipped with seating areas and new trees. In addition, it has been contemplated the deployment of shade, the installation of nebulisers and new services in the refurbished adjoining car park, with 300 spaces and electric recharging points. The remodelling has been designed and enriched based on the needs of the residents through various participatory processes.

Demonstration project: Superilla de la Petxina. Almost complete pedestrianisation of the streets of Palleter and Calixto III and the sections between the latter and Literato Gabriel Miró, Juan Llorens, Erudito Orellana and Gran Vía, inverting the space available to the car for pedestrians. In this case, soft urbanisation will be chosen, a method that involves minimal, quick and low-cost work. Through the so-called 'tactical urbanism', a participatory process has been developed for its design.

Demonstration project: Superilla de Orriols. Pedestrianisation of 8.700m2 of the Orriols neighbourhood with gardens, recreational areas and two small meadows. The superblock of the Orriols neighbourhood will cover the entire area between the streets Pare Viñas; Duc de Mandas; San Vicent de Paül and Reig Genovés. It will integrate and connect some spaces already pedestrianised in the area around the traditional historic centre of Orriols, as well as the Ermita garden and the CEIP Bartolomé Cossío primary

|   | Description of the action | The city of València is immersed in a municipal planning review process that covers both structural and detailed planning. The Special Plan of Urban Quality Guidelines is a link between these two levels of planning, the metropolitan structural and the detailed planning of the neighbourhoods. The guidelines aim to establish a framework on which to implement a change of direction in urban planning activity towards urban regeneration based on urban quality as a means of improving people's quality of life. As a result of this work, progress is being made in comprehensive urban planning in the city from the perspective of the 15-minute city with local facilities in the different neighbourhoods of the city.

Demonstration project: Special Plan for Nazaret. Natzaret will be the first neighbourhood to meet the premise of the "15-minute València", i.e. the neighbourhood will be a fifteen-minute walk from any essential public service or facility. The project is divided into four zones within the same neighbourhood, to be divided between Cocoteros, Moreras, Residenciales Sur and Castell de Pop. All the reforms aim to make the Nazaret neighbourhood a greener, more sustainable, safer and more connected to València, the result of a participatory process that has sought the consensus of the residents. It highlights the construction of almost 4,000 new homes, of which almost 800 will have "some kind of protection" from the City Council, which translates into 20% of the new constructions. This will make the Nazaret neighbourhood one of the urban nuclei with the highest percentage of protected housing in the city. This new plan aims to build a new market, the creation of pedestrian corridors, a new church square, a new Day Centre and a friendly transition to the huerta de La Punta.

Demonstration project: Cabanyal-Canyamelar Special Plan. The Special Plan for the neighbourhood foresees the creation of three greenways, the landscaping of the end of Avenida Blasco Ibáñez, the limitation of tourist flats per block to 10%, the protection of the seafront and the maintenance of the construction typology of the neighbourhood with a maximum of 3 storeys. In the Cabanyal there will be between 850 and 1,000 houses from the public housing stock to  |

|   |  Type of action | AU Programme 15-min València (15 minutes in València)  |
|   |  Description of the action | New urban developments must respond to the city's need for new housing and facilities. In this sense, it is proposed to unblock and develop different pending developments in the city with criteria of social cohesion, accessibility and sustainability. Urban developments must respond to a Mediterranean approach that combines a link with the territory and a compact, dense, mixed-use city model. Along these lines, the following stand out: 1) Parque Central, linked to the burying of the train tracks and the generation of the Garcia Lorca boulevard to sew together the neighbourhoods of Malilla, Creu Coberta and San Marcelino in accordance with the criteria of a "15-minute city", with local facilities and services; 2) Benimaclet, as a space of opportunity to develop a transition model between the city and the historic huerta, preserving the heritage of the area while guaranteeing a public housing park, green areas with urban gardens and sports, civic, educational and cultural facilities; 3) El Grau, which develops a large green space connected to the Turia Garden, the Desembocadura Park and La Marina, promoting public housing, commercial uses and the weight of the tertiary sector to encourage the establishment of companies and activities that can establish synergies with the Maritime District of Innovation and Creativity. In this way, the aim is to develop a compact neighbourhood that can be an example of a shared city and be integrated into a pole of innovative development, given its proximity to Las Naves, La Harinera and La Marina.  |

An energy community is a new way of generating, using and managing energy at a local level through the cooperation of different agents (citizens, local administration and SMEs). Through this new figure, citizens and the rest of the participating entities become an active part of the energy sector, being able to produce and share renewable and local energy, offer energy efficiency services or promote sustainable mobility modes, among others.
Thus, we intend to accelerate the pace and change the scale to replicate and expand the deployment of a network of neighbourhood energy communities, thus changing the energy model of the city. To this end, actions such as the analysis of the photovoltaic potential of the city's roofs; training and involvement of individuals and  |

|   |  Description of the action | The Energy One-Stop Shops are a key tool to get citizens and local actors involved in the energy transition and to facilitate their participation in the new efficient, emission-free, decentralised and democratic energy model.

The offices provide local advice on energy rights, energy bills, energy efficiency or renewable energy production in communities. They also serve as a link with the citizens of other projects developed in the neighbourhoods, such as 50/50 programmes, Neighbourhood Energy Communities (CEB), rehabilitation programmes, etc. These offices respond to specific questions: how to save energy, how to produce renewables, what to do if I can't pay the electricity bill at the end of the month, etc., offering practical advice and technical and financial assistance to act as catalysts for the energy transition in València.

Thus, we intend to deploy a network of energy advice offices in the city. To this end, actions will be carried out such as: detection and involvement of relevant actors, definition of the services and management model, preparation of spaces and training of human teams, preparation of action protocols, materials and guides, development of management tools and technical support, implementation of the advisory service, accompaniment and promotion of the EBCs and measurement of results.

Finally, this network of physical offices will be accompanied by a digital office that offers online services, encompasses the information, materials and tools used by the physical offices, and makes it possible to reach a more varied public in terms of age and geographical location.

Demonstration project: Energy Office in Algirós. The first Energy Office has been operational since 2019 in the district of Algirós. It has a dedicated team of 5 people to inform, advise and accompany citizens and the city’s ecosystem on energy issues:  |

|   |  Type of action | AU Energy Transition Programme  |
|   |  Description of the action | 50/50 is a recognised example of practical cooperation and implementation of local initiatives to address climate change and energy transition. The idea, already created and tested in Germany in the 1990s, boils down to promoting energy efficiency and energy savings in public schools, whereby 50% of the energy savings achieved are returned to the schools through a financial contribution that the school can use as it wishes, while the remaining 50% is savings that are reinvested in further energy efficiency measures in the school. The aim, therefore, is to promote a new energy culture among different groups in society (students, teachers, school management team, management team, families...), while at the same time achieving energy and economic savings in the short term, making the power of citizen action visible.
Based on the experience of more than 4 years implementing this action in the city, mainly in schools and institutes, it is proposed to change the scale and expand the focus of the 50/50  |

The idea, therefore, is not only to scale up the initiative to reach all the educational centres in València, but also to apply this environmental education and energy saving service to other public and private groups in the city. To this end, actions are envisaged such as: communication of the programme and involvement of interested parties, creation of a badge and a prize for participating entities, creation of multidisciplinary teams for its implementation, development of methodologies, protocols and materials, implementation of the programme, dynamisation of the work sessions, linking with other projects and initiatives to combat climate change, collaboration with the CEBs, taking advantage of the roofs of participating buildings for collective installations, etc.  |

In addition, society has suffered from decades of a centralised and non-transparent energy model that left very little room for action to the end consumer, leading to distrust, disconnection and apathy. Now, however, we need an educated, informed and empowered citizenry to lead the energy transition towards a radically new model that is renewable, decentralised, emission-free, democratic and fair.  |

|   |  | Citizens must be put at the centre, not only to accelerate the necessary changes, but also to ensure that no one is left behind. For this reason, it is proposed to implement a massive communication and awareness-raising campaign to bring about a new energy culture among the population. This campaign will have three interrelated and complementary objectives: - Raise awareness: convey the importance of changing the energy model to fight climate change and defend the right to energy for the entire population. Emphasise the opportunity that energy change offers to transform the city into a pleasant, sustainable, green, prosperous and inclusive place. - Motivate action: provide sufficient information and tools to motivate citizens to participate and promote energy transition projects, such as: energy renovation of houses and buildings, energy communities, collective self-consumption, shared electric mobility systems. - To add value: to make good practices and success stories of citizens, public administrations and private companies visible. The aim is to offer real examples of what the new energy model means, to bring energy closer to citizens, to break down mistrust and to inspire action by other people and entities. This campaign includes, among others, the following aspects: - Organise talks, events and workshops with citizens and different professional sectors to discuss energy and environmental concepts, reaching all areas of the city. For example, on basic and simple guidelines to generate energy self-learning. - Produce guides, manuals, infographics, audiovisual resources, posters, creativities, interviews, press releases, etc. for the press, web, social networks, transport media, advertising media. - Collaborate with the five helixes of the city to multiply the impact of the campaign through replication and decentralisation: side events, sectoral talks, production of posters, use of campaign stamps, etc.  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Type of action | AU Water, Sanitation and Waste Programme |
| Description of the action | The reconfiguration of consumption flows is essential to close the circularity of the urban economy, and involves working on the initial design of products and services, promoting local production and distribution, facilitating repair and reuse, and maximising recycling and final recovery. All of this so that the products, materials and resources used in the city remain in use for as long as possible. The implementation of these new flows requires, in many cases, the development and implementation of innovative technologies, solutions and business models: new packaging materials, new models of ownership of goods and provision of services, new concepts of use and reuse of clothing, new materials, technologies and models of construction and housing, new systems for planning the purchase and consumption of food, etc.
Demonstrator project: Proposed solutions to "Challenge 4: Valènçian Circular and Sustainable Economy", of the Preliminary Market Consultation for Innovative Public Procurement. |

|   |  Description of the action | This action particularly affects the so-called neighbourhood gardens, which are of particular strategic interest due to their proximity and service to citizens. The selection of green spaces will be made taking into account the need for cohesion in the city and to compensate for existing imbalances, including actions planned for the creation of new accessible gardens without architectural barriers or the rehabilitation of existing ones in the different neighbourhoods and towns. The action also includes the development of secondary connections between these gardens and large city centres and green corridors through the renaturation of roads and traffic axes, as well as the elimination of architectural barriers in the Turia Garden. It is essential to consider neighbourhood gardens not in isolation, but as nodes in a wider green infrastructure system. Demonstration project: Trini Simó Garden. Due to its emblematic and identifying character, inspired by the Valèncian agricultural landscape and the result of a long-standing demand from citizens. Its location makes it a green articulating element between the Jardí de les Hespèrides, the Gran Vía Fernando el Católico, the neighbourhood, the San Josep school, the Paseo de la Petxina and the Túria garden.  |

|  Action plan | Name of the action | RBR-2 Large urban parks with inclusive design  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Type of action | AU Green Neighbourhoods Programme  |
|   |  Description of the action | Large city parks and gardens include those green areas that, due to their size, facilities, or historical and cultural character, acquire a relevance within the green infrastructure and facilities that transcends and goes beyond the scale of the neighbourhood. Thus, these large parks offer a service to citizens regardless of their proximity to their place of residence.
Precisely because of their size, they can house a greater diversity of green and even aquatic ecosystems, making them key spaces within the city's green infrastructure, favouring the establishment and habitability of different species of flora and fauna. They also allow the integration of different uses and sports, play and leisure facilities that favour an active life in healthy environments with high environmental quality.
This action focuses on expanding the network of large parks in our city, turning them into inclusive places designed for everyone, in areas such as Benimamet, Benimaclet, Cabañal, Benicalap, Arrancapins... Thus, new parks such as Carolinas Park, or the extension of others, such as Parque Central, Rambleta, or Benicalap, make up a balanced mesh of large green spaces with a high capacity to contribute to improving air quality and environmental temperature, in turn providing these areas with healthy environments and supporting urban biodiversity.
Demonstration project: Carolinas Park. The location of the park, on the western urban edge of Benimàmet, is the culmination of the existing Linear Park in a large green space with sports and  |

The new promenade aims to establish a space for interaction that allows conservation and environmental aspects to be resolved, making the system more sustainable in the face of adverse meteorological effects and, above all, catering for the use of the public. The new edge aims to offer the public a variety of alternative uses. A space with friendly shade, a place that offers spaces for leisure, living, sport, play and strolling, while at the same time promoting the use of the current leisure, consumer and restaurant areas. The idea is to develop a new renaturalised landscape where a dune system stabilises the sand with plant variants and suitable trees.  |

The project, which in its final form will have to count on the social and political dialogue required for an urban development of this magnitude, is divided into four zones: the first, with 86,000 square metres, in the Nazaret neighbourhood; the second, Pont de Drassanes, with 7,800 metres; the third, PAI del Grao, with 112,000; and the fourth, Oceanogràfic. The initial phase is part of the agreement with the port of València, which has ceded 9.5 hectares. Its design is based on an international ideas competition and includes a gender perspective. |

|   |  Type of action | AU Programme Coastal regeneration and territorial green integration  |
|   |  Description of the action | Green corridors are key itineraries connecting the different elements of the green infrastructure of the city and the metropolitan area. The following three proposals will be studied. The first would be the Playas del Norte-Jardín del Turia-Albufera to connect three of the key elements of the city's green infrastructure with the greatest identity and environmental value. It would integrate the Desembocadura Park and would require recovering at least part of the land of the Logistics Activities Zone (ZAL) and reconverting it into a large green area that could recover agricultural activities. In this way, the Jardín del Túria would have a continuity from the northern beaches and the Albufera to the Parque Natural del Túria in Riba-Roja. The second would be Huerta Burjassot-Partida de Dalt to overcome the fragmentation derived from the concentration of infrastructures and establish a connecting space of regional importance between Horta Nord and Horta Sud. The third would be Huerta de Alboraya-city to be able to move from the orchards of Masquefa and Sant Llorenç, as well as from the urban edges of Torrefiel and Benimaclet to the very centre of the city through a linear green space. These actions will be respectful of farms and farmers' activities, with the preservation of the latter being the first objective to be pursued.  |

This action aims to improve the Huerta-City relationship. It aims to make the city's ring roads, which separate the urban system from the orchard, more permeable. To this end, it proposes using wooded areas, preserving the farmhouses and orchards that have been left on the city side, crossing the ring road and improving the number and quality of the paths to link up with the main roads leading to the orchard. This green infrastructure aims to resolve the transition between the two ecosystems, satisfying the needs of the city's inhabitants for quality green spaces and reducing  |

The regeneration will involve artificially recharging the beaches of l'Arbre del Gos, El Saler and La Garrofera by restoring the current shore line to its position in 1965 and restoring the previous dynamic equilibrium, as well as the extension of the Gola de Puchol, which will provide a partial barrier to the longitudinal transport of sediments. The possibility of implementing other possible regeneration measures, complementary to the artificial recharge of sand, such as artificial reefs, will be studied in order to provide a definitive  |

In this sense, the placement of artificial reefs will be studied in some points of the southern coastline of the city, as this is an option that has been carried out in other parts of the Mediterranean coast with positive results.

All measures and actions to comply with the local forest fire prevention plan for the Devesa de l'Albufera, in force in València City Council, will be accelerated. In addition, the system of water cannons for fire prevention will be put into operation, as well as the complementary measures that the municipal technicians establish to comply with the modification of Legislative Decree 1/2021, of 18 June, of the Council of approval of the revised text of the Law on land management, urban planning and landscape, by means of Law 7/2021, of 29 December, of the Generalitat, on fiscal measures, administrative and financial management and organisation of the Generalitat 2022, in its Sixth Additional Provision, which establishes measures for the prevention of forest fires in housing developments, population centres, buildings and installations located on forest land and in the area of forest influence.

Likewise, the contract for dredging the canals and irrigation channels of l'Albufera de València will be extended, as well as a pilot dredging project in specific areas of l'Albufera lake that the municipal technicians deem appropriate, respecting the environmental values of the natural park, especially in those areas of the lake with registered historical ullals and at the entrances of ravines to the lake.  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Type of action | AU Sustainable and local food programme  |
|   |  Description of the action | Strengthen and re-territorialise the municipal agri-food system, focusing on the values and potential of a city-region agrosystem and providing an open-air public space that can be used as a reference or meeting point for local, sustainable, healthy and culturally rooted products and the city's population. At the same time, we aim to transform the city's agri-food culture in favour of more sustainable productive, social and environmental models, making progress in the development of fairer value chains that can improve the profitability of farms.

Specifically, we will: promote a series of coordinated sustainable and local food projects in the Mercavalència area; generate and scale up a network of direct sales platforms for local agri-food products with environmental and social criteria in the city; and develop the concept of healthy, sustainable and fair public procurement, linked to local production, in all the City Council's food service and supply contracts, with a gender focus and special attention to groups in situations of vulnerability.

Demonstrator project: Horta_Cuina - Ecotira. The Ecotira has been developed in 2022 as a pilot project, articulated as a cooperative collection centre. In the pilot phase, 10 schools in the metropolitan area of València were served. After this pilot test, the project is now immersed in an important leap in scale.

Demonstrator project: Redona. Based on a diagnosis, the project aims to comprehensively address the management of food waste in Mercavalència, facilitating both the systematisation of data and the use of fruit and vegetables in consumable condition by food aid organisations.

Its main objective is to ensure that València attracts international talent, retains local talent, and promotes investment and the creation of national and international projects, positioning the city as the main technological and innovation hub in the Mediterranean. To this end, this action seeks to develop new poles of economic activity based on innovation, technology, knowledge, the environment, culture and design that attract global investment and contribute to the consolidation of economic activity with high added value in the city. All this, as a driving force to improve the investment climate and boost entrepreneurship, thus consolidating a favourable environment for the attraction of capital and the proliferation of SMEs, as well as for the growth of the activity of people working on a self-employed basis. It also aims to educate and foster new talents and ways of thinking, providing a space where the growth of high-tech businesses can accelerate and flourish and economic support mechanisms for the development of these businesses. Finally, the programme will facilitate the generation of synergies between the different agents that form part of the city's innovative ecosystem. Local productive sectors, SMEs, startups, universities and research centres will be the main actors in this new, smarter and more resilient economic model. Demonstrator project: Open Labs. Creation of a network of Open Innovation laboratories, open and cooperative, in which to research, develop and test specific solutions with cutting-edge enabling technologies in the new economy (5G-6G, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, Biotechnology, etc.).

|   |  Type of action | AU Innovative District Vara de Quart Programme  |
|   |  Description of the action | The reconversion of the Vara de Quart industrial estate into an innovative district will be the largest urban regeneration operation in our city. It will involve the reconversion of this industrial area of almost 60 hectares into a new district of the city based on the 15-minute city model, making room for new tertiary, residential and educational uses. This new compact area with a diversity of uses will house enough space for the implementation of new companies and training centres specialising in different areas such as the agri-food sector, cultural and creative industries, digital industries and renewable energies. It will thus become a great hub of innovation and knowledge that will not only revitalise the industrial estate and the neighbouring districts (San Isidro, Tres Forques, La Fuensanta), but will also aspire to be the new economic engine of the city, and even of the Valèncian Community. For the renovation, it is essential to modify the general planning in order to renovate in a profound, detailed and at the same time flexible way the current uses and conditions, so as to establish the necessary ecosystem for the success of the transformation. A green planning in the sense of mobility, energy and waste generation, also promoting the mobility of the 10-15 minutes city, electric and sustainable. The modification of the planning should be accompanied  |

|   | simultaneously by, among others: 1) An infrastructure plan; 2) A sustainability plan with the objective that Vara de Quart becomes a reference point in

It is also intended to create a Citizen Laboratory in the vicinity of the Vara de Quart industrial estate, in one of its adjoining neighbourhoods, as an element of social integration and a link and space for citizenship. The citizen laboratory is an example of a wave of new citizen spaces that aim to encourage and promote innovation and creativity, with special emphasis on technological elements. To this end, it must become a meeting and coordination point for social innovation projects and the dissemination of good practices. At the same time, the laboratory is to become a resource for the secondary schools in the neighbourhoods nearby, as a new facility to complement their existing physical facilities. Likewise, it will be a platform for relations with the spaces of the Innovative District, as well as with the different poles of economic activity that will be developed.

On the other hand, the main educational centres in the surrounding area should in the future be potential allies of the district, with which joint training strategies will have to be agreed upon so that potential productive specialisations or emerging sectors resulting from the activities of the industrial estate are in line with the same proposals for training specialisations of these centres. To this end, all the centres located in the neighbouring districts, both public and private and subsidised, will be identified so that, in a second phase, contact can be made with them and their training properties can be studied in depth, proposing specific programmes linked to the areas of specialisation of the Innovative District.

Finally, with regard to the governance of the Innovative District, this must be based on the pact between the different levels, public (City Council, Govern CV, Universities) and private agents. Only through the agreement and complicity of the different public and private agents that make up the District’s Quintuple Helix will it be possible to make the Innovative District that the city of València and, by extension, the Valènician Community as a whole, a reality.  |

It is an urban space with a unique character and opportunities. It aspires to be a benchmark in Europe as a focus of attraction for talent and companies and projects linked to innovation, creativity and design; a centre for the economic, cultural and social life of the territory, with the services of a technologically advanced sports marina in the Mediterranean and an efficient management model committed to the objectives of sustainable development.  |

|   |  | Along these lines, La Marina is called upon to play a fundamental role in the activation and productive revitalisation of the València waterfront, while at the same time favouring citizen appropriation of the old port of València and incorporating efficient management based on sustainability. Far from the exclusivity boasted by other marinas around the world, the València marina has become a civic space par excellence as an increasingly comfortable, accessible, sustainable and friendly environment, which includes a first-class cultural, gastronomic and leisure offer.

Thus, in addition to serving as a dynamic centre for the territory and a beacon for the knowledge and innovation economy, we also aim to promote La Marina as an advanced technological centre for the nautical sector, promoting the creation of the Nautical Training Centre and the Workshop School for boat repair, facilitating digitalisation, promoting the blue economy and increasing nautical promotion actions. It also aims to boost nautical activity with initiatives such as the construction of a nautical village for commerce and services, the construction of a sports centre, the development of a commercial area, and the construction and operation of an industrial dry dock, among others.  |

This translates into the general objective of consolidating the destination on the solid foundations of improving the well-being of residents, reducing the carbon footprint, combating climate change, digital transformation, creating value and improving governance. To this end, it is committed to promoting the destination's tourism transformation based on four vectors: green and sustainable transition; improving energy efficiency, digital transition and competitiveness.
With regard to the green transition, actions against the climate emergency associated with tourism activity are incorporated: actions to reduce the water footprint and plastic pollution; promoting the consumption of local products or improving the management of unique protected  |

natural areas such as the Albufera or the Huerta. In line with the València 2030 Climate Mission, carbon neutrality actions are planned through real-time calculation actions in tourist organisations, effective reduction of emissions, compensation measures, and promotion of sustainable tourist mobility, among others. All these actions are aimed at making València the first carbon neutral tourist destination by 2025. With regard to the digital transition, the tourism transformation pursued by the programme is accompanied and supported by a digital transformation, both of the environmental management tools and of the promotion and marketing tools. From this third vector, València will complete the implementation of a Global Platform for destination management and intelligence, gaining in knowledge and efficiency. Its technological capacity will take a qualitative leap forward by incorporating new tools for information and interaction with tourists, and for management and sales support, which will be extended to the sector as a whole, as well as new heritage interpretation systems.

All of this is based on the proposals of value and identity that emanate from the Product Programme strategy and which generates initiatives such as the promotion of local gastronomy, boosting music and design as a tourist attraction, making first-rate resources such as the Holy Grail visible or the progressive incorporation of universal accessibility to the offer, as the fourth vector of tourist transformation that defines this programme.

Demonstration project: Tourism Sustainability Observatory. To strengthen the governance of the programme and the Tourism Sustainability Plan 2022-2024, with the support of the Consell Municipal de Turisme, a Tourism Sustainability Observatory will be set up to complement the technical management of the Plan with expert knowledge.

Demonstrator project: Global platform for destination management and tourism intelligence. This demonstration project includes the expansion of the tourism information system (SIT), with new dashboards, integrating all the functionalities linked to the management of Visit València and also incorporating the professional CRM and the various digital marketing tools under

|   |  Type of action | UA València creative city and culture programme  |
|   |  Description of the action | This action can be summarised as the goal of positioning creativity and cultural industries at the heart of the city's local development plan, cooperating both locally and internationally in the field to consolidate València, City of Creativity and Culture. From the point of view of creativity, València is positioned as a creative city thanks to design. This is demonstrated, for example, by its candidacy to be recognised as a Creative City by UNESCO, a work that forms part of this programme. Likewise, the distinction of the city as World Design Capital 2022 is another of the elements around which this action revolves. Thus, under the protection of this distinction, which has enabled the activation of more than 100 events, the action aims to generate a story that appeals to the whole of society, positioning it as a tool for transformation capable of improving the quality of life and boosting the economy.
Beyond design, the city has important strengths as a creative and cultural city that this programme aims to further consolidate. These strengths are based on sectors such as comics, illustration, the audiovisual sector, the performing arts, music, literature, the visual arts and the Fallas, which are important generators of employment, wealth, well-being and social cohesion. In this way, the aim is to improve the cultural positioning of València within the Spanish and Mediterranean context, as well as to support female and male artists in all phases of the development of their projects in order to value the sense of experimentation, of dreaming and the new  |

|   |  | languages resulting from this whole chrysalis of creative impacts.
Finally, this action is directly linked to Las Fallas and other local festivities such as La Gan Fira de València, a festive and cultural event of reference in the city. In this sense, the programme aims to continue strengthening Las Fallas, not only for its ability to attract visitors, but also from the point of view that it is a way of understanding and thinking about the city and its neighbourhoods and, therefore, it is necessary for all citizens to participate in them. Likewise, and clearly related to the València 2030 Climate Mission, progress will be made in making Las Fallas a festival that progressively incorporates the vector of sustainability in its development.
With all this in mind, we will make progress in the creation of new cultural centres, in the renovation of existing cultural spaces (such as the Municipal Newspaper Library and the Municipal Historical Library and Fullana Library), in the rehabilitation of heritage (including the Lonja de la Seda), in the UNESCO Creative City candidacy, in working towards our status as World Design Capital 2022 and in the sustainability of the Fallas and the festive sector as a whole.  |

This includes several areas of action. Firstly, the Port of València in its strategy to gain competitiveness has included among its  |

|   | objectives to align itself with the European Green Pact and aspires to become a climate neutral port in 2030 through its strategy "ValènciaPort 2030, zero emissions". This strategy focuses on boosting digitalisation, electrification, renewable production and innovation to reduce the main sources of emissions such as ships calling at the port, container terminals, nautical services (such as tugboats) and land transport. The achievement of these objectives implies a commitment to decarbonisation as an engine for attracting talent, knowledge, research and innovation, as well as the integration of the port with the transport networks, especially the railways, and the promotion of regional governance. Secondly, from the perspective of adaptation to climate change, it is necessary to minimise and compensate for the negative externalities that the port generates for the city and its metropolitan area, both in terms of mobility and the effects on the southern coastline. To this end, rail freight transport modes and their connection with the Mediterranean corridor and the Atlantic corridor must be boosted until train use quotas similar to those of the largest European ports are achieved. Likewise, progress must be made in the logistics coordination system with the other ports of the València Port Authority (València-Gandia-Sagunto). On the other hand, direct correction and compensation mechanisms must be established and implemented to mitigate the negative impacts on the territory in coordination with the different agents involved in terms of guaranteeing the climatic resilience of the city and its surroundings. In particular, the competent authorities must guarantee compliance with all environmental regulations regarding the development of the port and the corrective measures foreseen in the 2007 Environmental Impact Statement must be carried out to compensate for the current tilting of the northern beaches (Cabañal and Malvarrosa), as well as the serious regression of the southern beaches (Pinedo, Salero, Perellonet, etc.) with the consequent risks to the ecosystem of the Devesa del Saler and the Albufera. In this sense, an environmental impact study is required to analyse the impacts in terms of mobility, use of materials and landscape. Thirdly, it is important to advance in new forms of port-city relations by permeabilising the urban border of the port,  |

|   |  | recovering the obsolete port heritage and creating new opportunities for public uses. To this end, it is necessary to advance in a framework of multi-level governance in which the city gains a presence in the decisions.

The Special Plan for South Zone 1 of the port of València, which forms part of the Port Space Delimitation Document (DEUP) of the port of València, transfers and defines in detail the details of the specific agreement reached by the City Council of València and the APV, which was approved in February 2017. This initiative is the result of the city-port relationship strategy, in which, in addition to the APV and the City Council, the port community and entities of the city also participate. With the plan, the APV is earmarking 230,000 square metres of port territory, adjacent to the Nazaret neighbourhood, for citizen use.  |

|   | Type of action | Cross-cutting action with impact on all sectors and Emission Impact Domains of the València 2030 Climate Mission.  |
|   |  Description of the action | A Carbon Neutral District (CND) can be a neighbourhood, a village or a specific area of the city that achieves a high degree of energy self-sufficiency, a decarbonisation of all its activity and an absorption of CO2 emissions, so that its clean greenhouse emissions are zero.

To this end, it is necessary to unify a multitude of transformative initiatives in order to apply them in a coordinated and ambitious manner in the same area of the city. In this way, the aim is to enhance the synergies between them and achieve a multiplier effect of transformation of the different sectors and daily areas of the lives of the people who live there.

In this way, we aim to transform the neighbourhoods concerned in a way that goes far beyond energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The transformations necessary to achieve neutrality involve a radical change in the district that affects all sectors and areas of city life.

At the economic and social level, the sub-programme proposes to use the districts to consolidate by 2030 an urban energy hub capable of generating green jobs, entrepreneurship and leading the green economy towards becoming the city’s main economic sector by 2040.

On the other hand, the work focused on districts allows them to be used as a sandbox for testing, replicating and scaling up systemic innovations in the rest of the city. In this way, they serve as a pole of attraction for private, academic and civil society initiatives, because they join the efforts of the public administration and maximise their impact. The modularity and flexibility of the model allows it to be replicated in other areas of the city, moving towards an emission-neutral city by 2040, district by district.

## B-2.3: Summary of residual emissions strategy

The reduction results provided by the model with the ambitions set for 2030 have been shown in both the emissions gap table A-2-3 and are shown again in C-3-1.

Overall, an 84% reduction in emissions would be achieved with respect to BAU2030. Therefore, this 84% has been taken as a reference to assume that the ambition adopted by the emitting sectors that have been left out of the model, such as industry (in the case of València, especially the port) and agriculture, will also reduce their emissions by 84% with respect to BAU2030.

This results in residual emissions of 16% of BAU2030.

These will be addressed by the emission offsetting systems and removal technologies to be developed.

The strategy to address these residual emissions will give priority to local offset projects, and in particular to sinks and nature-based solutions projects, which also bring great co-benefits, particularly for the ecosystem services they provide and which have become essential for adaptation to climate change (temperature regulation, flood prevention, etc.) and for improving the quality of life in key aspects such as better physical and mental health and in a more democratised way, developing these systems in public spaces and proximity. Priority will therefore be given to these local natural carbon sinks, especially enhancing the current natural park of l'Albufera and the Turia Park (the largest urban park in Spain), increasing the green infrastructure in the city and the metropolitan area, with ecosystems with high carbon sink potential.

València plans to develop a compensation strategy, with local projects. At present, the following references located in the municipality can be mentioned, in different stages of maturity:

The LIFE Wetlands4Climate project, led from Spain by Fundación Global Nature (FGN) together with the University of València, represents an important advance in the knowledge of the carbon balances of Mediterranean wetlands, analysing how much carbon a wetland is really capable of retaining depending on its state of conservation. It also studies which soil, vegetation and water management measures are the most appropriate for maximising carbon sequestration.
HortiGO2, linked to the integral water cycle: The HortiGO pilot project will make it possible to validate the methodology for turning the Valèncian market garden into an official carbon sink. In this way, the CO2 absorption generated in the orchard will be made available to companies and municipalities to offset their emissions through a local project. At the same time, the conservation of the surrounding natural spaces is promoted, their value is recognised and the economic viability of the huerta is contributed to, among many other benefits.
The Albufera Blue Carbon or 'Albluefera' project allows the offsetting of the carbon footprint of the Valèncian business fabric through Nature-Based Solutions in the wetlands and agricultural areas around the perimeter of the Albufera natural park. This project is promoted by ClimateTrade, the blockchain-based climate marketplace, and the Club de Empresas Responsables y Sostenibles de la Comunitat Valènciana.

The two entities have signed a collaboration agreement to offset the carbon footprint of the Valèncian business fabric through Nature Based Solutions (NbS) in the wetlands and agricultural

areas around the perimeter of the Albufera Natural Park. Only companies associated with CE/R+S will join this initiative, so that they can store carbon in the wetland ecosystem through the Blue Carbon methodology, generating a positive impact on the mitigation and adaptation of the climate crisis, while offsetting their emissions.

Green Posidonia, an innovation project of the Folgado Training Centre, subsidised by Missions València 2030. The project aims to promote the circular economy, considering that Posidonia waste can be used to create energy, biostimulants, bioinsecticides and compost, as well as to raise social awareness of the importance of the Posidonia forest. To this end, a pilot project will also be carried out, which consists of repopulating a maritime nursery in the port of València to re-establish the Posidonia oceanica, which has a fundamental value in the protection of biodiversity and in the generation of O2 and reduction of CO2 in the sea. The project aims to provide plant cover for the Mediterranean seabed, which is the main carbon sink on the sea coast and the basis of an exosystem with incalculable biodiversity. Another major focus of the project is to raise collective awareness that the disappearance of Posidonia oceanica forests is not an option, as the absence of these forests leads to a greater presence of CO2.

Finally, in any case, carbon sequestration by artificial techniques to be developed and carbon credits will also be included in the netzero strategy to ensure the achievement of neutrality.

# MODULE B-3 : Indicators for Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning

For better completion of this module, the Comprehensive Indicator Sets developed by NetZeroCities are expected.

In this first version we use the relevant indicators for València. On the one hand, we took a selection of those found in our València 2030 Urban Strategy, and show them in table B.3.0-a and, on the other hand, we selected those relevant to the Green City Accord, which are expressed in table B-3.0-b and which consider more of the environmental aspects.

Both selections are taken as a first approximation of this monitoring exercise.

In future iterations we will cross-reference the Comprehensive Indicator Sets to be developed by NetZeroCities with the indicators defined in our València 2030 Urban Strategy and with those relevant to the Green City Accord. For the time being, those previously described in this first approach to the Climate City Contract (CCC) follow.

# PART C - ENABLING CLIMATE NEUTRALITY BY 2030

This module aims to outline any enabling interventions - i.e. in relation to organisational environment or governance models, or social innovations - designed to support and implement the climate action portfolios described in module B-2, as well as to achieve the co-benefits described in the impact pathway (module B-1).

# MODULE C-1 : Organisational and Governance Innovation Interventions

The complexity of the challenge of achieving climate neutrality by 2030 requires, first and foremost, that Public Administrations significantly change the way we organise ourselves internally, while at the same time generating new governance models both internally and externally. The innovative organisational and governance interventions presented below are a compendium of actions currently underway in the City Council, all of them following the logic of multi-stakeholder collaboration, distributed leadership and multilevel governance, and always with the objective of overcoming the barriers identified to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

On the other hand, it is necessary to highlight the effort we are making to direct most of the public instruments for promoting innovation towards our Climate Mission València 2030.

## C-1.2: Description of organisational and governance interventions

### València 2030 Urban Strategy

The València Urban Strategy 2030 includes the Climate Mission in its basis and core design and ensures:

The transversal governance of the mission from the City Council, breaking down internal silos and creating spaces for decision-making, communication and operational management for the development of the mission.
Multi-level governance at local, regional and national levels by seeking partnerships and breaking down external silos with different levels of government.
Public policies deployed in the decade to 2030 are guided by the climate mission.
The merger between the 2030 Agenda and the European Cities Mission.

### Mission Day by Mission Team

Application of LEAN techniques for the operational management of cross-cutting, multi-stakeholder projects that should design, develop and facilitate the systemic approach and portfolio of actions in the city to accelerate decarbonisation within a context of systemic innovation.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 16: Climate Transition Map from NetZeroCities

Mission Day is held on a regular basis every Friday from 9:00 to 14:00.

### Mission-driven Public Procurement of Innovation

Public demand triggers the development of new innovative products and services that have an impact on the climate mission and solve public needs that are not yet efficiently addressed by the market. 3% of annual investments will be earmarked through this programme with a commitment of €12 million over the next 4 years.

### Mission Driven Innovation Public Grant
AJUNTAMENT DE VALENCIA
Missions València 2030
Climate Action Plan (CAP)
citiES 2030

The Public Innovation Grants instrument is redirected towards the climate mission by offering financial support to innovation projects from the ecosystem with an impact on the mission. The selection criteria for the projects to be subsidised are:

Potential impact on the mission
Private investment complementing the public investment provided through the grant
Capacity for social involvement and mobilisation of the ecosystem in the direction of the mission.

## València Urban Sandbox Regulatory Bylaw

An ordinance has been designed to regulate the València Urban Sandbox, currently in the process of public consultation, which:

Develops a new Administrative Procedure within the functioning of the City Council that aims to provide greater flexibility and simplification for the processing of applications for access to the Urban Sandbox.
Regulates the application procedure, eligibility conditions, access and testing of innovation projects.
Focuses on the Quintuple Helix Model and prioritises entities adhering to the Mission Alliance.
Contemplates a subjective scope of application that includes both the València City Council itself and its local public sector.
Designs a new concept: Urban Sandbox Resource, as those spaces, infrastructures and/or events in the city of València that will serve as a testing ground in relevant or real environments for the testing of innovation projects.

## Mission's Public-Private Investment Fund

València creates the public-private investment fund instrument for the Climate Mission as a public accelerator of València for the selection and accompaniment of Startups with an impact on the Climate Mission and the subsequent financing through a public-private fund of those with the greatest potential for triple impact: economic, social and environmental.

## València Govtech

Govtech Laboratory of València in a context of collaboration and open innovation where Govtech solutions are developed to improve public services and boost the digital infrastructure of the City Council with intensive application of Digital Enabling Technologies in a context of Industrial Revolution 4.0.

# MODULE C-2 : Social and other innovation interventions

Beyond existing instruments and spaces for deliberation and social co-creation such as the Social Council of the City or the Urban Forum, it is necessary to involve the entire innovation and economic development ecosystem of the city of València within a broad strategy of inclusion and participation of all key entities to achieve the goal of climate neutrality in the city. With this objective in mind, and with the The Mission Alliance as an umbrella that brings together the rest of the elements, we want to make a collective call to action that, under the logic of open innovation, allows us to build specific joint workspaces with:

Citizens, for which it is proposed to set up a Climate Assembly, in which citizens themselves will be the driving force for change and the necessary transformations at neighbourhood level, but also at city level, in order to achieve climate neutrality. It will join the Urban Forum in which we will review our Climate City Contract (CCC) with citizens every two years. In addition, we want citizens to be active agents in the development of projects with an impact on the climate mission and, to this end, we have set up the Ciuta-lab, a citizen laboratory oriented towards the climate mission.

The innovative productive ecosystem, for whom, in addition to making available a whole range of public instruments to promote innovation aimed at the València 2030 Climate Mission (see table C.1.1: Organisational and governance interventions), we are activating Colab-lab, as our public accelerator for start-ups and innovative business initiatives with a triple impact: social, economic and environmental.

And finally, the Academy, for which we intend to strengthen our collaboration with the city's two public universities, shaping a long-term working space that, pivoting on the Climate Neutral UPV project, will generate new capacities, knowledge and spaces for collaboration under the so-called University-City binomial.

## C-2.2: Description of social and other innovation actions

### Mission Alliance
A set of networks, programmes and actions that generate collaboration for the development of the city strategy and its climate mission among the 5 helixes of the ecosystem. As an impact, the Missions València Constellation is created, which aggregates hundreds of research and innovation projects from the innovation ecosystem of València and oriented towards the climate mission, achieving in parallel the attraction of investment in innovation to the city, generating employment associated with innovation and projecting the innovative value of Valèncian companies and organisations.

### Urban Forum
A space that brings together the entire social, economic, institutional and cultural fabric of the city, to reflect in a shared way on the future sustainable development of our city and our environment. The Urban Forum proposes different open days for citizens (in the form of thematic conferences, debate spaces, workshops and exhibitions,

1
AJUNTAMENT DE VALENCIA
Missions València 2030
Climate Action Plan (CAP)
citiES 2030

among others) to involve all the city's agents, including the citizens themselves, in this journey towards the València we imagine.

## Climate Assembly

Understood as a mechanism and deliberative process among the citizens of València, chosen at random while maintaining social and territorial representativeness, to debate the climate emergency situation in the city and make recommendations to improve it.

## Ciuta-lab

Our Ciuta-Lab can be described as a citizen laboratory oriented towards the València 2030 Climate Mission. It aims to be, therefore, a space for research and innovation; a place in which to learn to participate, to experiment and to jointly produce solutions to the climate challenge we face as a city, bringing together, for this purpose, diverse people from a logic of citizen co-design of the city under four core values: collaboration, experimentation, openness and care. Ciuta-lab aims with this space to bring together diverse actors from our five helixes of innovation from a citizen logic, to collectively think about the challenges facing the city oriented to the València 2030 Climate Mission and collaboratively seek innovative solutions to address them.

## Col-lab

Triple impact (social, economic and environmental) public accelerator for social and urban innovation startups. It is part of the tools of the Missions València 2030 initiative.

## City-University Binomials

Development of the new instrument at the service of the climate mission to put the research of our universities at the service of the climate mission. It is being developed with the city's two major public universities:

The Polytechnic University of València
The University of València

The aim is to incorporate the vector of science, research and innovation as a key element to develop the city's transformation process.

The aim of the Binomio is to establish a space for dialogue and collaboration between the university and the city to contribute fundamental elements to move towards climate neutrality in multiple ways:

Providing knowledge and specific research on key issues for the city model.
Developing a way and methodology of working oriented towards experimentation, innovation and planning-action-learning.
Providing a key educational space, as the professionals of the future will necessarily work in a context of transition to sustainability, which will require specific knowledge and skills.
Providing university campuses, as part of the physical space of the city, so that they can become reference spaces for action and models for innovation and climate neutrality.
Articulating new forms of dialogue and collaboration between diverse actors.

## Social Communication

One aspect in which València demonstrates leadership and a different approach in the field of social innovation actions aimed at missions is the way it deals with social communication. Not only it has created a dedicated website, using the analogy of the mission to the moon (Missions Valencia 2030 - Missions València 2030 : Missions València 2030), but a whole universe has been developed around it with its brand, messages and graphic image. As its claim says, "One whole city, one single purpose" with its hashtag #OnAMissionTogether. In order to attract the whole city to this ambitious goal, the complexity of the project has to be communicated in the simplest and most friendly way possible, so that it can be understood by anyone, of all ages and from all walks of life. In this sense, we have chosen to use a casual and very creative imagery, as is the Mediterranean society. Images, infographics, dynamic and casual videos, which capture the attention immediately and invite you to take part in the project. It is emphasised that this is a project by and for the citizens, in fact, "by and for you".

The form is questioning and personal, but the communicative content should also be emphasised. The choice is to focus efforts on communicating how the Mission is beneficial for citizens, benefits that are personalised as much as

2
AJUNTAMENT DE VALENCIA
Missions València 2030
Climate Action Plan (CAP)
citiES 2030

possible, as indicated above. This is done through practical examples for citizens, in particular, for you. These co-benefits are expressed in a down-to-earth and very light-hearted way.

Here you can find the first communication campaign around the first Missions València 2030 framework : https://www.missionsvalencia.eu/valencia-lanca-la-primera-campanya-de-comunicacio-a-la-ciutadania-sobre-la-missio-climatica-valencia-2030/?lang=en

Thus, it speaks of co-benefits in simple terms, "for more gardens, for better food"; "for less traffic jams, for cleaner air", and plays with the prepositions "by and for" that resonate with the overall motto of the mission, "by and for citizenship".

In addition, a set of tools, a toolkit has been prepared by Las Naves, a municipal foundation that describes itself as a "Centre for Social and Urban Innovation", to make the brand available and allow anyone who wants to use it to do so. You can find the material here: +Info - Missions València 2030 : Missions València 2030 (missionsvalencia.eu)

As explained above, València had oriented its innovation towards missions in parallel to the foundations of the European Mission of Cities being laid. Therefore, there is a first framework of Missions that derive from the city visions. When València joins the EU Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, it is decided to create a new brand, which is compatible and coexists with the previous one: it is called València 2030 Climate Mission. This new identity allows the integration of the two European missions in which the city is immersed, Cities and Adaptation, under the umbrella of climate. In addition, it is associated with a new communication campaign, whose illustrations have been designed by a Valencian artist, Diego Mir, and which has been very well received due to its proximity, etc.

The new image of Misión Climática València 2030 can be found here: Campaña nueva imagen Misión Climática València 2030 (lasnaves.com)

The new brand of the Climate Mission València 2030 has been created to give the mission its own logo and graphic universe. The new brand is a living, flexible and moving logo. This helps us to adapt to different situations and needs. It is intended to work in any format and occasion, although vibrant and friendly colours have been chosen, it can be used in white on a coloured background.

Diego Mir's designs and illustrations help us to tell the public about the benefits of the Climate Mission, as well as supporting messages in the dissemination of events. The designs, which are the conjunction of human element plus sustainable element, represent the citizens of Valencia illustrating its diversity. The new brand has been communicated through various graphic and audiovisual pieces on the city's street furniture, press, social networks and digital media.

All of this is summarised in its claim "One whole city. One single purpose", which speaks of the essence of the Climate Mission, a mission that leaves no one behind but is possible thanks to the entire innovation ecosystem. Innovation in Valencia is joint and with the same purpose, to make the city carbon neutral and become the prosperous, Mediterranean, creative, sustainable, healthy and enterprising city we dream of.

With this, as it is intended in the EU Mission, we intend to "mobilise the knowledge, imagination, affections and values of citizens to improve the quality of policymaking", this way capitalizing on the unique position of cities as the level of government closest to citizens, as challenge and opportunity hubs where 'policy meets people'. By engaging them in this process, they can take an active role to drive the transition to climate neutrality as co-designers, co-implementers and co-beneficiaries and this is exactly the aim of this communication strategy and its campaigns.

# MODULE C-3 : Financing of Action Portfolio (Economic Case)

To provide the basis for the Climate Investment Plan (CIP), the impact and incremental costs obtained from the economic modelling for the selected ambitions in each sub-sector represented are broken down here.

For each sector and sub-sector represented in the model, the city of València has projected its ambitions for 2030 to reach neutrality, i.e. to reach the 84% reduction in emissions with respect to BAU2030, the result explained above.

With these ambitions described in the table below, table C-3-1 (Sub-sector Ambitions - Assumptions 2030 column), the model used in the analysis estimates the potential impact as well as the potential incremental cost of each strategy and action.

The impact includes GHG reduction data (kt CO2e), operational cost savings data (MEUR - NPV 2020-2050) and co-benefits (MEUR - NPV 2020-2050). Net Present Value (NPV) values have been used because this is the basis for calculating the return on investment (ROI). Furthermore, the same time horizon is used.

Indeed, the impact, particularly in the case of co-benefits, is calculated with a time horizon of 2020-2050, which is why operational savings are also included in this horizon. All this is done by bringing the monetised values to the present. Cash values are defined and shown in the tables in Annex II, Climate Investment Plan (CIP), in particular tables B-1-1.a and B-1.1.b, which are important for budgeting and assessing capital needs.

By considering the potential ROI of different decarbonisation strategies and actions, the Economic Model can help cities identify the most cost-effective ways to achieve their emission reduction targets by ensuring that limited resources are allocated to strategies and actions that provide maximum value for the city and its residents.

The economic model used allows a first economic assessment of some of the co-benefits qualitatively identified in the table above, by sub-sector (table B - Impact Pathways) for the sectors represented in this one, to obtain the Return on Investment and the economic case for neutrality.

This information is essential to motivate ecosystem involvement while building loyalty and participation in climate action.

It is planned to include more precision and documented quantification of these co-benefits in future iterations of the model and the Climate City Contract (CCC). At present and with the present model used, documentary information has been obtained to monetise the impact of the following co-benefits, broken down by sector:

Finally, the first analysis of the economic case for València shows that the initial investment is high, but that the co-benefits to 2050 and accumulated savings over time are such that an estimated return on investment (ROI) of more than 85% is reached, considering direct and indirect costs. It should be noted here that the ROI considered is that established by the case study provided by the model, a case study with 4 main sectors and 13 sub-sectors on which to act, and that it does not consider some structural and transversal costs, which are considered in the Urban Strategy. It will be necessary to consider and include in future iterations of the contract, the other sectors of importance in the case of València, and those transversal and structural costs necessary for its future calculation.

As an additional comment, it should be noted that the ambition to reduce the need for motorised transport highlighted here is fully aligned with the national government's plans in the PNIEC and the RD of Low Emission Zones where it is stated that the main driving force behind the "decarbonisation" of the mobility-transport sector will be a modal shift that will affect the 35% of passenger-kilometres that are nowadays carried out in conventional combustion vehicles.

The measure that presumes the implementation of Low Emission Zones, for municipalities of 50,000 inhabitants, as in the case of València, in order to reduce the use of private vehicles. According to the PNIEC, it is considered feasible to reduce passenger traffic (passenger-km) in urban environments by 35% until 2030 and interurban traffic by 1.5% per year. Teleworking, car sharing, the use of non-motorised means and collective public transport will make it possible to meet these objectives, and it is of great importance to enable adequate funding for public transport to improve quality and service, attract more users and, in this way, contribute to improving air quality in urban environments. In short, the PNIEC is committed to modal shift, traffic reduction, the use of collective public transport, sustainable mobility and electrification in terms of energy consumption in the transport sector, and València has projected its ambitions for 2030 in this subsector of reducing motorised mobility, fully in line with these national strategies and estimates.

After the signing of the first City of València Climate City Contract (CCC) foreseen in Level 1 of the engagement process, awareness-raising, social communication and engagement actions on the City of València Climate City Contract (CCC) will be deployed to achieve new accessions to it from the city's ecosystem and which will serve to accelerate the learning and impacts of the transition towards climate neutrality.

The following figure represents the detail of the 3 levels of the process of engagement with the Climate City Contract (CCC) of the City of València, of which we highlight:

As in Level 1, the València Climate City Contract (CCC) involves the acceleration of action to achieve the desired City Model defined by the València 2030 Urban Strategy and its successive reviews and improvements through the biennial Urban Forum.
As in Level 2, the members of the Mission Transition RoundTable serve as the first demonstrators and examples of the adherence of the 5 helices of the ecosystem to the cyclical and continuous process of reviewing and signing the City of València Climate City Contract (CCC).
As in Level 3, we focus the process of seeking new members within the The Mission Alliance by adjusting the commitments by business cluster, economic sector or social sphere of life in València (small and medium-sized businesses, schools, families, cultural and festive associations, etc.).
