An abstract summarizes the content of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan (CCC Action Plan) that is developed jointly by local authorities, local businesses, and other stakeholders.

# Textual element

Ljubljana, the vibrant capital of Slovenia, has embarked on an ambitious journey to become a pioneer in climate policy not only regionally, but across Europe. This commitment is testament to the city's dedication to sustainable development and reflects a deep-rooted awareness of environmental responsibility and a proactive approach to tackling global climate challenges.

Ljubljana was recognised as the European Green Capital 2016 for its remarkable progress in improving the quality of urban life and its visionary approach to environmental protection. This honour, awarded by the European Commission, puts Ljubljana at the forefront of European cities actively tackling climate change. The city's involvement in climate policy is an essential aspect of its identity and demonstrates its commitment to sustainable practices and innovative solutions.

Achieving climate neutrality by 2030 is an ambitious goal that requires a multi-faceted approach. The city itself plays a central role by taking the lead through strategic planning, policy implementation and the promotion of a culture of sustainability. The city's transition team, including the city administration and public enterprises and institutions, is an integral part of achieving the climate goals and contributes significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The citizens of Ljubljana are also important actors on this journey. Their involvement in sustainable practices, be it by using public transport, supporting local green initiatives, or adopting energy-efficient habits, is essential to the success of the city's climate goals.

Ljubljana faces several challenges in its pursuit of climate neutrality, which it addresses in the 2030 City Neutral Climate Action Plan as areas in which it has no or only partial implementation competence and can therefore only implement in multi-level governance and deep stakeholder and citizen engagement. In drawing up the CCC with the entire urban community, Ljubljana is building on existing plans and strategies and systematically developing them further based on scientific data, as has already been recognised as an A List city by CDP/ICLEI. The design of the Action Portfolio was based on the interlinking of different actions with consideration of the Levers of Change.

To achieve climate neutrality in 2030, annual emissions must be reduced by 80% compared to the estimated 2018 figure to reach 460,316 tonnes of CO₂e emissions in 2030. The main measures to achieve this target are the energy renovation of the building stock, phasing out the use of fossil fuels in the DHS and the natural gas network, electrification of road transport (cars and lorries), increasing the production of renewable energy (biogas, hydrogen) and reducing residual emissions (CCU technologies, conservation of carbon sinks). The action plan consists of 5 main fields of action (energy systems, mobility &amp; transport, waste &amp; circular economy, green infrastructure &amp; nature-based solutions, and built environment) and 2 additional (digitalization, engaging and collaborating with stakeholders) that are related to the main fields of action. The list of measures together comprises 118 individual measures.

At a regional and national level, Ljubljana's efforts are supported by policies and initiatives that promote environmental sustainability. The Slovenian government's commitment to the European Green Deal and its own national climate targets provides a supportive framework for Ljubljana's ambitions. In addition, the European Union's policies and funding opportunities support the city's ability to effectively implement its climate action plans. The high political willingness and ambition to achieve climate neutrality is reflected in Ljubljana's proactive measures defined in the 2030 City Neutral Climate Action Plan.

# 1 Introduction

The introduction outlines the local geographic and policy context in which the city's 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan is being developed and describes the gap it addresses in broad terms.

## Introduction

### THE OVERALL 2030 CLIMATE NEUTRALITY ACTION PLANNING STRATEGY AND FRAMEWORKS

The City of Ljubljana's decision to join the Climate City Contract (CCC) is an important milestone in its long-standing commitment to environmental sustainability. This step is a natural consequence of being recognised as the "Green Capital" in 2016, which acknowledged Ljubljana's achievements to date in the field of sustainable development and set the course for future efforts. The city's involvement in the CCC is not only a continuation of its journey towards sustainability, but a strategic step that aligns its historic efforts with its ambitious 2030 goals. By combining its experiences and lessons learnt from the past with its aspirations for a climate-neutral future, Ljubljana is strengthening its role as a pioneer in creating a greener, safer, and more inclusive urban environment. The CCC offers Ljubljana the opportunity to collaborate, share knowledge and build partnerships to strengthen its reputation on the international stage as a city committed to improving the quality of life of its inhabitants while tackling the urgent challenges of climate change. This initiative emphasises Ljubljana's holistic approach to sustainability and demonstrates the city's unwavering commitment to environmental excellence and creating a sustainable path for future generations.

Ljubljana's strategic alignment with the Climate City Contract (CCC) demonstrates that the city's journey towards sustainability and carbon neutrality is deeply rooted in its development vision. In 2007, Ljubljana adopted the forward-looking Vision Ljubljana 2025, laying the foundations for a sustainable future. This vision, which the city is still actively realising today, is anchored in the fundamental task of improving the quality of life for citizens and visitors. Even then, Ljubljana had set itself the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral city by 2050 - not only an ambitious goal, but also a clear sign of the city's commitment to the environment. The vision set out 93 specific development projects that have already been realised or are currently being implemented. The inspiration and guidance gained from the Green Capital award and the strategic foresight of the city's Vision 2025 have significantly improved the living standards of the city's population. In addition, the city has implemented more than 2,400 other projects to improve the quality of life.

To tackle new challenges and raise its ambitions, Ljubljana has introduced Vision Ljubljana 2045 and set itself the ambitious goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040. The development guidelines set out in Vision 2045 focus on resilience, innovation and improving the city's visibility and reputation. These guidelines are not only ambitious but are embedded in the city's spatial planning and sectoral strategies. This visionary document also underlines the city's proactive stance in promoting cooperation between citizens, businesses, universities, research institutions, non-governmental organisations, neighbouring municipalities, and other stakeholders to achieve the set goals.

The City of Ljubljana's commitment to the Climate City Contract (CCC) is a strategic step that coherently embodies its commitment to sustainability and resilience. This focus includes an additional range of initiatives to introduce renewable energy and energy efficiency, promote sustainable transport, enhance urban green spaces, apply circular economy principles, actively engage stakeholders, etc., demonstrating the city's increased commitment to environmental protection.

Ljubljana's current climate planning is strengthened by plans and strategies that form a coherent mosaic on the road to sustainability.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

These include the Local Energy Concept - LEC and the Sustainable Energy Climate Action Plan - SECAP (2022-2030) - the only action plans in the areas of energy efficiency, renewable energy, mobility with assessed emissions and climate risk vulnerability assessment, the Programme for Protection against Natural and Other Disasters (2023-2030), the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan - SUMP (2022-2027), Ljubljana's Strategy for Circular Potentials (2021-2027), the Urban Digital Platform, the Environmental Action Programme, the Urban Forest Development Strategy and the Rural Development and Urban Agriculture Strategy (2021-2027). This tandem work between CCC and the city's existing climate measures and initiatives related to  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  emissions is further visualised, see Figure 1.

The development trajectory of the city's key strategies from 2007 to 2024 shows the commitment to reducing emissions, as evidenced by the  $20\%$  reduction in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  emissions in 2020 from a 2008 baseline (highlighted in blue) and the planned  $80\%$  reduction in  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  emissions by 2030 from a 2018 baseline (highlighted in orange). It is important to note that the adoption of these strategies is not directly correlated with the emissions data unless explicitly stated (in blue and orange).

This holistic approach shows the compatibility and synergies between the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan and the current efforts or programmes that the city is already implementing. Ljubljana's determination not only to set ambitious climate targets, but also to effectively integrate and execute multiple strategies to achieve them.

Figure 1: Ljubljana's current climate planning.

The Figure represents the development path of key city's strategies between 2007-2024. The emissions (highlighted on the left with blue colour) include  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  emissions in 2008 and their reduction in 2020 (20%). The emissions (highlighted on the left with orange colour) include  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  emissions in 2018 and planned  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$  emissions reduction till 2030 (80%). Adoption of strategies is not directly related to the shown emissions, except where emissions are highlighted (blue and orange colour).

To ensure that the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan is aligned with the city's formal and established procedures and frameworks for climate action, the city used the CCC as a strategic tool for a comprehensive review and integration of its various strategies and programmes.

This process involved a detailed, cross-sectoral analysis of all existing and relevant plans with a strong focus on their synergistic potential to advance the city's overarching goal of climate neutrality while promoting resilience and sustainability.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Key to this approach was the assessment and integration of measures from existing strategies, e.g. SUMP, LEC, etc. rather than a blanket adoption of these programmes, the CCC strategically integrated elements that contribute significantly to the city's ambitious climate neutrality targets, while also considering other indirect yet impactful aspects.

During the preparation of the CCC, the additional measures in the individual sectors were discussed in depth with stakeholders from various perspectives. The city prides itself on its collaborative approach to strategy development, involving a wide range of stakeholders, as the city has a long history of best practice. Considerations such as accountability, funding sources and feasibility, direct and indirect, social, environmental, and organisational aspects have been carefully considered for each measure.

The methodology fosters a sense of shared responsibility and commitment among stakeholders. This inclusive process ensures that all voices are heard and that the resulting strategies reflect a comprehensive and shared vision for the future of Ljubljana. This forward-looking approach ensures that these new measures are seamlessly integrated into future revisions of Ljubljana's strategies and programmes and are continuously enriched with new and innovative measures that are in line with the city's goals. Furthermore, this ensures that the CCC is not just a static framework, but a dynamic, evolving, relevant and effective plan that responds to evolving needs and opportunities. Furthermore, it provides both the mandate and the framework for action.

The Climate City Contract (CCC) commitments, together with the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan and the 2030 Climate Neutrality Investment Plan, will form a comprehensive policy framework. This framework will further on guide the city's administration, public organisations, and institutions to include principles of climate neutrality into all decision-making processes. In areas as environment, energy, circular economy, waste management and climate change, Ljubljana has consistently pursued a harmonised policy, prior to CCC. This coherent approach ensures that all these sectors work in line with the common goal of sustainability.

The CCC will play a central role in Ljubljana's long-term strategic planning. It will play an important role in revising existing strategies, especially in areas where the CCC has identified measures that are currently not included in the current strategies. The CCC will also play a crucial role in setting and monitoring indicators and understanding the linkages between different sectors. This holistic view is important to ensure that all city measures are aligned and contribute effectively to the overall goal of climate neutrality.

Ljubljana's commitment to the CCC is a comprehensive and forward-looking approach that integrates climate protection into the structure of the city's administrative and operational structures. This commitment not only reflects Ljubljana's climate endeavours, but also creates a solid framework for sustainable climate neutral urban development now and in the future.

Achieving the set goals will require significant financial resources, as further detailed in the city's Investment plan. Therefore, a key focus is on creating a strong, structured framework at various levels to support financing and gain the support of politicians and decision-makers.

The development of Ljubljana's CCC has been carefully aligned with the Net Zero Cities (NZC) Climate Transitional Map to ensure a coherent and strategic approach to climate action.

# BUILD A STRONG MANDATE

In Ljubljana, the commitment to climate neutrality by 2030 is a top priority, supported by the city leadership and deeply embedded in the organisational structure. Led by the mayor and supported by six deputy mayors, each responsible for specific areas (one specifically for environmental protection, climate change and spatial planning), the City of Ljubljana uses a broad-based committee approach to decision-making. This co-operative structure ensures comprehensive planning and implementation of strategies that are formally adopted by the City Council.

The Ljubljana city family, united under the umbrella of Public Holding Ljubljana, consists of employees from the administration, public companies, and institutions. This holding connects important public services such as energy, waste and wastewater treatment and public transport, thus ensuring seamless service provision.

The city has legal authority in critical areas such as construction, waste management, water resources, public health, energy management, urban land use and green infrastructure, and underpins its efforts with a strong legislative focus.

Responsibility for the Climate City contract has been assigned to the head of the city's Environmental Protection Department. This person is accountable to the Deputy Mayor and oversees the various aspects and initiatives of the CCC. This streamlined organisational structure promotes effective collaboration and the integration of content essential to climate action.

In early 2023, the mayor appointed a project manager for the city's climate initiatives and established a Core City Team (CCT) made up of the heads of the various public administration departments. This strategic step, combined with the formation of the City Transitional Team (CTT), which is made up of 23 representatives from the public administration and public city companies and organisations, illustrates Ljubljana's integrative approach to climate neutrality. The composition of the CTT reflects a holistic strategy that incorporates different perspectives and expertise.

In addition, Ljubljana invited various stakeholders, including experts and non-governmental organisations, to form the stakeholder group (ISG) in order to broaden the range of contributions to the city's climate strategy. Building on this, the Local Transition Team (LTT) was established, comprising specialised focus teams (SFT) for seven key areas. These teams play a central role in

steering Ljubljana's efforts towards a sustainable future and ensuring alignment with the city's ambitious climate goals.

In addition, the newly formed Ljubljana City Climate Change Council (a mix of CTT, ISG and SFT representatives) will be formed to advise the city on planning and implementing measures and closely monitor the impact of the implementation of the Action and Investment Plan.

## UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM

In 2018 (base year), most GHG emissions in the city of Ljubljana were caused by energy consumption in buildings, which accounted for 61.8% of total emissions in the city. Transport in the city of Ljubljana is responsible for 34.4% of total GHG emissions, while waste management and wastewater treatment contribute 2.1%. The agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) sector accounts for a smaller share of 1.0% and the industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector for 0.6%.

Ljubljana's approach to understanding and managing its systems is both comprehensive and data driven. The city's robust monitoring tradition is illustrated by the launch of the Energy Climate Atlas in 2018. This innovative software tool contains a wealth of spatial, climate and environmental data and provides automatic updates and reports for decision making. This tool not only improves the city's ability to respond quickly to environmental challenges, but also supports strategic planning and policy development.

In addition to the Energy-Climate Atlas, Ljubljana has been meticulously compiling its annual Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Inventory since 2013. This important document is prepared in accordance with the OECD/IEA methodology. This practice emphasises Ljubljana's commitment to maintaining a clear, comprehensive, and accurate understanding of its energy consumption and related emissions.

In addition, Ljubljana has been continuously reporting to CDP/ICLEI since 2017 and achieved an impressive A- score in 2021. This CDP reporting is a testament to the city's transparent and progressive approach to achieving climate neutrality. It reflects Ljubljana's commitment to not only setting ambitious targets, but also methodically tracking and reporting on its progress. The city places great importance on collecting and analysing the necessary data annually so that it can effectively adapt and refine its strategies.

Through these measures, Ljubljana ensures that its climate strategies are based on a deep and evolving understanding of its systems. This systematic approach is crucial for the city to tackle the complex challenges of climate change and continue its journey towards sustainability and climate resilience.

## BACKGROUND CITY INFORMATION

In 2022, the city of Ljubljana had 293,845 inhabitants, with a population density of 1,068.5 inhabitants/km². The main settlement, Ljubljana, has a majority of 284,293 inhabitants. The administrative area covered by the climate neutrality targets for 2030 includes the entire administrative area of the city of Ljubljana (larger urban area). The entire administrative area of the City of Ljubljana is 275 km², with the urban settlement of Ljubljana covering 164 km². In terms of land use within the city, forests predominate with 41% of the area, followed by built-up areas with 25%, permanent grassland with 13% and arable land with 10%.

The city has a temperate continental climate (warm summers and moderately cold winters). Urbanisation and global warming have caused the average annual temperature to rise from 11.4°C (1991-2020) to 12.2°C (2013-2022). There are up to 120 foggy days a year in the city. The monthly precipitation peaks occur in autumn and summer, with pronounced summer peaks in most areas. Natural hazards (floods, landslides, drought) are influenced by deviations from the long-term average values, with extreme precipitation events exceeding the average values by 200 to 400%. Snow cover

has decreased in recent decades and amounts to around 50 days per year in the city. The sunshine duration is between 1,890 and 2,000 hours per year.

Ljubljana is the largest employment centre in Slovenia. In addition to the inhabitants of Ljubljana, around 130,000 people from the surrounding municipalities and other regions commute to work or school in Ljubljana every day.

The city is part of the pan-European transport network with ten corridors, including Corridor V and Corridor X. As these are corridors, a significant part of the traffic is transit traffic. The location of the city of Ljubljana at the intersection of the two corridors contributes to its favourable traffic situation.

The city of Ljubljana is characterised by a high concentration of secondary schools, universities, and institutes, which makes it the largest educational centre in Slovenia. The City of Ljubljana is the founder of the Ljubljana Health Centre, the largest public primary health care facility in Slovenia. The City of Ljubljana is the founder of the Ljubljana Public Pharmacy (Lekarna Ljubljana), the largest pharmacy centre in Slovenia.

## STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT

Ljubljana attaches great importance to involving all relevant stakeholders in the process, from planning to implementation. In January 2023, the city developed the CCC Participatory-Communication Strategy (CCC-PCS), the strategy for participatory communication of the CCC. This strategy, which aims to promote a structured, transparent, and inclusive process, is based on a variety of initiatives, events, and activities. It reflects a broad range of perspectives, needs, and interests and focuses on key areas that are critical to the transformation of the city (more in sections A-3.3 and C-1.1 of the Action Plan).

A stakeholder analysis was carried out to assess the critical stakeholders. Stakeholders were categorised into four groups based on the importance and power dynamics of each stakeholder group and their level of interest.

Critical stakeholders were identified as those whose involvement, influence and interests are crucial to the success and impact of a project or policy, whether as an individual organisation or as a group: European Union and Slovenian government authorities, municipal, state, or private companies and industry leaders, academia and research, citizens, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and environmental associations as watchdogs holding stakeholders accountable and advocating for sustainable practices.

The critical stakeholders represent such well-educated groups as: The City Transition Team (CTT), the Interested Stakeholder Group (ISG), the Specialised Focus Teams (SFT), the Ljubljana City Climate Change Council, the City Council. Neighbouring municipalities, international strategic partnerships such as the Euro Cities Network, ICLEI Circular Cities, Ellen MacArthur Foundation's CE100, Zero Waste Network (Detailed in Commitments, section 3. Strategic priorities).

## CLIMATE NEUTRALITY TARGET AND AMBITION

The analysis of baseline GHG emissions and reduction targets refers to the entire administrative territory of the City of Ljubljana (larger urban area), and no parts of the sectors, territories, sources, and gases were excluded.

As proposed in the Mission Info Kit for Cities, emissions from industrial facilities within the city boundaries that are registered under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) were excluded from the GHG emissions inventory.

Solid waste generated in the city of Ljubljana is disposed of in a landfill within the city limits. Therefore, there are no emissions from waste that is generated within the city limits but disposed of in landfills outside the city limits (Scope 3). On the contrary, waste from other (mostly neighbouring) municipalities is also disposed of at the landfill site within the city. Therefore, methane emissions from

waste from other municipalities deposited at the landfill within the city limits are excluded from the regulation.

The City of Ljubljana used the methodology of the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories (GPC), which is based on the IPCC guidelines, to estimate its greenhouse gas emissions. A combination of the GPC methodology and the Covenant of Mayors (CoM) methodology was used to calculate the local emission factor for grid-supplied electricity, as recommended in the Mission's Info Kit for Cities.

In 2018, Ljubljana emitted 2,301,669 tonnes of CO₂e. As some GHG sources cannot be fully reduced by 2030 due to constraints, the mission proposes (in the Info Kit for Cities V2.0 and in the CCC AP template) to target "residual emissions" within 20% of this baseline and to provide offsets for hard-to-reduce sources. Ljubljana plans to reduce emissions by 80%, i.e. by a total of 1,841,353 tonnes of CO₂e, with residual emissions of 460,316 tonnes (20%).

The most important measures for achieving this target are the energy-efficient refurbishment of the building stock, the gradual phasing out of fossil fuels in the DHS and the natural gas network, the electrification of road transport (cars and lorries), the increase in the production of renewable energies (biogas, hydrogen) and the reduction of residual emissions (CCU technologies, conservation of carbon sinks). The highlighted measures are also measures with a higher financial outlay, which is recognised in the urban investment plan.

Regarding "residual emissions", the city will focus on CCU technologies (no suitable geology for CCS). The main energy plant, fuelled by biogas and biomass, is expected to sequester significant amounts of CO₂, resulting in negative emissions. A new waste co-incineration plant will also use carbon capture to neutralise all emissions. It is expected to capture 394,616 tonnes of CO₂ annually, with the captured CO₂ to be reused in local industry. The city's carbon sinks, including forests and urban green spaces, contributed 49,900 tonnes in 2018, with a target of 65,700 tonnes of CO₂. The planned measures will strengthen these natural sinks and promote the sustainable management of urban areas.

## PLAN EVOLUTION SUMMARY

The 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan includes a portfolio of measures across all sectors and mandatory indicators based on the identification of gaps within the sector to achieve GHG emission neutrality from a technological/infrastructural, institutional/regulatory, organisational, financial, political, social, and behavioural perspective. The 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan thus ensures comprehensive and cross-sectoral impact pathways by engaging stakeholders at multiple levels of governance.

For future iterations, the cities plan to refine these areas by expanding the range of indicators used for monitoring and reporting.

This includes not only greenhouse gas emissions data, but also additional indicators for co-benefits such as biodiversity, economy, environment/public health, resource efficiency and social inclusion. The aim is to create a more streamlined and interconnected data management and reporting system to increase the effectiveness of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan.

These evolving aspects of the 2030 Climate Neutrality Action Plan reflect a dynamic approach that adapts to new data, insights, and the evolving needs of the city.

Building on the knowledge and experience gained during the preparation of the CCC and building on past successful practices, the focus will be on maintaining momentum, creating even more robust frameworks, gaining the support of policy makers, and strengthening stakeholder teams that demonstrate exemplary commitment.

The City Transition Team (CTT) will be responsible for producing an annual report detailing the progress made in implementing the CCC. A key element will be the establishment of a Climate Change Council in the City of Ljubljana (a mix of representatives from the CTT, ISG and SFT), which will advise on the planning and implementation of measures and closely monitor impacts, playing an important advisory role. The report will also be assessed annually by the City Council, enabling informed decision making and annual strategic adjustments to the plan.

Transparency and public accountability are also important components of the plan. By making the annual report publicly available, supported by the Info Point on climate change (one stop shop) and numerous other social innovations, Ljubljana will foster an environment of openness that encourages wider community engagement and support for its climate initiatives (see C section).

From 2024, an updated CCC will be uploaded to 100 CNSC Mission Platform every two years. An update will also include a report on the status and progress of the measures implemented in the organisations that have committed to the CCC (signatories to the CCC) in the areas they have identified or implemented that address the climate neutrality targets. This approach enables the evaluation of signatories' effectiveness and commitment, informs investment, and encourages further progress and improvements in the CCC processes (see signatories of the city's climate neutral commitment).

# METHODOLOGY USED

A detailed inventory of energy consumption and GHG emissions by sectors for the City of Ljubljana was initially established for the base year 2018, and it has been updated annually using the same methodology since then, with the inclusion of new and improved data over the years. When better data is acquired at the city level, calculations are also retroactively adjusted for previous years. The most recent data on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions is available for the year 2022.

The primary methodology used for emissions estimation is the GHG Protocol for Cities (GPC), which is derived from the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

Additionally, the emission inventory is also produced in parallel using the methodology outlined in the Covenant of Mayors SECAP Guidebook, which is similar but excludes certain sectors (e.g., emissions reported under the IPPU sector, non-energy related emissions/removals in the AFOLU sector due to changes in carbon stocks, and other emissions in agriculture).
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

However, since the Mission's Info Kit for Cities guidelines specify sectors and emissions that are not covered by the Covenant of Mayors methodology, emissions data for the purposes of this reporting is primarily generated using the GPC/IPCC methodology. Emission factors for grid-supplied electricity and heat consumption are calculated by combining the GPC and CoM methodologies, as suggested in the Mission's Info Kit for Cities guidelines.

Greenhouse gas emissions are expressed in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equivalent (tons $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$). Use of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ makes the emissions of different greenhouse gases comparable to each other and therefore can be summed together. When quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, it's necessary to consider at least three of the seven types of greenhouse gases: $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O}$, $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, F-gases (PFCs, HFCs), $\mathrm{NF}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{SF}_{6}$. The City of Ljubljana is currently calculating $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ emissions, which in addition to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ also include $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, $\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O}$, and HFCs, while other gases will be additionally included when more reliable data will be available.

The greenhouse gas emissions inventory includes direct and indirect emissions from energy use, direct emissions in agriculture (enteric fermentation, manure management, fertilizer application, etc.), emissions from solid waste management, and wastewater management. Some F-gases emissions from air conditioning and refrigeration are also included.

Emissions of refrigerant gases (HFCs), used as substitutes for ODS and included in the IPPU sector, are estimated for mobile air conditioning and transport refrigeration. However, for other uses (e.g., commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration), data is only available at the national level and cannot currently be disaggregated to the level of the City of Ljubljana from existing data sources. Emissions of F-gases, $\mathrm{NF}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{SF}_{6}$ at the national level represent less than $5\%$ of the total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ emissions, so they can be considered as insignificant. Nevertheless, we will include in the inventory those for which data will be available or can be indirectly estimated. Within the City of Ljubljana, there are no industrial facilities that would generate emissions of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and other greenhouse gases from industrial processes such as mineral industry, chemical industry or metal production, so these emissions are not included.

Emissions and sinks resulting from land use and land use changes have also been considered. Calculations and estimates specific to the City of Ljubljana, following the IPCC methodology, have been made by the Slovenian Forestry Institute.

Emissions and removals resulting from land use and land use change were estimated using the stock-change method, utilizing specific local data. In line with best practice guidelines (IPCC, 2006; IPCC, 2019), three approaches can be used to assess land use. The highest level is approach 3, where spatial data is explicit, detailing both the extent and location of changes. For the LULUCF sector, spatial data must cover six main land use categories: forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, and other land. Using approach 3 (IPCC, 2006), we compared land use sample points between 2012-2016 and 2016-2020 to develop land use change matrices. For all land use categories, changes in carbon stocks were assessed in living biomass, deadwood and litter, as well as in mineral and organic soils. Emission factors were determined following IPCC guidelines (2006, 2019), with data mainly sourced for the City of Ljubljana. Timber stock data for forests came from the Slovenian Forestry Institute's permanent plots, while dead wood data were obtained from the national forest inventory database.

IPCC guidelines for assessing greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector include various emission sources or processes that cause emissions. Relevant emissions for the City of Ljubljana include $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ emissions from all cultivated lands, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions associated with liming and urea application on cultivated lands, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ emissions from cultivated organic soils, methane $(\mathrm{CH}_4)$
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

emissions from livestock (enteric fermentation), and  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  and  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  emissions from manure management systems.

For estimating emissions in agriculture, several methodologies can be used. Tier 1 involves the use of default IPCC data, while Tiers 2 and 3 require the use of country-specific data. Methane emissions from livestock were calculated at Tier 2 according to IPCC methodology, while emissions from other animal husbandry (such as horses, pigs, and small ruminants), methane emissions from manure management, as well as direct and indirect nitrous oxide emissions from both manure management and managed soils, along with emissions from fertilization and liming, were estimated using Tier 1 methodology.

The IPCC methodology was used to estimate greenhouse gas emissions in the waste sector. The IPCC employs the First Order Decay (FOD) method to estimate  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  emissions from solid waste disposal sites. This approach operates under the assumption that the degradable organic component (known as degradable organic carbon, DOC) in waste decays slowly over several decades, leading to the formation of  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . Assuming constant conditions, the rate of  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  production is solely dependent on the remaining carbon content in the waste. Consequently,  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  emissions from waste deposited in disposal sites peak in the initial years after deposition, gradually decreasing as the degradable carbon in the waste is consumed by decay-causing bacteria.

The emissions inventory covers all the key sectors required by the GPC and CoM methodologies, with data being aggregated for various reporting purposes in different ways, depending on the requirements of each report. Currently, the following sectors and sub-sectors are included in the inventory:

Stationary energy (scope 1 and 2)*
Residential buildings,
Institutional buildings and facilities

* As suggested by the Missions Info Kit for Cities, emissions from industrial facilities located within the city boundary which are registered under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) were excluded from the GHG emissions inventory. In the year 2018, four companies were part of the EU ETS. One of them is a public company for the distribution of district heat, which is owned by the city and for which decarbonization measures are planned; hence, these emissions were not excluded. However, emissions from the remaining three industrial facilities were exempted from the inventory (amounting to a total of 67,861 tons of CO₂ in the year 2018).

** Solid waste generated in the City of Ljubljana is disposed of at a landfill within the city boundary, so there are no emissions from waste generated within the city boundary but sent to landfill outside the city boundary (scope 3). On the contrary, at the waste disposal site within the city, waste from other (mostly neighbouring) municipalities is also deposited. Therefore, methane emissions from the waste disposal site were recalculated based on the share of disposed waste generated in the City of Ljubljana (scope 3 emissions belonging to other municipalities were excluded).

# ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE CITY OF LJUBLJANA

In the year 2018, a total of 7,584,702 MWh of energy was consumed in the City of Ljubljana, while energy consumption in 2022 amounted to 7,488,412 MWh, representing a decrease of 1.3% or 1.9% compared to the previous year when energy consumption was at its highest in the period under review. A significant decrease in energy use is also noticeable in the year 2020 when numerous restrictive measures were in place due to the Coronavirus, particularly affecting transportation, and industry.

In 2018, most of the energy was consumed in buildings (including public lighting), totalling 4,591,738 MWh, which accounts for 60.5% of the total energy consumption in the city (residential buildings dominate with 1,519,111 MWh or 20.0%). Transportation follows with a 39.4% share and a total estimated consumption of 2,984,926 MWh. On-road transportation dominates with 2,968,432 MWh or 39.1%. The energy consumption structure by energy sources is presented in the table in section A-1.1. Electricity and district heating are categorized under scope 2 and together account for 62.8% of energy use in buildings (with district heating at 24.9% and electricity at 37.9%). Natural gas follows in terms of energy consumed, representing 27.0% of energy use in buildings.

Energy and fuel consumption in buildings are no longer monitored at the municipal level in national statistics. Data on electricity consumption, natural gas, and district heat from the district heating system were obtained from distribution companies.

Data on the sale of extra-light heating oil and liquefied petroleum gas within the city were also obtained from suppliers. In addition, the quantities of consumed liquid fuels, wood biomass, and other heat sources for heating and hot water preparation in buildings were estimated using statistical models and machine learning. These estimates were used for those energy sources where there were not enough reliable data on actual consumption.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

In transportation, diesel fuel dominates, accounting for 61.1% of total energy consumption in transportation, followed by gasoline at 36.7%. Compressed natural gas (primarily for urban public transport), liquefied petroleum gas, and electricity, which predominates in rail transportation, represent smaller shares. Energy consumption in private and commercial road transportation was estimated based on a traffic model that considers traffic counters (traffic loads) on national and municipal roads, road lengths by category, the average fuel consumption of individual vehicle types, and the number of residents and travel habits of the population. Based on the calculated distances travelled on the road network within the geographical boundary of the city, the consumption of propulsion energy was estimated. Data for city-owned vehicles and public transportation were obtained from the city and the public transport provider.

# EMISSION FACTORS USED

With the provided emission factors, emissions of individual greenhouse gases in tons are calculated from primary energy in MWh. To convert  $\mathrm{CH}_4$ ,  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ , and F-gases into  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  equivalents, Global Warming Potential (GWP) factors from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report were used.

The Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories (GPC) methodology, which is based on IPCC guidelines, was used to estimate greenhouse gas emissions. To calculate the local emission factor for grid-supplied electricity consumption, a combination of the GPC and Covenant of Mayors (CoM) methodologies was used, as suggested in the Mission's Info Kit for Cities guidelines.

When calculating the local emission factor for grid-supplied electricity consumption, the national emission factor served as the baseline, which was adjusted based on local electricity production and emissions from local production, as well as purchases of green (carbon-free) electricity. Additionally, changes in the national emission factor over the years were considered, reflecting a gradual reduction in specific emissions due to the increasing integration of renewable sources in production and the phasing out of fossil fuels at the national level. Emissions resulting from local electricity production within the Ljubljana area were subtracted from the national emission factor to avoid double-counting, as recommended by the GPC methodology. The national emission factor is calculated annually by the Jožef Stefan Institute (data and methodology are available in Slovenian language here: https://ceu.ijs.si/izpusti-co2-tgp-na-enoto-elektricne-energije/).

As most of the electricity in the City of Ljubljana is generated through cogeneration (combined heat and power) primarily using brown coal and natural gas, this contributes to a higher local emission factor compared to the national factor, even though local solar and hydropower production is considered, along with the purchase of carbon-free electricity by the city administration. However, in the future, as coal is phased out and cogeneration units transition to renewable sources, the local emission factor for both electricity and district heating is expected to significantly decrease. Additionally, there will be a growing contribution from distributed renewable energy production, especially from solar power.

Similar to  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , local emission factors for  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  and  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  were also calculated for electricity and district heating. The emission factors provided in the table apply to the base year 2018.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The City of Ljubljana, which is an indirect owner of the district heating system through a public company, intends to reduce specific emissions for district heating by decarbonizing the district heating system (cogeneration). Several scenarios for transitioning from coal and natural gas to other energy sources (primarily renewables) are being developed. In addition to biomass cogeneration, plans include large water/water heat pumps (utilizing river heat), solar thermal collectors, waste heat utilization, and waste incineration. Furthermore, simulations of potential energy savings from the energy retrofitting of building stock supplied with district heating have already been prepared.

In addition to transitioning cogeneration plants for the district heating system, the installation of numerous new renewable energy production facilities, especially solar power plants of larger capacity, will contribute to reducing the local emission factor for grid-supplied electricity. The emission factor will also continue to decrease at the national level in the future. Also, increased purchases of electricity from renewable sources will affect the reduction of the local emission factor. More about planned emissions reduction measures is described in the following chapters.

For the year 2030, it is planned that the local emission factor for electricity consumption will reach a value of 0.01 tCO₂e/MWh while the specific emission of district heat will be 0.12 tCO₂e/MWh.

# GHG EMISSIONS IN THE CITY OF LJUBLJANA

Most GHG emissions in the City of Ljubljana are generated due to energy consumption in buildings, totalling 1,423,268 tons in 2018, which is 61.8% of total emissions in the city. Indirect emissions from electricity and district heating consumption (scope 2) dominated, amounting to 1,183,332 tons in 2018 (which is 83.1% of total emissions in buildings). Indirect emissions dominate due to a significant share of electricity (37.9%) and district heating (24.9%) consumption in buildings and a relatively high local emission factor for electricity and district heating consumption, as brown coal predominates in local energy production.

In 2018, transportation in the City of Ljubljana accounted for 34.4% of the total GHG emissions (791,604 tons), while waste management and wastewater treatment contributed 2.1% (48,500 tons). A smaller share came from the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector, contributing 1.0% (23,693 tons), and the Industrial Process and Product Use (IPPU) sector, with a 0.6% share (14,604 tons).

Within the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector, the City of Ljubljana had a net carbon sink of -54,449 tons (on land where land use has not been changed), primarily driven by forest land (-46,398 tons), settlements (-6,768 tons), grassland (-898 tons), and cropland (-385 tons). Remaining forest land contributed 85% to the net sinks, while changes in land use, like deforestation and conversion, resulted in a net source of 5,349 tons of CO₂ emissions. Overall, the city's net emissions/removals of CO₂ in 2018 were -49,100 tons.

|  Total | 7.94 | 7.52 | 6.95 | 7.33 | 7.21  |

In conclusion, the primary source of GHG emissions in the City of Ljubljana is energy consumption in buildings, with indirect emissions from electricity and district heating being the predominant contributors. Transportation plays a significant role in the city's overall emissions, constituting a notable portion of the carbon footprint. Waste management and wastewater treatment have a comparatively smaller impact on GHG emissions in the city while the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector and the Industrial Process and Product Use (IPPU) sector make minor contributions to the city's total emissions.

Current calculations consider Scope 1 (GHG emissions from sources within the city boundaries) and Scope 2 (GHG emissions resulting from the use of electricity, heat, steam, and/or cooling supplied

through networks within the city boundaries). Scope 3 emissions, representing all other greenhouse gas emissions occurring outside the city boundaries as a result of activities within the city boundaries, are not included in the current emission calculations.

In the stationary energy, scope 3 emissions include losses in the transmission and distribution of electricity, steam, heating, and cooling supplied through the network outside the city boundary. To enhance existing calculations, future efforts will involve obtaining data on losses in the electrical grid and incorporating them into the calculations. However, this is not feasible for district heating systems as they are located within the city's boundaries and are already accounted for in scope 2.

In the transport sector, when calculating emissions, we used the geographic or territorial assessment method, which quantifies traffic emissions within city boundary regardless of the origin or destination of travel. This model aligns with scope 1 emissions as it includes all traffic activities within the city boundaries. Additionally, we also utilized scope 2, which covers all electricity used for electric vehicles within the city. When using the geographic or territorial assessment method, scope 3 is not applicable, as it focuses on quantifying emissions within city boundaries and does not require assessment or quantification of emissions occurring outside the city boundary.

In the waste sector, when calculating emissions from waste processing, we used scope 1, which includes all greenhouse gas emissions from the treatment and disposal of waste within the city boundary, regardless of whether the waste is generated inside or outside the city limits. Only GHG emissions from waste generated by the city were included. Emissions from waste generated by the city but treated outside the city boundary (scope 3) were not calculated, as the city disposes and biologically treat all its waste as well as waste from neighbouring municipalities. Part of the waste that is not landfilled within the city and not recycled is used as fuel in incinerators outside the city boundary, which falls under scope 3. In the future, these emissions can also be included in calculations at the level of the City of Ljubljana.

Emissions from IPPU and AFOLU are calculated only for scope 1, while emissions outside the city are not included in the inventory (not applicable).

## 2.2 Module A-2 Current Policies and Strategies Assessment

Module A-2 "Current Policies and Strategies" lists and assesses existing policies, strategies, initiatives, or regulation from local, regional, and national level, relevant to the city's climate neutrality transition. This assessment contributes to identifying the gap (if any) between the emissions reduction due to existing initiatives and the city's 2030 climate neutrality target.

### A-2.1: Description &amp; assessment of policies

We have considered several existing policies, strategies, programmes, and regulations that impact (directly or indirectly) the 2030 climate neutrality ambition of City of Ljubljana. We have determined their relevance and influence on the climate ambition of Ljubljana as well as anticipated emission reductions attributed to these policies by 2030. The examination involves cross-referencing these policies with the action plan to prevent redundancy and ensure emission gap calculations. Furthermore, it investigates any potential overlap between these policies and the »Business as Usual scenario«, aiming to address the remaining emissions gap toward achieving the 2030 climate target.

Figure 17: Existing policies, strategies, programmes.

The listed strategies, policies, and action plans are supporting both ongoing and planned activities. The relevance of these policies and strategies is based on following criteria:

How they connect or bridge national, regional, and local priorities, considering alignment and coherence across different levels of governance, maximizing the impact of climate action efforts.
How they foster collaboration among crucial policy areas to advance climate neutrality, particularly at the local level. As integrating various policy domains such as energy, transportation, and land use planning, to promote holistic approaches to emissions reduction and sustainability.
How they promote collaboration and coordination to facilitate joint efforts within the region and on the national level to address shared challenges and opportunities related to climate action.

# Assessment (analysis) of relevant policies and strategies

The Ljubljana Vision by 2045, Local energy Concept of the City of Ljubljana 2022-2030 and Sustainable energy climate plan 2022-2030 (SECAP) are setting different emission reduction targets including zero emission target for 2045 and 2050, respectively. They are aligned with National
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Energy and Climate plan (NECP – i.e. national SECAP) and EU Green Deal, both setting zero emission target for 2050. However, our action plan sets this ambition for the year 2030, therefore it includes additional measures, or individual measures will be implemented more quickly, in shorter implementation period.

Local district heating network and natural gas distribution currently account for more than 1/3 of existing emissions, and Strategic plan of Energetika Ljubljana d.o.o. for period 2022 to 2027 (local district heating and gas network operator) already incorporates ambitions investments plans towards decarbonization of their production sources. Our Action plan builds on this strategy considering extra effort (i.e. additional measures, such as CCU – Carbon Capture and Use, for 138,029 t CO₂ of residual emissions buildings sector) to support our 2030 target. While the direct impact of the EU Hydrogen Strategy on Ljubljana's emission reduction targets may vary depending on the city's specific implementation plans and the deployment (availability) of hydrogen technologies, the integration of hydrogen into the energy mix (which is included in this action plan) offers opportunities for the transition to cleaner energy sources and thus already contributes to the city's 2030 emission reduction targets.

All the above policies are highly relevant and have direct impact on our climate neutrality ambition, however BAU scenario based only on them is not sufficient for 2030 zero emission scenario, therefore this action plan is way more ambitious, setting the same goals for as early as 2030 with its measures.

National Long-term strategy to promote the energy-efficient refurbishment of buildings, national Action plan for nearly zero-energy buildings and Energy efficiency directive are aligned with local targets as they all already apply to all new buildings and thus have a direct impact on Ljubljana's efforts to reduce energy consumption and achieve emission reduction target. However, AP goes beyond BAU scenario based on these policies, by setting more ambitious targets for 2030 (as outlined in Section B-2) in terms of renovation of existing buildings portfolio.

By emphasising sustainable mobility, the city aims to improve living standards, reduce pollution, and reduce emissions. Strategy Plan of the public company Ljubljanski potniški promet, d.o.o. for the period 2022 – 2027 already anticipates and is fully aligned with the action plan for achieving carbon neutrality, meaning that by 2030 all local public transport buses will be powered by renewable energy sources or electricity. On the other hand, both Sustainable Urban mobility plan for the city of Ljubljana and Plan for sustainable urban mobility in the Ljubljana city region (comprises 26 municipalities in central Slovenia) support short-term decarbonization of urban public transportation (and are thus aligned with AP), while both also focus on other areas of sustainable mobility such as promoting walking, cycling, etc. The primary issue where these strategies and plans lack a proper answer is transit traffic, which passes through the city via the motorway, and the city itself does not have decisive influence on its limitation. Therefore, within this action plan, we have envisaged a solution to neutralize emissions caused by transit traffic (i.e. residual emissions of 259,881 tCO₂e) with other measures outside the sector (CCU – Carbon Capture and Use).

The local Environmental Protection Program and Strategy for a circular city by 2045 is a key strategic document for the City of Ljubljana, outlining the vision of Ljubljana as an environmentally successful capital. It is based on the current environmental situation, establishing strategic goals, and specifying necessary measures to guide sustainable practices and development in spatial, economic, and social aspects within the city. It is important for co-benefits (e.g. air quality, water purification, mobility, local food production, etc.) that can indirectly reduce energy use and GHG emissions.

Spatial plan of the City of Ljubljana (2022) and its objective to develop a vision and strategy for the development of the city for the next 20 years in terms of harmonious spatial development of the city.

Climate Neutrality Action

Plan

#

The fundamental strategic objectives of the spatial development of City of Ljubljana are to maintain and strengthen the spatial, natural, and cultural values of the city as well as the wider surroundings of the City of Ljubljana, which mean the identity and potential for high-quality city development and quality of living in it. This also means that we prefer renovation or replacement of obsolete facilities over building new ones, however the construction of new facilities is never completely excluded. Sustainable spatial development contributes to more energy efficient building and consequently less carbon pollution due to decreased heat demand, which is aligned with this action plan. The long-term effects of city's sustainable spatial development, for example a well-managed Ljubljana's urban forest, will contribute to a gradual reduction in emissions.

The Strategy for the development of Ljubljana's urban forests (2020-2025), which is aligned with action plan for carbon neutrality, plays an important role in the implementation of the city's climate goals and emission reduction, since they create significant carbon sinks (49,900 t CO $_2$ e in 2018, with AP envisages extra effort of 15,800 t CO $_2$ e). The direct impact on emissions reduction based on this strategy may not be immediate, but the long-term effects of a well-managed urban forest strategy is significant and can contribute to additional reduction in emissions.

The Rural Development and Urban Agriculture Strategy of the City of Ljubljana for the period 2021-2027 defines the vision, objectives, measures, and activities for the development of rural areas and urban agriculture, also addresses cross-cutting themes such as adaptation to climate change and is in line with presented action plan.

Here is another series of important policies and strategies (e.g. Strategy for the development of Ljubljana and Ljubljana region as a tourist destination 2021-2027, Digital development strategy of the city of Ljubljana 2023-2030, Strategy for cultural development in the city of Ljubljana 2020-2023 with guidelines until 2027, Sports strategy of the city of Ljubljana until 2028, etc.) that may not have a direct short-term impact on emission reduction but contribute significantly to creating conditions for achieving and maintaining the city's goals in the long run. They notably influence on the quality of life in the city and on the content the city offers to its residents.

# LOCAL ENERGY CONCEPT THE CITY OF LJUBLJANA 2022-2030

## (Strategy - Action Plan for Sustainable Energy)

The Local Energy Concept (LEC) of the City of Ljubljana for the period from 2022 to 2030 consists of a status analysis and an action plan. The LEC represents a development concept for the local community in terms of energy supply and utilisation. It includes measures for the efficient use of energy and the procurement of energy from renewable sources, combined heat and power, waste heat and other sources. The concept outlines spatial and economic development plans for the city, focussing on the development of local energy services, efficient energy use and conservation, the use of renewable energy sources and the improvement of air quality in the city. The document contains specific targets and measures to save energy and increase the energy efficiency of buildings owned by local authorities and housing associations.

It also includes local plans for energy efficiency, taking into account long-term strategies to encourage investment in building renovations and the possibility of efficient individual heating and cooling systems. Seven main directions have been formulated:

Secure, competitive, and reliable energy supply and energy sources.
Ensuring energy efficiency throughout the energy chain and for all energy sources (generation, distribution, storage, consumption).
Energy independence or self-sufficiency of the city (vision by 2050).
Decarbonisation of the entire energy chain within the city.
Diversification of natural/renewable/waste resources.
A city without energy poverty.
Economic development of the city based on globally competitive production and services in the field of energy and environment.

The strategic objectives of the LEC are:

Reduce CO₂ emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 2008 levels.
Achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The specific target of reducing CO₂ emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 2008 shows a strong commitment to reducing emissions within a specific timeframe. The measures envisaged in this action plan will close the remaining gap by 2030.

# STRATEGIC PLAN OF ENERGETIKA LJUBLJANA d.o.o. for the period 2022-2027
(Development strategy for the city's district heating and local gas network)

The strategic goals of Energetika Ljubljana are related to the realisation of its basic mission - the comprehensive energy supply of the entire Ljubljana city region. This includes reliable, environmentally friendly and cost-effective performance through the management of cogeneration, distribution and supply of heating and industrial steam, distribution and supply of natural gas, energy supply, provision of system services for the operation of the electricity transmission network and the provision of services related to the construction, operation and maintenance of heating systems.

In the past, Energetika Ljubljana relied almost exclusively on fossil fuels. In order to reduce the carbon footprint, the production sources must be decarbonised. This means that coal, which previously accounted for 95% of the energy used, will gradually be replaced by natural gas, woody biomass, and the use of fuels from mixed municipal waste. In addition to the decarbonisation of conventional production sources, the integration of decentralised renewable energy sources (e.g. solar power plants) and flexibility sources (e.g. batteries, electric charging stations, demand response, heat pumps, etc.) is essential. These will enable the company to actively engage in the market for ancillary services and flexibility. The company's strategic goals for the period from 2022 to 2027 are:

Decarbonisation of production sources and district heating supply.
Decarbonisation of the natural gas distribution system.
Ensure high reliability in the operation of production sources and distribution networks for district heating and natural gas.
Mitigating the decline in demand, developing, and increasing the utilisation of the district heating network.
Developing and increasing the utilisation of the natural gas network by expanding its use in the transport sector.
Generation and supply of green electricity.
Provision of system services for the electricity grid.
Supplying users, integrating products and services into new, customer-attractive packages, and thus offering a comprehensive energy service.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Energy Systems.

# SUSTAINABLE ENERGY CLIMATE PLAN 2022-2030
(SECAP)

The overall objective of SECAP is to foster the sustainable development of the cross-border territory by promoting low-carbon strategies for all types of territory, in particular urban areas, creating relevant adaptation and mitigation measures. The project will lead to the cross-border sharing of tools, methodologies and databases and will generate positive effects on local planning in the whole programme area. The transition to a low-carbon society will be implemented in the infrastructure interventions of two (case) project partners and in the evolution of SEAPs into SECAPs for some municipalities/ITUs/metropolitan cities. The sustainable development models of the Covenant of Mayors will therefore be promoted by improving the quality of life and resilience to climate change.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Mobility and Transport.

# SUSTAINABLE URBAN MOBILITY PLAN FOR THE CITY OF LJUBLJANA (Action Plan - SUMP)

The strategy aims to replace the current transport system with more sustainable and environmentally friendly modes of transport. It emphasises long-term planning and includes a green urban policy, the strategic integration of electromobility and specific action plans to change travel habits that promote public transport, cycling, walking and active mobility. The strategy addresses the impact of transport on various aspects of urban development and prioritises sustainability, mobility, and accessibility to achieve climate neutrality. Sustainable mobility promotes a higher quality of life, green urban spaces and social inclusion. The vision prioritises sustainable transport and active mobility and promotes local living and social equity.

In order to achieve the targets, set by the European Union to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 compared to 2008 levels, transport must be comprehensively planned. Sustainable mobility is therefore a crucial prerequisite for connecting people and ensuring access to goods in such a way that the environment can be sustainably protected and favourable living conditions can be maintained in the long term.

In 2012, we adopted the City of Ljubljana's Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, which focuses on limiting motorised private transport and changing people's travel habits to more sustainable ways - walking, cycling or public transport - and on distributing mobility in such a way that one third of journeys are made by public transport, one third on foot or by bicycle and one third by private vehicle.
In 2017, we updated the plan for sustainable urban mobility from 2012. We redefined the goal for an even better quality of life in Ljubljana in cooperation with various stakeholders and on the basis of our achievements to date. We have committed to making two thirds of journeys in a sustainable way by 2027 - on foot, by bike and by public transport.

The comprehensive transport strategy builds on the City of Ljubljana's previous efforts to promote sustainable mobility. It includes continuous spatial planning based on various already adopted documents (e.g. the City Spatial Plan, etc.).

The fact that modern transport planning prioritises the mobility of people over vehicle traffic is widely accepted, which also changes the perspective of spatial planning. Sustainable mobility means choosing modes of transport that are spatially, financially, and environmentally more efficient, healthier, safer and contribute to a higher quality of life. The City of Ljubljana is constantly endeavouring to promote walking, cycling and the use of public transport, while at the same time reducing the number of car journeys. The comprehensive transport strategy is a continuation of these efforts and emphasises the mobility of people rather than vehicles. On this basis, four main pillars of sustainable mobility have been established, followed by 21 individual strategic objectives.

Corresponding actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Mobility and transport.

# SPATIAL PLAN OF THE CITY OF LJUBLJANA (2022)

(Plan for the spatial development of the city)
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The main objective of the Spatial Development Plan of the City of Ljubljana is to develop a vision and strategy for the development of the city in the next fifteen to twenty years that will enable the harmonious spatial development of the city. During this period, it is crucial to:

Upgrade the already built-up areas to a high standard.
Eliminate scattered construction or other underutilised areas.
Building a resilient city through climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, as well as measures to rehabilitate buildings and areas that jeopardise people's health.
Sustainable settlement expansion, with the construction of buildings outside designated areas only permitted in exceptional cases necessary for the development of the city.
Promoting sustainable land use by taking into account the principles of rational land use, a long-term secure natural drinking water supply, efficient energy use, the promotion of sustainable mobility and the use of public transport, the preservation of green spaces, the implementation of nature-based solutions and the promotion of local self-sufficiency in all spatial reorganisations and redevelopments of existing urban areas.

# STRATEGY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LJUBLJANA'S URBAN FORESTS 2020-2025 (Strategy for urban forestry)

The Strategy for the Development of Ljubljana's Urban Forests defines the vision and long-term priorities for the comprehensive development of Ljubljana's urban forests. The strategy serves as a basis for the management of urban forests in order to ensure a high-quality living environment for residents. It expresses the interest of the local population in the city's forests and their immediate surroundings and at the same time contributes to responsible forest management planning. The strategy initiated by the City of Ljubljana was developed as part of the Interreg project URBforDAN for the area of Ljubljana's urban forests, which includes those forests that are designated as forests with clearly emphasised social functions according to the urban spatial plan.

The aim of the strategy is to encourage various institutions, non-governmental organisations and individuals to actively participate in the decision-making processes for the development of Ljubljana's urban forests. It also aims to raise awareness of the importance of these forests, improve the basis for forest management and strengthen the social and ecological functions of Ljubljana's urban forests. The strategy is in line with current legislation and takes into account the objectives for the development of forests and green areas set out in other spatial and sectoral plans and guidelines. The preparation of the strategy was led by the City of Ljubljana - Department of Economic Activities and Transport - and the Slovenian Forest Institute. Numerous experts from administrative and research institutions as well as consulting companies contributed to the development of the strategy. The strategy outlines seven priorities for the management of urban forests in Ljubljana:

Ensuring a healthy living environment.
Providing opportunities for leisure activities, recreation, and promotion of sustainable tourism.
Creating opportunities for education and lifelong learning.
Preserving nature and cultural heritage.
Creating a supportive environment for forest owners.
Promoting circular economy practices.
Developing comprehensive management.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Based on the strategy, operational plans will be prepared for specific areas within the urban forests of Ljubljana. These plans detail the implementation of activities related to the use of forests for leisure and recreation, including the development of infrastructure, visitor management systems, the establishment of urban infrastructure, communication with forest owners and visitors, as well as awareness raising, education and stakeholder involvement.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions.

## DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OF THE CITY OF LJUBLJANA 2023-2030
**(Strategy for digital development)**

The strategy aims to use modern digital solutions to overcome challenges, improve city services and optimise the interaction between the city administration and its citizens. This approach aims to simplify and speed up the management of urban processes, improve efficiency and promote collaboration with businesses and academia, while ensuring the security and utility of data for the benefit of citizens.

Digital development will contribute to greater carbon neutrality and economic progress in the city. Through the targeted use of digital solutions, the City of Ljubljana will drive the implementation of various urban strategies, with a focus on climate neutrality.

Relevant actions/measures in section B-2: All action areas.

## STRATEGY FOR A CIRCULAR CITY BY 2045
**(Strategy for the circular economy)**

The aim of the document is to support Ljubljana on its path towards a circular economy by involving the widest possible range of stakeholders, their existing practices, innovation potentials and specific initiatives.

The basic idea of a circular economy is to preserve value in the production and consumption cycle for as long as possible. In contrast to a linear economy, in which the "take-make-dispose" model is applied, the value chains in a circular economy are geared towards getting the most out of resources, with a focus on careful and rational use. The new circular economy models revolve around reuse, repair, refurbishment and sharing, maximising the efficiency of (re)used resources, supported by the right design and manufacturing of services and products, as well as circular processes in production and consumption. This means a transition from waste management to resource management, with the ultimate goal being "zero waste". The City of Ljubljana acts within planetary boundaries and strives for the well-being of all people by integrating economic, environmental, and social aspects.

The document covers three levels:

Overarching vision of the city until 2045 - consistency of all COL strategic documents and their compatibility with EU and national legislation in order to achieve optimal synergies and effective performance.
Strategic guidelines that include circular principles - link to the city's code for sustainable and circular urban management.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

6

Concrete activities in the 2027 perspective and guidance to monitor their implementation - an open process that allows the involvement of different actors to create closed loops for selected areas.

The circular economy is a horizontal content, and its principles are to be integrated into all sectoral strategies.

# SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OF THE CITY OF LJUBLJANA 2023-2027

(Urban development strategy)

The strategy includes an implementation plan for other investments/projects contributing to the comprehensive city development approach. In the operative sense, with the indication of key project. Priority projects and measures are the ones with a higher chance of implementation in the program period. This means their execution has already been confirmed in the budget of the City of Ljubljana and project documentation has already been prepared or the construction permits for the implementation have already been obtained.

Strategic development goals of the City of Ljubljana wish to preserve the already recognised quality of life in the city and strengthen necessary development activities appropriate for the times we are living in. The City of Ljubljana is also aware of its responsibility as the most important urban centre in the country, and at the same time, its competences, and capacities.

The Sustainable Urban Strategy of the City of Ljubljana and the Implementation Plan for the Sustainable Urban Strategy of the City of Ljubljana are development documents which the City of Ljubljana also needs to absorb EU funds, primarily to absorb funds within the Comprehensive Territorial Investment mechanism.

# THE RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND URBAN AGRICULTURE STRATEGY

(Strategy for rural development and agriculture)

The Rural Development and Urban Agriculture Strategy of the City of Ljubljana for the period 2021-2027 defines the vision, objectives, measures, and activities for the development of rural areas and urban agriculture from 2021 to 2027.

Main goals of the strategy are:

Ensuring adequate conditions for quality food production and achieving a higher level of self-sufficiency.
Well-connected rural providers and rural offerings.
Informed and responsible citizens who actively support a well-recognized rural area.
Vital, attractive, and promising rural area with preserved identity.

During the formulation of the objectives, several external factors were identified, the future development of which can significantly affect both the efficiency and the success of pursuing the above-defined objectives. Therefore, in addition to the presented objectives, the Rural

# STRATEGY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LJUBLJANA AS A TOURIST DESTINATION AND THE LJUBLJANA REGION 2021-2027

(Strategy for the development of tourism in the city)

The strategy builds on the findings that Ljubljana achieved enviable development results in the previous strategy period. Therefore, it makes sense to continue building on the foundations, such as ensuring coexistence between the local population and tourists, spreading the tourist offer beyond the narrow city centre, adhering to sustainability principles and developing tourist offers that lead to increased visitor spending.

With the new strategy, Tourism Ljubljana aims to position the Slovenian capital as a leading and most creative urban destination for a sustainable lifestyle worldwide. The new strategy introduces a number of substantive innovations aimed at creating innovative tourist experiences and attractions, extending the average length of stay in the destination, increasing daily tourist spending and connecting tourism with other important sectors.

The qualitative objectives focus on the satisfaction of locals and tourists, the development and diversification of the tourism offer outside the city centre, the improvement of accessibility and sustainable mobility, international recognition and awards and the development of an internationally recognised brand.

According to the strategy, the tourism sector must become a more important partner in urban planning. Improving accessibility, especially by improving rail connections and rail infrastructure, must be a priority for the city government, with strong support from the national government.

At the same time, sustainable mobility within the destination must be further promoted, especially in the areas of public transport, cycling, green transport, park-and-ride schemes, bus mobility, etc. To avoid overcrowding in the city centre, the development of new tourism products must take place in less developed and less upgraded areas of the city.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Green infrastructure and nature-based solutions.

# CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IN THE CITY OF LJUBLJANA 2020-2023 WITH GUIDELINES UNTIL 2027

(Strategy for cultural development)

The cultural development strategy, the fourth in a row, addresses the most important challenges facing society.

We began drafting the strategy in collaboration with public institutions, non-governmental organisations and individuals before the coronavirus outbreak and completed it when this new reality had already had a major impact on the cultural sector. In addition to the general priority tasks
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

and objectives, the document includes a chapter on culture in times of crisis. The preparation of the document was also strongly influenced by Ljubljana's bid for the title of European Capital of Culture 2025.

The new cultural strategy contains a number of substantive innovations that conceptually establish a new paradigm for Ljubljana's cultural policy. It is based on the conclusion that cultural policy is truly progressive when it is able to adapt and meet the challenges of the cultural and creative sectors and society as a whole.

Among the substantive innovations that we are introducing in the area of culture by the end of 2023 in line with the strategy, we emphasise the following:

Stronger international orientation with the aim of positioning Ljubljana more strongly as a globally recognised city that offers its citizens and all visitors cultural and artistic programmes of the highest quality.
Increased cultural co-operation with the municipalities within the Ljubljana city region with the aim of creating new audiences, a new regional cultural identity, lasting connections between cultural professionals and the mobility of artists.
Expansion of the network of artist residencies for domestic and foreign artists.
Support for participatory cultural projects and programmes that strengthen social cohesion and the inclusion of members of disadvantaged groups in social life.
Support for community projects proposed by the residents of Ljubljana to improve the quality of life in their local environment.
Establishing a system that enables the inclusion of the so-called "artistic share" in investment projects of the City of Ljubljana.

The strategy aims to organise sustainable cultural events, raise awareness, promote the reuse of materials, and educate residents about animal and nature conservation and the importance of biodiversity in the city.

Relevant actions/measures in section B-2: All fields of action.

# SPORTS STRATEGY OF THE CITY OF LJUBLJANA UNTIL 2028

## (Strategy for sport)

The City of Ljubljana Sports Strategy until 2028 defines the mission of the City of Ljubljana, which together with the sports development programme providers (i.e. the Public Institute Sport Ljubljana, the Ljubljana Sports Association, other sports associations, sports clubs, primary and secondary schools, the university, and other providers) fulfils the public interest in the field of sports.

The strategy therefore emphasises sustainability, accessibility, competent staff, and fairness. It aims to increase sports participation among residents, from children to senior citizens, and to improve sports facilities.

In terms of sustainability and the city's climate goals, the strategy aims to minimise waste at sporting events. Participants can use free public buses to get to the city centre or park for free in designated areas. Waste separation and recycling bins are available and ensure efficient use of resources. Key sports infrastructure developments have been designed with carbon neutrality in mind and focus on environmentally friendly design and energy efficient practices.

# THE PROGRAMME FOR PROTECTION AGAINST NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS
(Programme for protection against natural disasters)

Protection against natural and other disasters is one of the fundamental original competencies of local communities. This is particularly important for the City of Ljubljana. On one hand, there are hazards: the area of the City of Ljubljana is threatened by fires, floods, landslides, storms, accidents involving hazardous substances, air pollution, major traffic accidents, earthquakes, and other hazards, including climate change. On the other hand, there are social characteristics, referred to as vulnerability elements in relation to disasters: Ljubljana is the capital and largest city, the city of numerous institutions, the city with the largest population, the intersection of the Slovenian traffic hub, the city with many cultural, historical, and other important objects and activities taking place in them. Due to all vulnerability elements, each disaster in the City of Ljubljana has a much greater social impact than it would elsewhere in Slovenia, as disasters have social consequences that exceed the direct physical consequences of the disaster in a highly structured, complex urban environment with a multitude of critical services. This especially refers to interruptions in the supply of services important for both residents and organizations: electricity, water, sewage disposal, waste collection, telecommunications, information technologies, public and other transportation, payment network, supply of food and other products, health and social care, etc.

The program follows the overarching objective of protecting against natural and other disasters in our community, which is to reduce the number of accidents and prevent or mitigate their consequences, thus making life safer and of higher quality. It is oriented towards prevention, which is more effective and also cheaper in the long run than other forms of protection against natural and other disasters. Because it is not possible to eliminate or sufficiently mitigate all hazards that cause accidents, the program equally addresses all forms of protection against natural and other disasters, which enable prompt and effective action in case of accidents, namely protection, rescue, and assistance, as well as ensuring basic living conditions.

Relevant actions/measures in section B-2: Natural based solutions.

# ZERO WAST STRATEGY
(Zero waste strategy)

Ljubljana's Zero Waste Strategy embraces EU waste management best practices by prioritising waste prevention. The Slovenian capital's exemplary approach to managing urban waste and developing a local circular economy is multi-pronged. Such a strategy facilitates recycling and reuse, improves the separation and treatment of waste, and encourages citizens and businesses to reduce the amount of waste they generate in the first place. This is a remarkable achievement, accomplished over the past decade, in which policymakers, businesses and citizens have worked together to create a more sustainable urban environment. As part of its commitment to zero waste, the city aims to halve its amount of residual waste and to improve its recycling rate to 78 per cent by 2025.

It outlines the instruments and resources for the realisation of those objectives. It comprises a strategic and a programming section. The strategic section contains an analysis of regional development potentials, a definition of the region's key development obstacles and strengths and of its development objectives, vision and priorities over the programming period, and a definition of the region's development specialisation. The programming part contains programmes for stimulating development within the region, with a timetabled and financial evaluation of those programmes, and sets out a system for monitoring, evaluating, and organising the implementation of the Regional Development Programme (RDP).

The key challenges facing the region are high daily commuting levels, which are the result of the marked centralisation of services within its centre, the negative impacts of traffic (e.g. pollution, noise, accidents, traffic congestion), a large share of young jobseekers and the departure of the educated workforce from the region. It has been estimated that investment is needed in the construction of water supply infrastructure in almost half the 25 municipalities that make up the LUR; there is also a considerable need for investment in wastewater drainage and treatment in agglomerations generating a load of less than 2,000 p.e. The region is also home to a large number of flood-risk areas, which places something of a restriction on development. In national terms, Ljubljana is among those areas at highest risk of flooding, with 15 of the 25 municipalities within the LUR having high flood-risk levels.

## PLAN FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN MOBILITY IN THE LJUBLJANA CITY REGION
(Action Plan - SUMP)

The Ljubljana Urban Region (LUR) comprises 26 municipalities in central Slovenia and is the region with the greatest potential for knowledge and creativity: important national, scientific, research, educational and cultural institutions are concentrated here. It is also home to numerous companies that employ a large number of people and generate more than a third of Slovenia's gross domestic product. The Ljubljana Urban Region (LUR) strategy is an innovative, sustainable approach that aims to reduce car use, promote public transport and improve the quality of life in the Ljubljana urban region.

The strategy plays a crucial role in efforts to achieve climate neutrality. By focusing on sustainable mobility and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through measures such as the promotion of walking, cycling, public transport and low-emission vehicles, it addresses the challenges of urban transport and ultimately supports the climate neutrality goals.

Corresponding actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Mobility and transport.

## NATIONAL LEVEL

## NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA (NECP)
(National SECAP – 2023 revision proposal)

The action plan has been coordinated with the National Climate Strategy and sets out the most important measures and targets up to 2030 in five defined areas: decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, the internal energy market, research and development and competitiveness.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The Comprehensive National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) is Slovenia's guiding document and an important step towards a climate-neutral Slovenia and the European Union (EU) by 2050. It outlines Slovenia's energy and climate targets, policies, and measures to achieve these targets by 2030 and by 2040.

The NECP's objectives are supported by a comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA), which is a formal part of the NECP preparation process. In addition to assessing the environmental impacts, the EIA allows for broad stakeholder participation (ministries, organisations, NGOs, sectors, interested individuals) to determine the appropriate way for Slovenia to achieve the objectives. The EIA process continues through public consultations and definitions and leaves room for additional considerations within the NECP proposal and the Environmental Report.

The most ambitious goal of the NECP is to improve energy and resource efficiency across all sectors, thereby reducing the consumption of energy and natural resources - a first and crucial step towards a climate-neutral society. This has a significant impact on other areas (decarbonisation, energy security, the internal energy market, research, and innovation).

Slovenia aims to increase energy efficiency by 35% compared to the base year 2007. Fulfilment of the NECP targets will lead to less dependence on fossil fuels and increased reuse. The NECP is also committed to sustainable solutions in the areas of transport (sustainable public transport), buildings (heating, cooling, major renovation) and industry (ongoing competitiveness). Currently, transport accounts for over 50% of emissions in Slovenia (outside the EU Emissions Trading Scheme).

Through an active national approach and co-operation, we can ensure that energy costs do not become an even greater burden. At the same time, we are making an important contribution to decentralised and local electricity generation by empowering users to opt for better solutions and become active participants - which requires adequate support from the state. Sustainable solutions such as the introduction of heat pumps and the construction of solar power plants are already demonstrating their cost-effectiveness in the medium term and offer significant environmental benefits in the long term, thereby fulfilling our responsibility to future generations.

Ljubljana's alignment with national strategies such as the NECP ensures a coherent and concerted effort to achieve emission reduction and climate targets by 2030. By harmonising local actions with overarching national targets, the city can effectively contribute to Slovenia's wider efforts to transition to a more sustainable and climate-resilient future.

## SLOVENIA'S LONG-TERM CLIMATE STRATEGY 2050
(National climate strategy)

The document outlines Slovenia's commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2050, aligning with EU regulations and the Paris Agreement. It emphasizes the importance of immediate action across all sectors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon society, upgrade existing policies, and halt practices contrary to emission reduction goals. The strategy is built on principles of sustainability, inclusiveness, and scientific findings, aiming for a climate-resilient society based on energy efficiency, renewable sources, and a circular economy. Key
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

focuses include enhancing biodiversity as a climate action strategy, integrating climate policy across sectors, and fostering innovations for a sustainable transition. This comprehensive approach underlines the necessity of multi-level cooperation, from local to international, ensuring that Slovenia's actions contribute effectively to global climate goals. This strategy is aligned with the European Green Deal, including the Just Transition Mechanism. The principle of a just transition is crucial to ensure that the move towards climate neutrality leaves no one behind and supports those most affected.

Relevant actions/measures in section B-2: All fields of action.

## ACTION PLAN FOR REDUCING ENERGY POVERTY FOR PERIOD OF 3 YEARS
*(Action plan for reducing energy poverty)*

Action Plan for Reducing Energy Poverty for a Three-Year Period outlines a comprehensive strategy aimed at mitigating energy poverty within Slovenia. It establishes a framework for targeted interventions, financial measures, and collaborative efforts across sectors to enhance energy efficiency and promote the use of renewable energy sources among the energy-poor households. The plan prioritizes the mobilization of approximately €55 million from 2021 to 2027, focusing on the most affected regions to alleviate the socio-economic consequences of energy poverty. By fostering innovations, providing financial incentives, and offering technical support, the plan seeks to ensure an inclusive transition to a more sustainable, low-carbon economy, ensuring that no one is left behind. The approach is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing national energy and climate strategies, reinforcing Slovenia's commitment to energy security, sustainability, and social equity.

Relevant actions/measures in section B-2: Energy systems.

## LONG-TERM STRATEGY TO PROMOTE THE ENERGY-EFFICIENT REFURBISHMENT OF BUILDINGS
*(National strategy for energy renovation of buildings)*

The long-term strategy to promote the energy renovation of buildings, in accordance with Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, mandates Member States to develop a strategy to promote investment in the renovation of the national building stock, covering both public and private residential and commercial buildings. Slovenia has adopted this long-term strategy in accordance with Article 348 of the Energy Act (EZ-1) and has laid down specific provisions:

Identification of bodies responsible for energy renovations in the public sector.

Assessment of building areas owned and used by public organisations.
Determination of the share of refurbishment in the total usable area of buildings in the public sector.
Review of the national building stock on the basis of statistical samples.
Define cost-effective renovation approaches for different types of buildings, taking into account their category, location and climate zone.
Develop strategies and measures to promote cost-effective comprehensive building renovation.
Initiatives to guide investment decisions by private individuals, construction companies and financial institutions.
Assessment of expected energy savings and overall benefits.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

This strategy focuses in particular on buildings in the narrower public sector and requires an annual renovation of 3% of their total useful floor area from 1 January 2014 to ensure that they meet at least the minimum energy efficiency requirements set out in Directive 2010/31/EU.

It must comply with all associated programmes and action plans, be updated every three years, and provide for comprehensive building renovation, taking into account the structure, including the building envelope, equipment, operation and maintenance. Buildings with the lowest energy efficiency are prioritised for renovation where technically and economically feasible.

The strategy pays particular attention to culturally protected buildings, with the exception of buildings used for national defence, excluding individual residential or commercial premises, and ritual or religious purposes. Slovenia aims to significantly improve the energy efficiency of its building stock and sees this strategy as the basis for the implementation of the Operational Programme for the Implementation of the European Cohesion Policy for 2014-2020. The targets are described for the crucial years 2020 or 2023 (the final year of the OP ECP) and 2030, assessing energy savings, required public funding and job creation. For 2050, only the expected energy savings are estimated.

The long-term strategy to promote the energy renovation of buildings directly supports Ljubljana's emission reduction targets by prioritising the improvement of energy efficiency in the building sector. Through mandatory renovations, targeted improvements and integration into national and European programmes, this strategy contributes significantly to the city's wider efforts to reduce energy consumption and emissions from buildings.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Energy Efficiency.

## ACTION PLAN FOR NEARLY ZERO-ENERGY BUILDINGS
(National Action Plan for Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings - SEAP)

The action plan for nearly zero-energy buildings stipulates that all new buildings must fulfil the criteria for nearly zero energy. This mandate, taken from Directive 2010/31/EU, outlines the technical definition of such buildings and prescribes the obligation to introduce them in Slovenia. The law requires the government to adopt and renew an action plan for nearly zero-energy buildings every three years, outlining the targets, programmes and measures to achieve these goals, with a focus on public buildings.

The directive stipulates that all new buildings constructed after 31 December 2020 must be nearly zero-energy buildings, with public buildings having to meet this standard two years earlier. To comply with the directive, member states must draw up national plans to increase the number of nearly zero-energy buildings and adopt policies to promote the conversion of renovated buildings into nearly zero-energy buildings. Slovenia has carried out cost-optimal analyses for energy efficiency requirements, which form the basis for the definition of nearly zero-energy buildings.

The technical definition of such buildings sets specific criteria that limit the energy demand for heating, cooling, hot water, and lighting in accordance with building legislation (PURES 2010), including the maximum primary energy consumption and the minimum share of renewable energy in the total energy supply of the building. The planned reduction in heating requirements for buildings from 48 kWh/m2a to 25 kWh/m2a is in line with the transition to nearly zero-energy structures.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

This action plan already applies to all new buildings and thus contributes to Ljubljana's emission reduction targets.

Corresponding actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Energy Efficiency.

# EU-LEVEL

## EUROPEAN GREEN DEAL (Strategy &amp; regulation)

The European Green Deal is a package of policy initiatives, which aims to set the EU on the path to a green transition, with the ultimate goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2050.

It supports the transformation of the EU into a fair and prosperous society with a modern and competitive economy.

It underlines the need for a holistic and cross-sectoral approach in which all relevant policy areas contribute to the ultimate climate-related goal. The package includes initiatives covering the climate, the environment, energy, transport, industry, agriculture, and sustainable finance – all of which are strongly interlinked.

The European climate law regulation turns the political ambition of reaching climate neutrality by 2050 into a legal obligation for the EU.

By adopting it, the EU and its member states committed to cutting net greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This target is legally binding and based on an impact assessment carried out by the Commission.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: All fields of action.

## ENERGY EFFICIENCY DIRECTIVE (EU Regulation)

Energy efficiency contributes to reducing overall energy consumption and is therefore central to achieving the EU's climate change objectives, while improving current and future energy security and affordability. To ensure that the EU's 2030 target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% (compared to 1990) can be achieved, the Commission has revised the Energy Efficiency Directive together with other energy and climate legislation.

The revised Directive for 2023 raises the EU energy efficiency target so that EU countries are obliged to collectively ensure an additional 11.7% reduction in energy consumption by 2030 compared to the 2020 reference scenario projections. As a result, the EU's total energy consumption should not exceed 992.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) for primary energy and 763 Mtoe for final energy by 2030.

Under the updated rules, EU countries have agreed to contribute to the EU target by setting indicative national contributions based on a combination of objective criteria reflecting national circumstances (energy intensity, GDP per capita, energy saving potential and reduction in fixed energy consumption). The Directive also includes an improved "gap-filler" mechanism that is triggered when countries fall behind in making their national contributions.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

This new target underlines the EU's increased ambition in the area of energy efficiency and exceeds the 9% target proposed by the Commission in July 2021 as part of the Fit for 55 package and goes even further than the existing 2030 target set in 2018. Under the revised directive and as part of their energy efficiency commitments, EU countries will have to achieve an average annual energy savings rate of 1.49% from 2024 to 2030, up from 0.8% in the 2021-2023 period, to achieve energy savings in critical sectors such as buildings, industry and transport. To emphasise the exemplary role of the public sector, there is also a new annual energy savings target of 1.9% for the entire public sector, and the 3% annual building renovation obligation will be extended to all levels of public administration.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Energy systems.

## EU HYDROGEN STRATEGY
### (EU Strategy)

The EU Hydrogen Strategy (COM/2020/301) was adopted in 2020 and proposed policy measures in five areas: Investment promotion, promotion of production and demand, creation of a hydrogen market and infrastructure, research and cooperation, and international cooperation.

The full list of 20 key actions was implemented by the first quarter of 2022. Hydrogen is also an important part of the EU's energy system integration strategy.

While the direct impact of the EU Hydrogen Strategy on Ljubljana's emission reduction targets may vary depending on the city's specific implementation plans and the deployment of hydrogen technologies, the integration of hydrogen into the energy mix (which is included in this action plan) offers opportunities for the transition to cleaner energy sources and thus already contributes to the city's 2030 emission reduction targets.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Energy systems.

## EU's FIT-FOR-55
### (EU Strategy)

Fit for 55 package refers to the EU's target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and to make EU climate-neutral by 2050. The package of proposals aims at providing a coherent and balanced framework for reaching the EU's climate objectives, which:

ensures a just and socially fair transition,
maintains and strengthens innovation and competitiveness of EU industry while ensuring a level playing field vis-à-vis third country economic operators,
underpins the EU's position as leading the way in the global fight against climate change.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: All fields of action.

## RePowerEU POLICY
### (EU Policy)

The policy emphasizes a multi-faceted approach to reducing EU dependency on Russian fossil fuels, highlighting the significance of diversifying energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, and boosting renewable energy production and use. It sets ambitious targets for renewable hydrogen and biomethane, highlighting the need for substantial investments in new technologies and
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

infrastructure, and the importance of sector-wide changes towards cleaner energy alternatives. This policy's objectives directly support the assignment's goals to enhance energy security, promote a green transition, and build resilience against supply disruptions.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: Energy systems.

## THE JUST TRANSITION MECHANISM (JTM) (EU mechanism)

An EU mechanism designed to support regions and industries that heavily rely on fossil fuels and high-carbon activities in their transition towards a more sustainable, low-carbon economy. It provides targeted support to help mobilize about €55 billion over the period 2021–2027 in the most affected regions to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the transition. It focuses on alleviating the social and economic impacts of this transition by providing targeted financial support, investments, and technical assistance. This mechanism strives to ensure that no one is left behind during the shift to a green economy, supporting affected workers, communities, and businesses.

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: All fields of action.

## THE TECHNICAL GUIDANCE ON CLIMATE PROOFING OF INFRASTRUCTURE (EU Technical guidance)

The Technical Guidance on Climate Proofing of Infrastructure (2021/C 373/01) provides technical guidance on the climate proofing of investments in infrastructure covering the programming period 2021-2027. It is consistent with the Paris Agreement and EU climate objectives, which means it is consistent with a credible greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction pathway in line with the EU's new climate targets for 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050, as well as with climate-resilient development. It follows the principle "energy efficiency first", which is defined in Article 2(18) of Regulation EU 2018/1999 and it follows the principle "do no significant harm" (DNSH).

Relevant actions/measures are included in Section B-2: All fields of action.

## THE TAXONOMY REGULATION (EU Regulation)

It is a framework to classify economic activities according to their contribution to six environmental objectives, namely:

The city estimates the emissions gap to be addressed in the Climate Action Plan at 950,514 t CO₂e. The residual GHG emissions in 2030 are estimated at 460,316 t CO₂e (20.0%). Emission sources which will not be feasible to eliminate till 2030 are coming from transport and building sectors. The transport sector's contribution to baseline emissions is around one third. Despite very optimistic and ambitious measures, 259,881 tonnes of CO₂e or 56.5% of total residual emissions would remain in the transport sector. Residual emissions in the buildings sector would amount to 138,029 tonnes (30.0%), emissions from waste management to 28,510 tonnes (6.2%), in agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) to 20,058 tonnes (4.4%) excluding natural carbon removals and in the industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector to 13,838 tonnes (3.0%). In total, the remaining emissions amount to 460,316 tonnes of CO₂e and are offset by natural carbon sinks in forests and other areas and by carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies to achieve climate neutrality. To achieve the set target, measures are planned to increase the natural carbon sinks in the City of Ljubljana to reach the target value of -65,700 tonnes of natural CO₂ sink. With a focus on forest areas, grassland, urban green areas and cropland, measures will be implemented to further strengthen efforts to increase natural carbon sinks. This will strengthen the role of forests and other natural ecosystems as efficient carbon sinks and contribute to more sustainable land management in the urban environment. To reduce the remaining residual emissions, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies will be used. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology cannot be used in Slovenia due to the unsuitable geological structure, so the CCU technology will be used instead.

See also: B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions.

The highest residual emissions that cannot be fully contained are still in the transport sector, as most of this sector currently depends on the use of fossil fuels. The City of Ljubljana is located within the pan-European transport network, which comprises ten corridors, among them Corridor V and Corridor X. Since these corridors (motorways) facilitate transit, a substantial portion of the traffic passing through is transit traffic. Ljubljana's strategic location at the intersection of these two corridors enhances its favourable traffic conditions. Since the city of Ljubljana has no control over transit traffic passing through its territory, it also has no influence on reducing this traffic and consequently reducing emissions. The reduction of emissions from transit traffic primarily depends on transitioning vehicles to zero-emission energy sources at the national and broader levels.

In the building sector, despite ambitious measures, there remains a residual 138,029 t CO₂e, mainly due to the planned waste-to-energy plant, where part of the waste-derived fuel is fossil-based. This facility will be integrated as a production unit into the district heating system, resulting in heat consumers not being completely decarbonized. Additionally, a small portion of energy consumption in the industrial sector remains on natural gas. Complete decarbonization is not possible because, in addition to CO₂, emissions of CH₄ and N₂O are also considered, which are released even with carbon-neutral fuels.

By 2030, despite implementing waste reduction measures and waste management, it is expected that approximately 28,510 t CO₂e will remain from landfilling. Due to previously disposed waste in the landfill body, landfill gas with approximately a 50 percent methane content is generated. This gas is a byproduct of the anaerobic decomposition of biodegradable waste deposited in landfill cells. Immediately after the disposal of biodegradable waste, biochemical processes begin in the landfill body, breaking down the organic matter present in the waste. Gas typically begins to form about a year after waste disposal and continues to generate for several decades, with smaller amounts potentially forming fifty years or more after disposal. The formation of landfill gas primarily depends on the composition, age, and quantity of waste deposited in the past. Due to the changed composition of disposed waste in recent years (primarily inert waste being disposed of), the quantities of landfill gas are gradually decreasing. However, emissions are likely to persist for several more decades.

Emissions of refrigerant gases (HFCs), used as substitutes for ODS and included in the IPPU sector, are estimated for mobile air conditioning and transport refrigeration. Since the modernization of the
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

vehicle fleet is planned gradually, emissions from refrigerants will decrease gradually and will not reach zero by 2030.

Livestock farming, especially cattle breeding, accounts for the majority of emissions in the AFOLU sector. The planned measures will reduce emissions to some extent, but due to the presence of livestock farming, it will not be possible to completely achieve decarbonisation.

## 2.3 Module A-3 Systemic Barriers and Opportunities to 2030 Climate Neutrality

This module aims to document the conclusions of a systems and stakeholder mapping aimed at identifying systemic barriers and opportunities. In conjunction with the GHG inventory and the policy baseline analysis in the previous two modules of Part A, the analysis reported here serves as a basis for designing actions that address these barriers or exploit the underutilised opportunities in Part C.

A description of the main systems related to the city's GHG emission domains, e.g., technological/infrastructural, institutional/ regulatory, organisational, financial, political, social and behavioural systems.

### A-3.1: Description of urban systems, systemic barriers, and opportunities

Barriers and opportunities in the systems span across various sectors, highlighting the complexity of their assessment:

#### Technological/Infrastructural Systems

Challenges such as grid capacity and stability, compatibility with existing infrastructure, and the nascent stage of new technologies pose significant barriers (CCU, hydrogen, energy storage). Opportunities lie in investing in smart grid technologies, upgrading infrastructure to support renewable energy sources (RES), and fostering innovation in energy technologies.

#### Institutional/Regulatory Systems

Long coordination processes and bureaucratic hurdles impede efficient energy, transportation, and waste management systems. Streamlining procedures, enhancing permit processes, and developing regulations that support sustainable practices across all sectors are pivotal steps toward overcoming these barriers.

#### Organizational Systems

Legacy infrastructures and organizational resistance to change limit the adoption of advanced systems for energy, transportation, and waste management. Organizational transformation, investment in smart infrastructure, and fostering a culture of innovation within institutions can help to mitigate these challenges.

#### Financial Systems

Limited financial resources and high investment costs restrict the city's ability to transition to sustainable systems. Exploring innovative financing models, leveraging public-private partnerships, and creating revenue streams from recyclable materials are opportunities for financial sustainability.

#### Political Systems

A gap in political support for sustainable transportation and energy initiatives can hinder progress. Advocacy, engaging policymakers, and building consensus for ICT-enabled development are critical to securing the necessary political backing for sustainability goals.

# Social Systems

Public resistance to new technologies and a lack of awareness or motivation for sustainable practices present significant social barriers. Enhancing community engagement, transparent information sharing, and targeted education campaigns can foster a collective move toward sustainability.

# Behavioural Systems

Personal habits and consumer culture that promotes disposability contribute to the city's GHG emissions. Promoting energy efficiency, sustainable consumption, and the use of public transportation through incentives and education are essential for driving behavioural change.

# Monitoring and Data Collection

The CCC will be supplemented by annual reports in the form of annexes. The reports will include an overview of the activities carried out and their impacts. They will be prepared by the Core City Team and will be reviewed by the City's Climate Change Council, which consists of all the key stakeholders from each area (health, energy, mobility, etc.). The report will be discussed by the mayor and the mayor's committee, ensuring a comprehensive review and assessment of the city's progress towards sustainable development. The reports will be made available to the public. The final decision on the measures to be taken lies with the Mayor and the City Council.

From 2024 on, an updated CCC will be uploaded to the CDP/ ICLE approved reporting system by 100 CNSC Mission Platform every two years. Ljubljana is reporting to the CDP/ICLEI since 2017.

Monitoring will, in addition to tracking the specified indicators in Part B. 3 of this AP, also consider the integration and effectiveness of sustainable technologies, regulatory compliance, organizational transformation efforts, financial performance of sustainability initiatives, levels of political support, public engagement, and behaviour change metrics. This comprehensive approach to data collection and analysis will inform the further refinement of Ljubljana's strategies for achieving climate neutrality. Here, it is emphasized that the city will approach this monitoring in the future, and it is not part of the current AP.

The detailed analysis in regard to the main systems related to the city's GHG emission domains e.g., technological/infrastructural, institutional/ regulatory, organisational, financial, political, social and behavioural systems is given in table below.

Stakeholder mapping was conducted as part of the CCC Participatory-Communication Strategy (CCC-PCS), identifying three groups:

|  CRITICAL STAKEHOLDERS  |   |   |   |
|  To assessed critical stakeholders the stakeholder analysis, was made within CCC Participatory-
Communication Strategy (CCC-PCS) (January 2023). The stakeholders were categorized into four
groups based on the significance and power dynamics of each stakeholder group, as well as their
level of interest (please see example below).  |   |   |   |

Critical stakeholders were identified as stakeholders whose involvement, influence, and interests are essential to the success and impact of a project or policy, individually as organisation or as a group.

Critical stakeholders are not only included as a matter of principle; their involvement is essential for the fulfilment of commitments, particularly in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These reductions are to be achieved primarily through the activities of the stakeholders and not directly by the city. It is important to understand that only a limited percentage of emissions can be influenced by the city; the majority depends on the proactive initiatives and measures implemented by these stakeholders:

European Union and Slovenian Government authorities and regulatory bodies: They enforce policies and incentivize the adoption of renewable energy and sustainable transport solutions, directly reducing emissions from key sectors such as energy production and transport. As they develop and enforce regulations that not only guide but mandate sustainable practices, this is particularly important for cities in sectors where the city has limited or no jurisdiction (transit), thereby increasing the impact of sustainable initiatives.
City, state, privately owned companies, and institutions: These players invest in and implement energy-efficient technologies and sustainable practices in the supply chain, significantly reducing industrial emissions and promoting the principles of the circular economy. These companies are the driving force behind innovation and practical application. Their commitment to incorporating sustainable technologies and practices into their operations has a direct, significant impact on reducing the city's greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrating the multiplier effect of sector's initiatives.
Academia and research: Science plays a crucial role. Research, innovation and development of new technologies and materials contribute significantly to reducing emissions and highlight the importance of intellectual and practical contributions to the city's sustainability goals in various sectors, from construction and energy production to human behaviour change and social initiatives.
Citizen: Citizens contribute by adopting a sustainable lifestyle, e.g. using public transport, saving energy, and participating in waste-recycling programmes, which directly reduces emissions in the private and public sectors. The collective action and commitment of citizens, including vulnerable groups, is invaluable. Their participation in sustainable practices and support for urban initiatives creates a domino effect that contributes significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and emphasizes the power of the community as a driver of change.
NGOs: These groups facilitate the implementation of projects, promote sustainable practices in communities and industries, and enforce environmental regulations. They act as a catalyst for change by holding various stakeholders accountable and advocating for sustainable practices. Their role is crucial in ensuring that commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are not only made but also honoured, thereby increasing the impact of collective effort.

The critical stakeholders represent as well-formed groups as: The City Transition Team (CTT), Interested Stakeholder Group (ISG), The Specialized Focus Teams (SFT), The Council for Climate Change City of Ljubljana, City Council. Neighbouring municipalities, international strategic partnerships as Euro cities network, ICLEI Circular Cities, Ellen MacArthur Foundation's CE100, Zero Waste Network.

Ljubljana invited various stakeholders, including experts and NGOs, to form the Interested Stakeholder Group (ISG), broadening the range of input into the city's climate strategy.

In the table below, an example of stakeholder mapping (pattern), the entire analysis is integrated into the CCC Participatory-Communication Strategy (CCC-PCS) (January 2023).

# B-1.2: Description of impact pathways

The table above describes the impact pathways that have been developed for individual groups of measures within the fields of action and all six systemic levers described in the NZC Theory of Change. Further explanations of the individual measures can be found in the following chapters. The table also shows the cumulative impact on emissions reduction, encompassing both direct and indirect positive effects, along with the listed co-benefits.

The main arguments for choosing the relevant impact pathways in the action plan for Ljubljana are aimed at achieving the goal of climate neutrality by 2030. These include ambitious measures in the areas of energy, mobility, waste management, green infrastructure, and nature-based solutions. The selection of these pathways is based on the shortcomings and lack of ambition of current strategies to achieve the targets set, while reflecting the need for a comprehensive approach to achieving climate neutrality.

The scenario for the pathway to the 2030 target includes measures in all the sectors (fields of action) presented above that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving climate neutrality. These include a gradual reduction in direct and indirect emissions, increased energy efficiency, a transition to renewable energy sources and the promotion of sustainable mobility, waste management and environmentally friendly practices in the urban environment.

Figure 20: Presentation of emission reductions and residual emissions by sector in 2030.

The impact pathways are closely linked to the strategic priorities set out in the 2030 climate neutrality target. Key challenges addressed by these pathways include the lack of ambition in existing policies, the need for increased investment and action in individual sectors, and overcoming challenges related to infrastructure adaptations, behavioural change, and the introduction of new technologies.

In the following, impact pathways are presented for each field of action, starting with a description of the current situation through to the effects of the expected measures to achieve reduction in GHG emissions. An overview of the existing strategies is provided for each area of action and compared with the impact pathways required to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.

# ENERGY SYSTEMS

The City of Ljubljana and its public and private sector actors use very different energy systems, which, based on the baseline year 2018, account for  $61.8\%$  of all greenhouse gas emissions in the emissions inventory. Ljubljana has two basic energy supply systems: a district heating system and a natural gas supply system, both of which are operated by Energetika Ljubljana (local district heating and gas supply company).

Today, Energetika Ljubljana supplies more than 120,000 customers, or  $75\%$  of residential buildings in the City of Ljubljana, with district heating and natural gas, aiming to increase this share to  $80\%$  by 2024. The district heating network, which was built in 1966, mainly covers the central part of Ljubljana and supplies over 58,900 residential and over 5,700 commercial customers with hot water for heating and domestic sanitary water. The natural gas pipeline network extends even further to the outskirts of the capital and neighbouring municipalities: Medvode, Dol pri Ljubljani, Dobrova - Polhov Gradec, Škofilica, Brezovica, Ig, Log - Dragomer, Grosuplje. Natural gas for heating, hot water or cooking is supplied to over 60,900 private and over 2,900 commercial users. Together, the two systems comprise over 1,600 kilometres of infrastructure and form one of the largest and most developed and branched energy-efficient supply systems in this part of Europe.

In addition to the current power generation units located within the Energetika Ljubljana facility, several solar and hydropower plants are in operation, both in the public and private sectors. Energy efficiency and energy management are already recognised as important elements of all energy systems in the City of Ljubljana, with investment in system optimisation being encouraged at both local and national level.

The City of Ljubljana will decarbonise its district heating system through the integration of RE technologies (heat pumps, waste heat, solar energy, biomass, and biogas). A cogeneration-based waste-to-energy plant (WtE) connected to Ljubljana's district heating system is also planned. In addition to the centralised district heating system, the installation of two separate smaller district heating systems (4th and 5th generation) in the outskirts of Ljubljana is envisaged. The joint optimisation of the electricity grids and the district heating systems will also lead to a cost reduction in the expansion of the electricity grids, as fewer electrical heating devices will be required that would otherwise be fed into the medium and low-voltage level.

For this purpose, a detailed study on the decarbonization of heating systems in the City of Ljubljana was conducted (Technical Assistance - Preparation of a study on the decarbonization of local production heat sources in the City of Ljubljana, ELES d.o.o, December 2023), which assessed the reduction of emissions through the transition to renewable energy sources and investments in new technologies.

The focus is on new green electricity generation plants, e.g. the installation of biogas and biomass CHP plants (in the central generation plant of Energetika Ljubljana), new rooftop photovoltaic projects (both in the public and private sector) and three small hydropower plants on the Ljubljanica river. The utilisation of waste heat (primarily connected to the district heating network) from industrial plants and the commercial sector will be an important step on the road to sustainability. The production and utilisation of green hydrogen will also become an important element in the energy sector. An increase in electricity consumption is inevitable, so our approach is based on the exclusive use of green electricity, which means that the missing electricity will have to be purchased on the market (with appropriate guarantees of origin) and/or via power purchase agreements (PPAs).

The collected measures in the energy sector will lead to an emission reduction of 1,165,147 t CO₂e/year. In addition, the use of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technology will lead to negative emissions (approx. 394,616 t CO₂e/year) to offset emissions in sectors and activities where it will not be possible to completely reduce all emissions through measures, or in activities where the Citi of Ljubljana does not have control over emissions (e.g., transit traffic on motorways).

## Direct impacts (emission reductions):

Total reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as a synergetic result of the implementation of all planned measures: 1,165,147 t CO₂e/year.

## Indirect impacts (co-benefits):

Reduced energy costs.
Decrease in dependence on fossil fuels.
Improvement of reliability and resilience of the power grid.
Reduction in the impact of industry.
Improved air quality and public health.
New green jobs.
Increased energy security.

The existing strategies in Ljubljana's energy sector are not ambitious enough to achieve the climate neutrality targets by 2030. This is also the main argument in favour of choosing these impact pathways, where the measures are more ambitious and show what needs to be done in the energy sector to achieve climate neutrality. The proposed impact pathways envisage a comprehensive and ambitious set of measures, ranging from the installation of renewable energy systems to the gradual replacement of fossil fuel boilers and the development of a reliable and sustainable electricity grid. These pathways also emphasise community engagement, multi-stakeholder collaboration and innovative policy measures that reflect a proactive approach to overcoming barriers and moving the city towards a carbon-neutral future. The proposed measures represent a significant improvement on current strategies and are in line with the city's vision of sustainable energy, economic development, and environmental responsibility.

The selected impact pathways address short and long-term climate protection priorities through a comprehensive approach. Initially, the focus is on understanding barriers, engaging potential users, and fostering collaborations. The city research carbon capture, tests innovative strategies and improves governance networks. Early actions toward climate neutrality also include improving energy efficiency, utilizing waste heat and renewable energy sources, and promoting the purchases of zero-emission electricity. Efforts also focus on optimizing industrial and heating systems, upgrading public lighting, raising awareness, and fostering collaboration across sectors to achieve sustainability goals.

Late outcomes toward climate neutrality involve expanding district heating with renewables, transitioning to green hydrogen, and decarbonizing gas pipelines. Other efforts include upgrading individual heating systems and replacing fossil fuel boilers, enhancing grid reliability, and promoting sustainable energy use through innovation and consumer participation. Emission reduction through decarbonization of energy sources and a carbon capture pilot project are of central importance. Together, these pathways can effectively address climate priorities.

# MOBILITY &amp; TRANSPORT

The transport sector represents one of the biggest hurdles to decarbonisation. The current national targets, coupled with financial support, lack the necessary ambition to achieve the targets set.

The impact pathways described in the following chapters form the basis for the decarbonisation of the transport sector. Achieving climate neutrality by 2030 depends crucially on the implementation of a broad range of measures covering private transport, freight transport, public transport, and urban and other institutional vehicle fleets. The development and implementation of this plan requires cooperation between the city, organisations and stakeholders and reflects a shared commitment to sustainable and climate-neutral transport.

In the current situation, the transport sector plays a significant role in emissions, accounting for up to 42% of all greenhouse gas emissions. At 69%, private transport in particular is responsible for most of
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

these emissions, while freight transport accounts for a significant 26%. Public passenger transport accounts for 4% of total emissions and rail transport for 1%. Other transport segments account for less than 1% of greenhouse gas emissions overall.

This overview illustrates how the various transport sectors contribute to total greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger transport, in particular private transport, is predominant and plays a decisive role in emissions. As a result, measures will primarily focus on reducing private transport and the transition to alternative energy sources. Measures to reduce private transport in the city include new parking regulations, lower speed limits, emission-free zones for walking and cycling, and the promotion of alternative modes of transport through incentives and infrastructure development. Additionally, community mobility infrastructure will be established, and new Park and Ride facilities will be constructed to encourage the use of public transportation. Efforts are also focussed on reducing private car use through a public electric vehicle sharing scheme.

In December 2023, the company PNZ d.o.o. conducted a traffic study that included an assessment of various scenarios for reducing CO₂e emissions. The study was based on three basic scenarios, each addressing key aspects of urban transportation and transport dynamics:

reducing the resistance to cycling and walking by 20% (improving safety, increasing travel speed...),
improving public passenger transport (with the upgrade of the rail network already underway, we introduced additional lines and increased travel speeds by introducing priority lanes, priority at junctions and the use of larger vehicles)
changing accessibility for private cars (speed reduction to 30 km/h on all streets, more expensive accessibility for private cars, such as +10 minutes for the inner city, +5 minutes for the area inside the motorway ring).

It is equally important to tackle the challenges in freight transport, where greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced. Switching from fossil fuels to environmentally friendly alternatives such as biogas, electricity and hydrogen plays a central role in this reduction. This switch would be a very important step for the freight transport sector, which currently accounts for a significant proportion of total greenhouse gas emissions. By introducing alternative energy sources in freight transport, we will not only reduce emissions, but also contribute to greater energy independence and a reduction in dependence on fossil fuels.

The plan aims to reduce emissions from private transport by 63% and emissions from freight transport by 58% by 2030, with public passenger transport moving towards full decarbonisation. Overall, transport emissions from motor vehicles are to be reduced by 62%. This holistic approach is crucial to successfully achieving sustainable goals and shaping a responsible, environmentally friendly transport system.

One of the most important measures for decarbonising public transport is the transition to alternative and sustainable energy sources and drive technologies. By 2030, all diesel-powered city buses will be replaced by clean, emission-free buses, with 49% of the fleet running on hydrogen or electricity from renewable sources. This switch is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the vehicle fleet by over 50%. Biomethane, a carbon-neutral fuel, will replace natural gas by 2030 and account for 51% of the bus fleet. The strategy aims to decarbonise 100% of the fleet through a combination of fuel decarbonisation and the introduction of zero-emission vehicles.

To reduce GHG emissions, a comprehensive set of measures focusing on increasing the use of public transport is planned. The expansion of public transport includes new lines, increased bus frequencies and dedicated lanes to reduce travel times, and improved traffic management systems, prioritising
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

public transport and carrying 250,000 passengers a day. Improvements to railway infrastructure include double-tracking, electrification, the introduction of three new stations, and an integrated timetable to optimize infrastructure, increase efficiency, and reduce delays for seamless travel. Additionally, the establishment of the Ljubljana Passenger Centre aims to centralize public transportation services and promote sustainable urban mobility. The River Public Transport initiative will electrify river transport with 10 electric vessels, the expansion of infrastructure and network connections, and diversify services with a 12 km circular route along the Ljubljanica river. The introduction of a standardised ticketing system will simplify ticket sales, allowing passengers to use a single ticket for different modes of transport, which will improve the accessibility and user-friendliness of public transport.

## Direct impacts (emission reductions):

Total reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as a synergistic result of the implementation of all planned measures: 531,723 t CO₂e/year.

## Indirect impacts (co-benefits):

Improved public transportation coverage.
Improved user experience of public transport.

Reduced noise in the city.
Improved air quality and public health.
Decreased traffic congestion in the city.
More space for green areas and other uses.
Enhanced quality of life for residents.
Enhanced capacity building.
Facilitation of stakeholder collaboration.
Interdisciplinary approach.

The main arguments in favour of choosing these impact pathways focus on a holistic approach to transforming public transport. Key measures include the optimisation of routes, the procurement of new electric and hydrogen buses, the development of a charging infrastructure and the creation of a modern passenger centre. Other initiatives such as river passenger transport, park-and-ride facilities and improvements for pedestrians and cyclists contribute to sustainable urban mobility. Other priorities include the gradual transition to clean energy sources, updating legislation and funding strategies to ensure successful implementation in a changing policy environment.

The impact pathways differ significantly from the existing transport strategies in the City of Ljubljana. While the current strategies primarily enforce regulations and focus on improving public transport and environmental compliance, the proposed measures introduce a comprehensive approach to transforming urban mobility. The pathways, such as optimising public transport, reducing individual road traffic, decarbonising transport, and improving pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, overcome identified barriers and address opportunities. This shift reflects a commitment to a sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly transport system and goes beyond the scope of current strategies.

The selected impact pathways address both short-term and long-term climate change mitigation priorities in the field of urban sustainability. In the short term, the focus is on optimising public transport, procuring electric and hydrogen buses and securing funding for the transition to clean energy. In the long term, impact pathways include building park-and-ride facilities, improving conditions for pedestrians and cyclists, improving the reliability of rail transport, phasing out fossil fuel vehicles,

introducing stricter parking management, introducing speed limits in the city, and increasing financial support for a sustainable transition to clean energy sources in road transport.

Overall, the impact pathways offer tangible and strategic measures that are fully in line with our city's 2030 climate neutrality commitments and make an important contribution to realising a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transport system.

# WASTE &amp; CIRCULAR ECONOMY

In the city of Ljubljana, waste collection and disposal are managed by the public utility company VOKA SNAGA. In 2018, a total of 152,094 tonnes of waste was collected, 67.7% of which was collected separately. The waste is processed at the Ljubljana Regional Waste Management Centre, which includes a landfill and a collection centre spanning around 40 hectares. Three plants for mechanical-biological waste treatment are used to reduce landfill waste, recover recyclable materials, and produce compost.

After treatment in 2018, 18,169 tonnes of waste were disposed of at the landfill site. The landfill generates landfill gas, around 50% of which consists of methane and is captured to reduce emissions. In 2018, 1,207 tonnes of the captured methane were used to operate a cogeneration unit on landfill gas.

Since the waste treatment plant was commissioned in 2015, all collected municipal waste has been processed, minimising the organic carbon in the landfill, and reducing methane formation. Methane generation estimates were calculated using the IPCC method and converted into CO₂ equivalents. Biogenic CO₂ produced at the landfill is absorbed into organic matter and is not included in the total greenhouse gas emissions.

For the waste sector, the aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on the planned waste management programmes and action plans. The current waste management concept already includes a comprehensive strategy for the sustainable and responsible handling of waste. The focus here is on reducing waste, promoting recycling and efficient waste processing.

Ljubljana's waste management strategy aims to reduce household waste to less than 80kg per inhabitant per year through appropriate measures. With the planned impact pathways, efforts include combating single-use plastics, reducing food waste, and promoting sustainable management of textiles and electronic devices. Initiatives focus on promoting waste reduction, revising regulations, and promoting waste-to-energy projects.

## Direct impacts (emission reductions):

Total reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as a synergetic result of the implementation of all planned measures: 19,990 t CO₂e/year.

## Indirect impacts (co-benefits):

Increased production of renewable energy sources.
Reduced dependence on traditional energy sources.
More efficient resource utilization.
Higher proportion of recycled waste.
Less landfilled waste.

Facilitation of stakeholder collaboration.

Investing in advanced waste-to-energy technologies, improving waste collection infrastructure, introducing separate collection of textiles and co-financing sustainable waste management events are the main arguments in favour of these impact pathways. In addition, financial incentives for circular economy practices, the analysis of waste sorting and the establishment of a rental and repair centres for electronic equipment contribute significantly to the promotion of responsible waste management.

The impact pathways outlined in the public utility's 2022-2027 development strategy are in line with the analysis of the status of climate protection measures. The company's focus on waste recycling, reuse and process optimisation is in line with existing strategies. In addition, the strategy is directly in line with the city's 2030 climate neutrality commitments, as evidenced by initiatives such as the construction of a new non-municipal waste recycling plant, the establishment of a mixed packaging centre and the improvement of waste separation. These measures will remove barriers to climate protection and utilise opportunities to generate green energy.

The planned impact pathways address short-term initiatives, which include the introduction of separate collection systems for textiles and electrical equipment, reduced landfilling of mixed municipal waste to lower methane emissions, improved waste management through online applications and fullness sensors, and promotion of sustainable practices such as refill systems, second-hand stores, and home composting. Long-term impact pathways focus on utilizing waste for district heating, developing new technologies for recycled carbon fuels, expanding collection networks, and establishing zero-waste stores, repair services, and packaging-free sales points. Other measures include incentivizing circular economy practices, implementing deposit systems, and encouraging local food sales and eco-gardens.

In line with our city's 2030 commitments to climate neutrality, the impact pathways strategically support sustainable waste management, improve recycling efficiency, and promote environmentally friendly practices. This alignment reflects our commitment to cultivating a circular and environmentally conscious community and contributes significantly to our overarching climate neutrality goals.

# GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE &amp; NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS

Within the broader framework of green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, we also include the agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) sector. In 2018, 11,488 hectares of forest land (42%) and 6,001 hectares (22%) of agricultural land were in use in the administrative area of the City of Ljubljana. Most of the remaining land consists of urban areas, suburbs, surrounding rural settlements and transport and other infrastructure. These are mostly built-up urban areas, but also include green spaces such as gardens, parks, lawns, sports fields, and other recreational areas. Green spaces make up around a third of the urban area.

Agriculture continues to be an important steward of natural resources and is one of the most important landscapers in suburban areas. In 2020, there were 791 farms in the City of Ljubljana, 62% of which were engaged in livestock farming. In 2018, the farms in the City of Ljubljana together kept 5,051
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

cattle, 578 horses, 559 pigs, 927 sheep and goats and 8,770 heads of poultry. On average, each farm has 7 hectares of agricultural land, and in 2020, 134 farms had an area of more than 10 hectares.

The City of Ljubljana is implementing initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance natural $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sinks. Through the greening plan, urban green spaces are being expanded to $40\%$, utilizing various greening measures such as green roofs and facades, public orchards, and community gardens, sustainable urban forests, and blue-green corridors.

In December 2023, a study was conducted to assess emissions and carbon sinks for the land use sector, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) in the City of Ljubljana. The study was carried out by the Slovenian Forestry Institute.

Additionally, essential water management practices are being employed to improve water retention and filtration, as well as enhance water and air quality, contributing to urban liveability. These measures not only promote the well-being of citizens but also mitigate the urban heat island effect, regulate temperatures, and reduce energy consumption, ultimately resulting in a more sustainable and resilient urban landscape.

In the area of forest management, the city promotes responsible practices among private forest owners to maintain the $42\%$ forest cover. Spatial analyses and protection measures as well as the acquisition of socially valuable forests contribute to the long-term preservation of the carbon sink.

Measures in sustainable agriculture are focussed on local food production as part of the "Green Supply Chain" project. Impact pathways include protecting agricultural land, improving self-sufficiency, and introducing climate-resilient agriculture. Collaboration with landowners aims to increase the number of permanent crops while incentivising sustainable farming practices, including an efficient nitrogen cycle and a breeding programme to reduce methane emissions.

## Direct impacts (emission reductions):

and the long-term urban greening plan reflects the city's commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2030. The selected impact pathways thus effectively contribute to fulfilling the outlined commitments and advancing the city's climate agenda.

# BUILT ENVIRONMENT

In 2022, there were a total of 72,110 buildings in the city of Ljubljana, including 37,050 residential buildings (51%) and 35,060 non-residential buildings (49%).

The data shows that a large proportion of the buildings have non-renewed roofs (65.7%) and facades (83%). Of the residential buildings, 51% have renovated roofs and 26% have renovated facades. Windows were replaced in 15% of all buildings.

Energy-efficient building renovations and other measures related to the efficient use of energy and renewable energy sources are co-financed by Eco Fund through grants and favourable loans. Eco Fund, the Slovenian public environmental fund, is a state organisation that supports initiatives for environmental sustainability, energy efficiency and sustainable practices.

According to Eco Fund, a total of 12,436 investments were made in improving the energy efficiency of buildings and promoting renewable energy sources between 2009 and 2022. The peak year for investments was 2020 with 1,471 recorded projects. The most important areas of investment between 2009 and 2022 include building joinery (3,871), thermal insulation (3,024), gas condensing boilers (1,965), ventilation (1,926) and heat pumps (387). On average, 957 investments co-financed by Eco Fund were made each year.

The current trend in retrofitting is insufficient and emphasises the need for increased investment and retrofitting - a crucial step in driving energy efficiency and achieving the set targets. The average specific heat consumption of buildings in the city of Ljubljana is 122 kWh/m², which indicates a significant potential for savings. Buildings that are energy-inefficient are either comprehensively or partially refurbished. Refurbishment measures include the installation of thermal insulation, the replacement of joinery, the renewal of the heating system and installation of ventilation with heat recovery. Energy renovation of 50% of the heated building stock is envisaged, where feasible. In this case, energy consumption would decrease by 16%, with the average energy figure reduced to approximately 100 kWh/m².

Additionally, it involves the use of eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient construction to achieve passive standards, and prioritizing wood as a sustainable building material. The City of Ljubljana is embracing wooden construction for buildings such as schools, kindergartens, sports halls, etc., where feasible. Furthermore, it will explore options to promote wooden construction in private projects, provide education, and encourage its investors and residents to build wooden houses. One of the goals is also to ensure that the new and renovated infrastructure is resilient to extreme weather events and capable of reducing the negative impacts of climate change on the population in accordance with the concept of "Climate proofing".

In addition to the already mentioned measures, other interventions in the built environment are planned, aimed at improving the quality of life in the city. Areas of friendly traffic, also known as "super blocks", will be established to promote sustainable mobility and reduce traffic congestion. In addition, the emphasis will be on revitalizing courtyards, where accessible, green community spaces will be created, serving as centres of social life and recreation for residents.

The establishment of self-sufficient neighbourhoods will promote a high level of autonomy in the supply of energy, water, and food. Additionally, potential locations for creating new public spaces will be identified, their layout and design planned, and projects implemented for their establishment. The goal
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

is to improve the quality of urban living, provide access to green areas, create social and recreational spaces, and promote public life and activities for residents.

## Direct impacts (emission reductions):

Total reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as a synergistic result of implementing all planned measures: 120,091 t CO₂e/year.

## Indirect impacts (co-benefits):

Improved energy security.
Creation of jobs.
Increased public awareness and capacity building.
Decreasing environmental stressors.
Improved urban aesthetics and functionality.
Enhanced building resilience to climate change.
Reducing traffic routes.
Reducing dependence on individual transportation.
Fostering technological innovation.
Reducing time to market.
Attracting investment.
Facilitation of stakeholder collaboration.

The main arguments in favour of these impact pathways are tackling challenges together, creating business models for energy efficiency, promoting climate-friendly construction, extending policies to NZEB standards, ensuring NZEB compliance in new buildings, renovating existing buildings, providing financial support for sustainable housing, and facilitating thermal renovation. These pathways aim to comprehensively address challenges, promote sustainable practices, and provide financial support for the transition to green building.

The impact pathways are more ambitious compared to existing climate strategies. There is a clear difference between the targets of current strategies, which aim to reduce specific energy consumption in residential buildings by 15%, in public buildings by 40%, and new measures to achieve climate neutrality. The new plans aim to energetically renovate 50% of the building stock, representing a significant advancement compared to the current trend.

The selected impactful measures comprehensively address both short-term and long-term climate protection priorities. In addition to the energy renovation of buildings, sustainable construction and wooden building construction are key pillars of these measures, which will enable a reduction in carbon footprint and increase energy efficiency. Furthermore, construction and renovation are conducted in accordance with the concept of Climate Proofing, which includes measures to increase infrastructure resilience against climate change.

The new initiatives represent an upgrade to existing strategies in the built environment, including spatial planning. The main motive for implementing these measures is to improve the quality of urban living and the environment and to promote sustainable development. With this aim, we will establish areas of friendly traffic, known as "super blocks," which will promote sustainable mobility, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create a more pleasant and safe environment for pedestrians and cyclists. At the same time, the urban landscape will be revitalized by creating accessible, green communal spaces in courtyards, which will serve as centres of social life and recreation and contribute to preserving biodiversity and improving air quality. Additionally, self-sufficient neighbourhoods will be established. The new public spaces that we plan to establish will provide access to green and open
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

areas, promote social connections, and strengthen local communities. Urban planning will also consider microclimate conditions, contributing to the improvement of public health and well-being of residents, and create a sustainable and pleasant living environment for current and future generations.

The impact pathways are in line with our city's wider 2030 climate neutrality commitments and address a range of objectives, such as addressing challenges and scaling up policy measures, at the same time also focusing on priorities such as improved energy efficiency, climate-friendly construction, and spatial planning. These pathways, including specified financial support, serve as a strategic framework to promote and strengthen our city's commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2030.

# 3.2 Module B-2 Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design

Module B-2 "Climate Neutrality Portfolio Design" contains a project description for each action planned in the CCC Action Plan. This includes interventions targeted at creating/enhancing carbon sinks to address residual emissions.

The Climate Portfolio Design includes actions in field of energy systems, mobility &amp; transport, waste &amp; circular economy, green infrastructure &amp; nature-based solutions, built environment, digitalization, engaging and collaborating with stakeholders.

Decarbonisation of district heating system
Waste to energy (WtE) plant
Hydrogen integration in industrial processes
Injection of biomethane into the distribution gas pipeline network
Fossil fuels phase out for individual heating systems | Decarbonisation of heat supply energy sources
The city of Ljubljana will decarbonize its district heating system, which currently provides heat to 60,000 residential buildings (approximately 48% of all buildings). Current energy sources are primarily fossil fuels (brown coal and natural gas - together more than 90% or 1 TWh/year). The plan involves existing infrastructure renovation by integrating RES-based technologies (heat pumps, waste heat, solar energy, biomass, and biogas).

After additional processing of municipal waste, approximately 110,000 tons of fuel are produced, which cannot be recycled but are suitable for energy recovery. Plans are underway to establish a facility for energy recovery of this fuel, which will simultaneously generate heat and electricity.

Industrial processes currently use mainly fossil fuels, mainly natural gas. The availability of green hydrogen will significantly contribute to the decarbonization of various sectors, including energy-intensive industries. It is planned that by 2030, hydrogen will cover up to 15% of the current energy demand based on natural gas in industry.

By 2030, the distribution gas network in Ljubljana will transition to decarbonized operation using green hydrogen (15%), local biomethane, and the purchase of biomethane on the market. Local sources of biomethane, including existing biogas plants, will be directly connected to the gas network,  |

Heating individual buildings outside the distribution gas network relies mainly on heating oils, biomass, LPG, and electricity (611 GWh/year). There is a gradual plan to phase out heating oil nationally by 2027. Heating oil and liquefied petroleum gas will be replaced in the future with wood biomass or electric energy (heat pumps).

Green energy production
City of Ljubljana makes strong focus on production of green energy. The integration of combined heat and power (CHP) systems in industrial and commercial sectors optimizes energy usage by utilizing biogas or biomass, promoting efficient resource utilization, and ensuring grid stability and reliable energy supply, especially during winter months. Roof-top photovoltaic projects (on-going and planned) on various buildings will furthermore increase local production of green electricity. 70 GWh/a of waste heat from different industrial and other processes will be integrated into district heating network. Establishing hydrogen production facilities (electrolysis using green electricity) will be important part of city green energy production and decarbonization strategies. By 2030, approximately 350 GWh/year of gas from renewable sources will be injected into the distribution gas pipeline network. Identified sources of biomethane include existing biogas plants and industrial facilities covered by signed bilateral agreements. Furthermore, construction of three small hydropower plants on the Ljubljanica river will diversify power production portfolio. Missing electricity (not produced from local RES sources) will be purchased on the market (with relevant certificated of origin) and through Power purchase agreements (PPA).  |

**Improving green mobility and managing accessibility** | **Enhancing public transportation**
Various measures will be implemented to significantly improve the overall public transportation system.

This includes the introduction of additional urban public transport lines, increasing departure frequencies, adding bus lanes, smart traffic light management and using longer vehicles. Efforts will also focus on optimizing travel times, ensuring more efficient and punctual passenger transport.

Improvements in railway public transport will be pursued to provide seamless and integrated travel experiences. Additionally, the renovation of the main bus and train station is planned to modernize and enhance the central public transportation hub. The area will be redesigned with new green spaces and safer traffic zones, aligned with the principles of sustainable mobility.

To expand public transportation options in the city centre, a circular route along the Ljubljanica river is planned, offering an alternative and eco-friendly mode of transport.

Furthermore, the introduction of a unified ticketing system for all passengers is envisaged to allow the use of a single ticket for various modes of transportation, promoting easy access and enhancing the attractiveness of public transport. These combined initiatives aim to create a more robust, accessible, and sustainable public transportation system for the community.

|  Action outline | Action name | Decarbonisation of heat supply energy sources  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | Decarbonisation of district heating system: The district heating system in Ljubljana has a peak heating capacity of 1.2 GW, with over 270 km of heat distribution network. It supplies heat to more than 64,500 users (approximately 48% of all buildings). Current energy sources are mainly based on fossil fuels (brown coal and natural gas - together more than 90% or 1 TWh/year). Decarbonization measures for the district heating system include the following investments: (1) Cogeneration units on woody biomass with an input power of 2x90 MW. (2) Water-to-water heat pumps with a power of 2x20 MW (utilizing the Ljubljanica river as an energy source, electricity from local renewable sources and/or purchased green electricity with certificates). (3) Solar field with solar energy receivers and a seasonal heat storage system with a water-to-water heat pump with a power of 20 MW. (4) Waste-to-energy (WtE) facility with an input heat capacity of approximately 55 MW (more detailed description in the following measure). (5) Combined heat and power units on natural gas or biogas 2x59 MW (the investment has already been completed and is not addressed within this action plan).
The measures are in the pre-planning phase, locations are defined, and implementation is planned by 2030. Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technology for capturing and re-using biogenic CO2 emissions is also envisaged for cogeneration units on wood biomass, biogas, and waste-to-energy plant (see also action “Negative emissions”).
In addition to Ljubljana’s main district heating system two new smaller destring heating system will be built (Gameljne – wood biomass, 5 MW, 15 GWh/a and Šmartno-Sneberje – water-to-water heat pump due to its close proximity to the Sava River, 5 MW, 1.9 MWel, 15 GWh/a), using 4th or 5th generation of district heating systems technologies.

|   | waste-derived fuel are generated annually, which cannot be further materially utilized or recycled but is suitable for energy recovery - for heat and electricity production. Currently, this fuel is transported out of Ljubljana. With the aim of closing the material flow of waste management at the municipal level, reducing the carbon footprint, and increasing energy self-sufficiency, we plan to establish a facility for energy recovery from municipal waste, simultaneously producing heat and electricity. The facility will be built using best available techniques (BAT), with high energy efficiency (more than 80%) and in compliance with all strictest environmental and health protection standards. For the energy utilization of fuel from municipal waste, which is currently obtained at RCERO Ljubljana, a facility with a size of 55 megawatts of input thermal power would be needed. With this, we could generate around 225 gigawatt-hours of heat and 65 gigawatt-hours of electricity from this amount of fuel. In the case of a wider contribution area (RCERO and neighbouring regional centres), this would mean 140,000 tons of fuel and therefore a facility with a total thermal power of 73 megawatts, which would produce approximately 373 gigawatt-hours of heat and 80 gigawatt-hours of electricity. The energy recovery of waste is a mandatory state economic public service – state public service can be performed through concession assignment. Hydrogen integration in industrial processes: Industrial processes currently rely primarily on fossil fuels (natural gas). When green hydrogen becomes available, it will have a positive impact on decarbonizing various sectors, including energy-intensive industries. It is planned that by 2030, hydrogen will cover up to 15% of the current energy demand based on the use of natural gas in industry. Injection of biomethane into the distribution gas pipeline network: The distribution gas pipeline network will be decarbonized by 2030 using green hydrogen (15% injected into the transmission gas network, without requiring significant technological upgrades), locally injected biomethane, and purchases of biomethane on the market.  |

Decarbonization of the distribution gas pipeline network through the injection of green hydrogen and locally produced biomethane.
Gradual replacement of boilers with fossil fuels in individual heating systems.  |

Local sources of biomethane production will be directly connected to the gas distribution network via newly built entry points. Potential sources of biomethane include existing biogas plants, which will be upgraded with purification facilities to convert biogas into biomethane, and industrial facilities where biogas is produced as a byproduct. The introduction of biomethane is planned gradually.

The public company Energetika Ljubljana is also in negotiations with other potential suppliers from Slovenia for additional quantities of biomethane, while a smaller portion would be purchased on the European market (gradually by 2030). By 2030, it will be necessary to provide 1013 GWh/year of biogas sources for heating, industrial processes, and transportation purposes, with the aim of completely replacing natural gas.

Fossil fuels phase out for individual heating systems:
Heating systems for individual buildings (i.e., those outside the district heating network and gas distribution network) mainly use light fuel oil (heating oil), biomass, LPG, and electricity (totalling 611 GWh/year, with both light fuel oil and LPG accounting for 50%). Light fuel oil will be gradually phased out by 2027 at the national level. Heating oil and LPG will be replaced in the future by wood biomass (321 GWh/year) and electricity for heat pumps (141 GWh/year). By 2030, fossil fuels for individual heating systems will be phased out, eliminating the current import dependency on fossil fuels.

The industry in the City of Ljubljana will generate 10% of its own electricity consumption through solar power plants on the roofs of industrial facilities, totalling 48 GWh per year.

**Waste heat utilisation:**

The district heating network's optimisation through the harnessing of waste heat reservoirs represents a significant advancement in sustainable energy utilization. The untapped potential of waste heat, often overlooked and dissipated into the environment, emerges as a prime resource for bolstering the district heating system. By prioritizing the incorporation of this abundant but currently underutilised energy source, the initiative aims to minimise reliance on traditional fuel-based heat production methods. Waste heat usage represents a significant advancement in sustainable energy utilisation. The estimation of using approximately 70 GWh (by 2030) of recoverable waste heat from industries and commercial sectors not only enhances the overall efficiency of the district heating network but also aligns with environmentally conscious practices by reducing unnecessary thermal discharges into the surroundings. The integration of waste heat into the district heating system serves as circular and eco-friendly approach to energy management in the city heating system. This concerted effort not only optimises energy utilisation but also fortifies the district heating network as a model of sustainable urban infrastructure, significantly contributing to the city's environmental and energy independence.

**Hydrogen production:**

The construction of hydrogen production facilities is crucial for advanced clean energy solutions. This includes the introduction of technologies based on electrolysis (using green electricity). Introducing small-scale projects in the testing phase (by 2030) is essential for assessing the feasibility of large-scale hydrogen production and for integrating hydrogen into the existing energy framework. Pilot projects will serve as practical test sites for evaluating the technical and economic feasibility as well as the environmental aspects of hydrogen deployment. Promoting strategic partnerships between industrial, research, and government sectors is crucial for knowledge exchange, technological advancement, and resource allocation optimization. Collaboration will accelerate innovation in hydrogen production processes.

|   |  | Biogas production: Biogas sources include agricultural, household, municipal waste, as well as waste from the food, agricultural and forestry industries, wastewater treatment plants, plant residue and waste biomass from industry. Biogas sources are important for sustainable energy supply at the local level, as they reduce the need for fossil fuels. By 2030, approximately 350 GWh/year of gas produced locally from renewable sources will be injected into the distribution gas pipeline network. Identified (local) sources of biomethane include existing biogas plants (including those with capacities for cleaning biogas to biomethane stage) and industrial facilities where biogas is produced as a by-product (some bilateral agreements have already been signed). Hydropower production: It is planned to install (ongoing project activities, construction will begin in 2026) three small hydropower plants (locations: 1-Ambrožev trg, 2-Gruberjev prekop, 3-Sotočje), with a total power capacity of 1.6 MWe on the Ljubljanica river with production of 7 GWh/a. In addition to environmentally friendly electricity production, project would also enable added value in revitalization of the coastal area of Ljubljanica and Grubarjev kanal, thus encourage tourism, river traffic (a closed waterway around Grajski grič) and increased flood safety. Purchase of carbon-free electricity: The remaining electricity consumption not produced by local sources in the City of Ljubljana (solar, hydro, waste-to-energy, cogeneration on biogas/biomass) will be obtained from the market or through power purchase agreements. Only renewable or nuclear electricity with origin certificates will be used. The purchase of zero-emission electricity is planned in a total quantity of approximately 1,533 GWh (all remaining electricity consumed in the public sector, public transport, industry, and business sector, as well as 65% of household electricity consumption). As part of decarbonizing the district heating system, heat pumps represent an important source of thermal energy. To achieve emission reduction targets, the electricity used to power heat pumps must be obtained from renewable sources. Although we strive for energy self-  |

|   |  Action description | Power system flexibility: With the increasing share of renewable energy sources, the transition to improving the flexibility of the power system is crucial. Flexibility within the system entails the ability to dynamically adjust the production and/or consumption of electricity and heat. By integrating planned measures and collaborating with relevant stakeholders (grid operators, energy producers, and consumers), the power system gains agility and resilience necessary for effectively balancing the dynamics of supply and demand, thereby addressing potential disruptions arising from the potential volatility of renewable energy sources. The flexibility of the power system involves various technical and operational strategies/solutions, such as: (1) advanced energy storage systems, (2) innovative technologies for grid management, (3) development of demand-side management solutions. Energy storage: The implementation of energy storage solutions stands as a pivotal strategy in fortifying grid reliability and fostering the seamless integration of renewable energy sources. Deploying cutting-edge technologies, such as battery storage systems or other advanced storage solutions, plays a crucial role in optimising the energy balance within the grid. Storage systems will serve as reservoirs for capturing surplus energy generated during periods of low demand or high renewable energy output. Subsequently, this stored energy can be efficiently discharged during peak demand times or when renewable sources encounter intermittency, ensuring a continuous and stable supply of electricity. In addition, the versatility of energy storage technologies will contribute to grid stability by providing rapid response capabilities to fluctuations in energy generation, thereby mitigating potential disruptions caused by variability in renewable sources, especially for solar power.

devices in the city is 43,066 (53,235 measuring devices and 55,407 consumption points), with an average age of 26 years. Of these, 18,661 are older than 20 years. To improve outdoor air quality, especially during winter, and increase energy efficiency, all heating devices older than 20 years need to be replaced.

**Reduction of heat losses in district heating system:**

The district heating system of Ljubljana spans mostly over the central part of Ljubljana, supplying hot water for heating and preparing sanitary hot water to over 58,900 residential and over 5,700 commercial customers. While significant part of district heating network of Ljubljana is over 30 years old, current average thermal losses of the network system are around 14% (seasonal average). Reducing thermal losses in the network is a crucial measure for increasing overall energy efficiency of district heating system. This involves ongoing optimization of network operation, expansion of the low-pressure part of the district heating network, improvement of the insulation of pipelines and distribution systems, thereby minimising heat losses during heat transfer.

**Energy efficiency in the industry sector:**

The aim of the measure is to improve energy efficiency by upgrading and optimizing industrial energy systems, namely with the following actions: (1) implementing advanced HVAC solutions with intelligent management, (2) introducing energy-efficient drives, (3) improving thermal insulation, (4) CHP plants, (5) introducing low-temperature technologies and processes. For energy-efficient industrial technologies and practices, we estimate annual savings of 0.5% for electricity and 0.25% for heating. Due to the increased use of low-temperature applications, we estimate annual savings of 3% for processes using gaseous fuels and 1% for processes related to district heating networks (steam and/or hot water). With the efficient use of energy-efficient HVAC systems, we estimate annual energy savings of approximately 1%.

Energy management involves oversight and strategic control over energy resources and operations, aimed at maximising efficiency and fostering sustainable energy utilisation. This encompassing approach comprises a spectrum of actions and tools, ranging from monitoring and analysis of energy consumption patterns to conducting thorough energy audits. It also involves setting ambitious targets for optimising energy use, implementing tailored measures to curtail consumption, and assessing the outcomes  |

|   | achieved. The outlined measures are projected for implementation across diverse sectors, notably in commercial buildings and facilities, institutional infrastructures, and within the manufacturing and construction industries. These sectors stand as important areas where energy efficiency can be realised through the application of targeted energy management strategies. In projecting the impact of these measures, we estimate conservatively a saving of 0,5% across all energy sources. Organizations, municipalities, and institutions may also choose to certify their operations, for example, with ISO 50001. In accordance with the proposed Energy Efficiency Directive, member states will be required to ensure that companies whose average annual consumption over the last three years exceeds 85 TJ considering all energy sources, implement an energy management system. It will also be required that companies establish an energy management system no later than October 11, 2027. For companies with an average annual consumption exceeding 10 TJ over the last three years and not using an energy management system, an energy audit will be required. An energy audit (for example as per ISO 50002), is a systematic process used to evaluate an organisation's (or building's) energy use and consumption patterns. It's a valuable tool for organisations systematically seeking to reduce energy consumption, lower costs, and enhance their overall sustainability efforts. Energy audit typically involves: (1) planning and preparation, (2) data collection and analysis, (3) on-site inspections and measurements, (4) identifying energy saving opportunities, (5) evaluation and recommendations, (6) follow-up and monitoring. It is assumed that the cumulative annual effect of performing energy audits is 1% of electricity savings and 0.5% of heating energy savings. An energy audit is the initial and essential step in implementing measures for efficient energy use. Active consumer of thermal and electrical energy: The goal of the measure is to enable active participation of heat and electricity consumers through collective action via aggregators in schemes that consider their energy production, consumption, storage, or energy sales. Additionally, the introduction of a dynamic tariff system will alter the behaviour of individual  |

|   |  | consumers, e.g., a bonus/penalty system within the tariff structure will incentivize consumers to adopt lower temperature regimes and use energy-efficient equipment. Thus, becoming an "active consumer" will be a strong emphasis of the energy policy of the City of Ljubljana. Under appropriate circumstances, the transition to a climate-neutral energy system will enable many more consumers to actively engage in the energy system by managing their own energy demand, production, and consumption. Active participation in the market can reduce one's carbon footprint and, in many cases, energy costs as well. The more active role of consumers, especially in cooperative models, could also bring significant social benefits. Within the measure, active participation of heat and electricity consumers through aggregators in schemes that consider their energy production, consumption, storage, or energy sales is planned.  |

|   |  Comments on implementation – consider mentioning resources, timelines, milestones | Although interactive workshops and events to raise awareness about the importance of energy efficiency are already underway, it is essential to increase financial resources for the expansion of educational programs. This would encourage greater investment in energy efficiency measures and renewable energy sources.

The energy consulting office has been operating for some time, but it is facing the problem of low attendance. Therefore, it is crucial to increase promotion and inform the public about the offered consultancy in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. Funds are provided annually by the state, but additional funds can also be contributed by the City of Ljubljana.

Funds are allocated for energy-poor households every year, but their amount is limited. To achieve the set goals, it is essential to increase these funds so that more households can apply.

In the future, it will be essential to increase funds for worker training and allocate more financial resources for the development of new technologies and business models. Due to the competitiveness of companies, they already invest heavily in education.  |

|   |  Action description | Enhancing urban public bus transportation: Improvement measures for urban public bus transportation include several steps: (1) Introduction of new routes - new tangential lines such as Šiška-Bežigrad-BTC (along the northern ring corridor), Vič-Šiška, Vič-Rudnik, and Šiška-Bežigrad (along the Drenikova and Topniška corridors). (2) Increasing bus frequency on main routes - during peak hours, the frequency of departures will be 5 minutes or less on all main roads (Dunajska, Celovška, Tržaška, Barjanska, Dolenjska, Zaloška, and Šmartinska). (3) Implementation of additional dedicated bus lanes between the new Ljubljana Passenger Center and the ring on major corridors (Dunajska, Celovška, Tržaška, Barjanska, Zaloška, Šmartinska, and Dolenjska), which will improve travel times by 20%. (4) Smart traffic light management system prioritizing public transportation vehicles at intersections. (5) Introduction of longer vehicles to accommodate more passengers (currently not regulated by law, expected to be addressed in the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of the Republic of Slovenia). (6) The option to board through all doors, which will enable shorter stops at stations. (7) Adjustment of bus schedules and timetables for better integration with intercity buses and trains. (8) Conducting comprehensive and individual studies to ensure compliance with public transportation planning, such as introducing new routes, road reconstruction for specific measures, and as a whole. These efforts aim to increase the mileage of urban passenger vehicles by up to 50%, focusing on route rationalization and fleet optimization, resulting in a daily increase in transported passengers to 250,000. The overall goal is to make public transportation more attractive and reduce travel time for passengers.
Improving railway public transport: The development of railway infrastructure is the responsibility of the state, which in recent years has been intensively renovating and upgrading railway lines throughout Slovenia. State plans for the railway hub in the Ljubljana area include the introduction of double tracking and electrification on all existing railway connections between Ljubljana and other regional centres. These measures aim to  |

|   | increase the speed of passenger trains, optimize traffic, and reduce delays. Additionally, the introduction of an integrated timetable is envisaged, based on precise schedules of train arrivals and departures at individual stations. By adding three new stations to the existing railway infrastructure, the concept of light rail will be incorporated, offering improved accessibility, and facilitating travel within the city. These stations will be carefully selected and organized to ensure seamless transfers between different forms of public transport and other modes of mobility. The main goal of coordinated railway transportation in the future is to optimize the use of infrastructure, increase timetable accuracy, and enhance the efficiency and reliability of railway transportation.  |
| --- | --- |
|  **Renovation of the main bus and train station:**
In the heart of Ljubljana, the Ljubljana Passenger Centre (PCL) will be established as the central hub for passengers using public transportation (the investment is expected to be completed by the end of 2025). The broader area around the main bus and train stations will undergo a complete transformation, with new green spaces and safer traffic zones. The project is fully aligned with the guidelines of sustainable urban mobility, with all road expansions and new configurations designed exclusively for public transit (no roads will be widened for personal vehicles). Plans prioritize cyclists and pedestrians, incorporating new areas to enhance safety for all traffic participants and additional greening of spaces, including tree-lined streets and squares in the surrounding area.  |   |
|  **Establishment of river public transport:**
To diversify public transport options within the wider city centre, the project includes the establishment of a circular route along the Ljubljanica river. This initiative includes measures to electrify river transport, such as procuring 10 dedicated electric vessels for public transport, developing river infrastructure, and implementing grid connections, electric charging infrastructure (120 kW), and battery storage solutions. The circular route around the city centre area will be approximately 12 km long.  |   |

|   |  Action type | Physical/spatial interventions, other interventions  |
|   |  Action description | Managing city accessibility for personal vehicles:
The main objective of the measure is to create conditions for less attractive access to the city by personal vehicles, by calming the flow of cars in the city centre and in the areas outside the ring road, thereby reducing congestion and encouraging the use of public transport (reducing accessibility for private traffic in the city centre by 10 minutes, and by 5 minutes in areas outside the ring road). The measures will be implemented after improving public transportation services to ensure a fair transition. The following activities are planned:
(1) Introduction and implementation of a new parking policy for personal vehicles in the city centre (higher parking fees, shorter parking times in zone 1, resident permits). (2) Implementation of a 30 km/h speed limit on most non-main city streets. (3) Establishment of new emission-free zones, allowing only walking and cycling. (4) New restricted traffic areas. (5) Carpool lanes, where vehicles with more than three occupants can use lanes designated for public transportation. (6) Development of a city logistics management plan to optimize freight transport.

Establishing community mobility infrastructure:
Establishing community mobility infrastructure involves the development and implementation of transportation solutions focused on community needs and integration. This approach to mobility not only enhances transportation connections and accessibility but also strengthens community spirit and collaboration, contributing to a more sustainable and connected urban environment. The measure includes the following activities:
(1) Establishing and managing a public system for renting and sharing electric vehicles and bicycles. (2) Establishing shared mobility hubs. (3) Setting up passenger transfer points (public  |

|   |  | transport hubs, bike storage facilities at Park and Ride stations, bike, and scooter rental, etc.). (4) Implementing mobility plans for institutions. (5) Establishing models for vehicle, technology, and infrastructure sharing and co-use.

**New Park and Ride (P+R) areas and Park + Sail:**
The "Green Move Ljubljana" project aims to reduce congestion in the city by constructing two new Park and Ride (P+R) facilities, providing parking for up to 800 vehicles. This encourages daily commuters to use public transportation, thus reducing the number of cars in the city centre. The P+R facilities will also be connected to new river public transportation stations, from where it will be possible to travel to the city centre using river e-vessels (the so-called "Park + Sail" concept).

**Development of alternatives and innovations for better accessibility:**
To improve accessibility for all, including persons with disabilities, we will continue to strive to develop services that will facilitate easier and more comfortable sustainable travel over longer distances. This includes the development of on-demand transportation services in various forms and the expansion or enhancement of the transport service for mobility-impaired individuals, known as "Kavalir".  |

|  Action outline | Action name | Decarbonisation of road and other motor vehicles  |
|   |  Action type | Technical interventions  |
|   |  Action description | Modernisation and decarbonization of urban and suburban public bus transportation:
By 2030, the replacement of all city buses currently running on diesel fuel with clean and zero-emission vehicles is planned. It is expected that by 2030, 49% of the city bus fleet will operate on hydrogen or electricity generated from renewable energy sources. This measure will contribute to reducing CO2e emissions in the entire fleet by over 50%.  |
|   |   |  At the same time, by 2030, the replacement of the currently predominant compressed natural gas (a fossil fuel) with biomethane, which is a carbon-neutral fuel, is anticipated. According to the strategy, buses operating on biomethane are expected to represent 51% of the fleet by 2030.  |
|   |   |  With the combination of transitioning from natural gas to biomethane and the introduction of zero-emission vehicles, the complete decarbonization of the fleet is envisioned.  |
|   |   |  Decarbonization of vehicles owned by the City of Ljubljana, public institutions, and public companies:
The measure involves the modernization and decarbonization of the fleet of the city administration, public companies, and institutions. The plan includes upgrading the existing fleet with environmentally friendly vehicles. Implementation of the measure entails transitioning to electricity for personal, light-duty, and medium-duty vehicles, as well as using biomethane for heavy-duty vehicles (e.g., garbage trucks).  |
|   |   |  Charging infrastructure for electric and hydrogen vehicles:  |
|   |   |  |
|   |   |  |
|   |  |   |
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   | The measure encompasses the installation of charging stations and centres for electric vehicles, as well as the establishment of charging infrastructure for electric and hydrogen-powered public transportation vehicles.

The plan includes the deployment of numerous new charging stations for personal and commercial vehicles with charging power up to 22 kW at existing parking areas, along with high-power charging centres for fast charging (150 and 350 kW). These charging stations will be set up in collaboration with existing charging infrastructure providers.

Additionally, a network of electric charging stations for buses with a capacity of 75 kW (charging station 150 kW) will be established. The charging stations are designed to efficiently recharge buses with a daily consumption of up to 390 kWh within a limited time frame.

Furthermore, the installation of a hydrogen refuelling station is planned to provide hydrogen at pressure levels of 350 bar and 700 bar (for light-duty vehicles) for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The station will supply public transportation buses as well as other personal and commercial vehicles. Green hydrogen production will be enabled by using electricity from small hydropower plants along the Ljubljanica river and solar power, aligning with the environmentally friendly "Hydrogen Valley" project.

The charging infrastructure will be primarily designed to support the efficient operation of battery electric buses (BEB) and fuel cell electric buses (FCEB).

**Decarbonisation of passenger cars:**
To achieve the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and beyond, radical changes in the fuel structure of personal vehicles are necessary, in addition to reducing the use of personal cars. It is crucial that personal vehicles transition to sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives.

Electricity is expected to play a key role, with the aim of having at least 35% of kilometres travelled by personal vehicles powered by electricity, while hydrogen is projected to cover 10%. Hybrid vehicles will contribute 10% of kilometres travelled, as will biomethane. Vehicles running on diesel and gasoline together will account for the remaining 35% of  |
| --- | --- |

7
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   | all kilometres travelled by personal vehicles in the Ljubljana area.

The transition to sustainable fuels must be carried out at a broader national level, as municipalities have no direct influence on transit traffic. To promote this transformation, it is crucial for national and regional authorities to implement effective strategies that offer incentives and subsidies. National initiatives, including financial incentives for transitioning to zero-emission energy sources in transportation, as well as the construction of infrastructure for charging electric vehicles, hydrogen, and biomethane, will play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and shaping a more environmentally friendly personal transportation system.

**Decarbonisation of freight vehicles and buses:**
To achieve the set goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a significant shift in the fuel composition for light commercial vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, and buses is also important. In the next decade, both freight and passenger transport must transition to sustainable alternatives.

The goal by 2030 is to have at least 25% of kilometres travelled by light commercial vehicles based on electricity, while hydrogen is expected to cover 10%. As the transition will be gradual, diesel fuels will continue to play an important role, covering 40% of kilometres travelled, while gasoline will contribute around 1%. The remaining kilometres travelled are expected to be covered by biomethane (24%).

For heavy-duty vehicles, diesel fuel is expected to maintain dominance (40%), but biomethane is crucial for transitioning to renewable sources, as it could cover 35% of kilometres travelled, while electricity and hydrogen are projected to represent 25%.

In the case of buses, diesel fuel is expected to maintain the largest share (40%), while biomethane could lead the transition to renewable energy sources with 30% of kilometres travelled. Electricity and hydrogen together are expected to contribute 30%.

Transitioning solely to alternative energy sources in road transport can effectively contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving the goals of sustainable (carbon-neutral) mobility.  |

|   |  | Decarbonisation of agricultural machinery: The measure focuses on reducing the consumption of fossil fuels in agriculture. It includes the use of alternative energy sources, such as biomethane or electricity, to power agricultural vehicles, tractors, combines, and other agricultural machinery. The goal of the measure is to replace at least 1/3 of the current diesel fuel consumption with alternative sources. Implementing this measure requires financial support mechanisms, raising awareness among farmers about the benefits of using renewable energy sources, and infrastructure measures for charging or supplying these energy sources.  |

|   |  | constitute a comprehensive approach to efficient and sustainable energy utilization from waste.

**Exceeding 75% of separately collected waste and reaching 80% by 2035:**
To achieve the goals of separate waste collection, which means 75% of waste separated by 2030 and 80% by 2035, an upgrade of the existing infrastructure for separate collection of municipal waste is necessary. This enables users to properly separate waste. Through various communication tools, we target different groups, with an emphasis on proper waste management. This creates conditions for the effective implementation of separate waste collection and the achievement of set goals. The measure includes the following activities: (1) Construction of 3 collection centres with reuse centres. (2) Establishment of an expanded collection network for collecting waste textiles, waste cooking oil, and small household electrical appliances (150 locations). (3) Establishment of a network of 9 mini collection centres. (4) Special collections of waste electrical and electronic equipment in individual neighbourhood communities once a year. (5) Promotion of home composting. (6) Providing a concept for managing small quantities of construction waste, mainly from the renovation of individual housing units (collection point, separate collection at the source, and processing). (7) Waste separation analysis. This analysis is crucial for understanding the types of waste generated in a specific area or institution and enables the planning of appropriate waste management, recycling, and reducing environmental impacts strategies.  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  Action outline | Action name | Green and blue-green infrastructure  |
|   |  Action type | Physical/spatial interventions, nature-based solutions  |
|   |  Action description | Greening of the city: The City of Ljubljana is one of the greenest cities in the EU, which was recognised in 2016 by the European Green Capital Award. The share of total green infrastructure within the city borders is 67% and the share of urban tree cover is 50%, according to data from the Green infrastructure dashboard (EEA, 2021). However, if forests and agricultural land are excluded, the proportion of green space in urban areas (i.e. built-up and related land) is estimated at 33.8%. The aim of this measure is to develop a Long-term Urban Greening Plan to increase the proportion of green spaces to 40% over the next 15 years. Following the guidelines for cities (EC, 2021), the City of Ljubljana will set up an appropriate working structure, develop long-term objectives, set targets, priorities, and timetables, and establish an MRE system. The Long-term Urban Greening Plan for greening the city and managing green areas will include numerous measures and activities: (1) Greening new and existing flat roofs. (2) Establishment of green vertical ecosystems. (3) Implementation of rainwater harvesting, storage, and utilization systems for water recycling within buildings or their surroundings. (4) Conversion of paved (impermeable) surfaces into permeable green surfaces. (5) Establishment of new urban parks and green areas. (6) Creation of new public orchards and community urban gardens. (7) Greening of mobility corridors. (8) Activation and greening of courtyards and atriums. (9) Implementation of the concept of Ljubljana as a sponge city, which functions like a sponge, absorbing and retaining water during rainfall and storms, and releasing it gradually. (10) Establishment of rain gardens. (11) Greening of existing and new parking areas. (12) Establishment of  |

control over private parking lots, which emerge in former courtyards and transition from temporary to permanent use. (13) Conducting a study on the social functions of green areas and people's needs (cityscape). (14) Installation of new drinking fountains and fountains in public spaces and recreational areas. The listed measures will contribute to increasing green areas in urban environments, helping to mitigate the effects of urban heat islands and climate change, and increasing human well-being.

As part of the Long-term Urban Greening Plan, the green roof and facade strategy will be prepared to significantly increase the green roof area in Ljubljana by 2035. Green roofs and facades enhance energy efficiency by providing natural insulation, reducing heating and cooling costs. These green installations also mitigate urban heat island effects, creating a more comfortable and sustainable urban environment. Furthermore, they contribute to improved air quality by capturing pollutants and fostering biodiversity, promoting a healthier and greener living space. Additionally, green roofs and facades help manage stormwater runoff, reducing the risk of flooding and enhancing overall water management in urban areas.

The greening plan will be connected and coordinated with sustainable mobility measures, as it will involve greening mobility corridors and parking areas. Establishing green corridors involves developing dedicated paths for cyclists and pedestrians, separated from motorized traffic, and surrounded by greenery. These corridors enable safe and pleasant mobility while also contributing to reducing traffic noise and improving air quality in cities. Green corridors promote sustainable mobility, such as cycling and walking, and contribute to a greener and healthier urban environment.

The number of parking spaces in the City of Ljubljana will not increase. Measures will focus on reducing above-ground parking areas by arranging underground parking lots (redirecting parking capacities underground), thus freeing up surface space for other purposes such as squares, green areas, parks, pedestrian paths, or bicycle lanes. This reduces visual pollution in urban spaces, improves environmental quality, and promotes sustainable land use and mobility.

|   | An analysis of the social functions of green areas and people's needs for urban landscapes (cityscape) will also be conducted to identify the impact of the urban environment on the well-being of residents and the social dynamics of the city. The analysis of the social functions of green areas focuses on understanding how parks, gardens, and other green areas contribute to the quality of life, social interaction, and community health. On the other hand, exploring people's needs for urban landscapes involves analysing how various elements of the urban environment, including green spaces, influence residents' perception, use, and satisfaction with urban space. Both approaches are crucial for planning that considers the human dimension of the city and promotes sustainable urban development. **Sustainable water management:** The measure of sustainable water management includes the following activities: (1) Flood prevention infrastructure aimed at preventing floods in populated areas and agricultural lands. (2) Water flow regulations. (3) Habitat restoration. (4) Sediment removal. (5) Barrier installation. (6) Conducting a study and developing solutions for locations in the city prone to waterlogging during heavy rainfall. (7) Planning SuDS systems (Sustainable Drainage Systems). (8) Hydrological-hydraulic studies with a hydraulic-hydrological model of flood events. Comprehensive river system management will be introduced, which includes regulating water flow, habitat restoration, sediment removal, and the installation of barriers to ensure a balance between human needs and ecosystem preservation. The goal is to prevent floods, ensure water resources, maintain biodiversity, and support socio-economic activities along the river. A study will be conducted to identify locations in the city where water stagnation occurs during heavy rainfall, with the aim of establishing Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS). SuDS are drainage solutions that provide an alternative to the direct channelling of surface water through networks of pipes and sewers to nearby watercourses. The aim of SuDS is to reduce direct runoff from urban areas, thereby reducing the risk of flooding. This is achieved by retaining and storing water, slowing its flow, and increasing infiltration into the soil. SuDS systems include various elements such as green roofs, retention ponds,  |

|   |  | gravel trenches, and other permeable surfaces that absorb, filter, and retain water.

Hydrological and hydraulic studies will also be conducted using flood event models to reduce the area's vulnerability to climate change, including longer drought periods and extreme rainfall. The studies will involve rainfall simulation, flow analysis, and an assessment of the hydrological and hydraulic conditions in all watersheds of the “Tivoli, Rožnik, and Šišenski hrib” Landscape Park. The task will be used to identify measures for developing blue-green infrastructure in the climate change adaptation process and to design conceptual plans for these measures based on an assessment of necessity.  |

|   |  Action description | Protecting agricultural land and increasing local self-sufficiency:
Ensuring sustainable and coordinated spatial development and protecting agricultural land are crucial for producing high-quality food and achieving a higher level of self-sufficiency. The activities of this measure include (1) preparing expert bases for determining permanently protected agricultural land and (2) developing guidelines for transitioning to climate-adapted agriculture with the aim of improving food quality and self-sufficiency.

The objective of the measure is to designate areas of permanently protected agricultural land and increase the areas of agricultural land adapted to climate change. Within the measure, plans are in place for (3) increasing the area of permanently protected arable land by at least 5 hectares, (4) expanding the area of orchards with anti-hail nets by at least 2 hectares, and (5) increasing the area of irrigation systems by 35 hectares.

Self-sufficiency and reducing the length of supply chains will be supported by promoting local vegetable production, with an emphasis on encouraging organic farming. To ensure sustainability and supply stability, (6) long-term contracts will be concluded with producers for the supply of organic produce, available for direct purchase at farms.

Conservation and restoration of hedges and riparian buffer strips:
Hedgerows and riparian buffer strips are important landscape elements that contribute to carbon sequestration, biodiversity, soil erosion reduction, and water quality  |

The activities of the measure include: (1) Encouraging landowners to restore hedgerows and riparian strips in the Ljubljana Marshes, which fall under the Natura 2000 area in the City of Ljubljana, with financing from agri-environmental and climate measures (measure "Preservation of Hedgerows"). (2) Removal of invasive species along the Ljubljanica river (e.g., Japanese knotweed) and replanting 10,000 native shrubs and tree saplings (e.g., willow).

**Increasing the area of permanent crops:** There are currently around 200 hectares of permanent crops in the City of Ljubljana, which is relatively little in terms of the local fruit supply. In cooperation with the landowners, we will examine the possibilities of increasing the area of permanent crops, e.g. extensive and intensive fruit orchards. For this purpose, an expert basis for the expansion possibilities of permanent orchards will be prepared in collaboration with landowners, aiming to increase local fruit supply. The aim is to increase the area of permanent crops by at least 100 hectares by 2030.

**Rational fertilization of crops with nitrogen:** Rational fertilization of agricultural crops with nitrogen is a key element of sustainable farming. Various initiatives, including incentives for implementing advanced farming practices actively contributing to the reduction of nitrous oxide emissions, have been introduced to promote responsible fertilization practices. Agricultural enterprises are eligible for financial incentives to invest in essential assets aimed at improving overall efficiency in agricultural activities. Simultaneously, there is encouragement to invest in infrastructure related to the development and adaptation of agriculture to modern standards. Public agricultural advisory services operate to provide expert support and advice, assisting farmers in implementing sustainable fertilization practices and contributing to the preservation of environmental quality.

**More efficient nitrogen circulation in agriculture – gross nitrogen balance surplus:** Efficient nitrogen circulation in agriculture is crucial for the sustainable management of natural resources.

|   | implementation of advanced nitrogen cycling practices. Additionally, financial incentives for investments in essential assets that enhance the overall efficiency of agricultural enterprises are also available. Investments in infrastructure related to the development and adaptation of agriculture to modern standards are crucial for the sustainable management of agricultural resources. Public agricultural advisory services play a key role in providing expert support and advice to farmers, contributing to better nitrogen cycling management in agricultural practices. Continuous investment in research and innovation in agriculture is essential for the development of new methods and technologies that will further increase the efficiency of nitrogen cycling while reducing negative impacts on the environment. Increasing the efficiency of domestic animal breeding: A joint basic breeding program for cattle and small livestock breeds will be actively pursued by the city, with an emphasis on improving the efficiency of feed energy utilization. In this context, greater emphasis is placed on selection for more efficient feed energy utilization, while efforts are made to develop options for direct selection with the aim of reducing methane emissions - a significant contribution to the mitigation of greenhouse gas effects in animal farming. A crucial role will be played by public agricultural advisory services in providing farmers with expert support and advice, thereby enhancing conditions for animal husbandry. In addition, incentives will be implemented by the city to encourage the adoption of advanced farming practices, with a specific focus on reducing methane emissions. Agricultural enterprises will be eligible for financial incentives, promoting investments in essential assets to enhance overall agricultural efficiency. This will include the development and adaptation of infrastructure to meet modern standards, ensuring a holistic approach to advancing animal farming sustainability. Upgrading agricultural policy - integrating climate policy and climate change adaptation: The upgrade of agricultural policy, which involves the integration of climate policy and  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  Action outline | Action name | Organizational, incentive, and awareness-raising measures  |
|   | Action type | Other interventions  |
|   | Action description | **Raising public awareness of the importance of green spaces:**
Public awareness about the importance of vegetation in urban environments will be raised through campaigns, workshops, and the distribution of informative materials and online tools (e.g., “Invazivka”) among others. The goal is to emphasize the benefits of vegetation for human well-being and the environment and to encourage active involvement in the preservation and nurturing of green areas in the city.

**Promoting sustainable forest management:** Sustainable forest management is the key to maintaining or increasing the sink and providing other ecosystem services. With this measure, we particularly want to improve the management of privately owned forests, as they strongly dominate (more than 90%) the forest land of the City of Ljubljana. In cooperation with the Slovenia Forest Service, we will carry out a campaign to encourage private forest owners to increase the scope of restoration and protection work, including the adjustment of tree species composition (e.g. vulnerable spruce forests in lowlands) in accordance with forest management plans. With this measure, we want to encourage forest owners who do not carry out management to make them aware of the possibilities of obtaining funds from the state financial program for investments in forests and from tenders of the new CAP strategic plan and other funds. In addition, the city will examine options and make proposals to improve forestry legislation.

**Enhanced control over logging and timber extraction from forests:**
With this measure, we want to reduce the number of unauthorized interventions in the forest and at the same time reduce forest damage that can be caused by improper management. Damage to the forest can also be caused by non-compliance with standards when building forest roads, which can result in damage to the forest floor, erosion, and the like. In the forests within the administrative area of the city, we will step up controls on the construction of forest roads and tracks and on logging and timber harvesting. In cooperation with the public forestry service and inspectors, we will examine which are the critical areas  |

|   | and determine where violations occur more frequently.  |
| --- | --- |
|   | **Increased control over the implementation of greening measures:**
These are measures aimed at improving the supervision of greening implementation, including the introduction of regular and systematic inspections and assessments of green areas in the city, the use of technological solutions for monitoring and recording progress, and the establishment of mechanisms for collaboration among various stakeholders in monitoring and reporting on the implementation of measures. The goal is to ensure the effective implementation of greening projects and to monitor and evaluate their impact on the urban environment.

For the example of roof greening, rules are already established in the municipal spatial plan, but in practice, it is evident that investors do not always adhere to them. According to the municipal spatial plan, all buildings with a flat roof and a net area greater than 400 m² are required to have a green roof covering at least 75% of the net roof area. In the case of new buildings in shopping centres with a roof area exceeding 100 m², the buildings must be entirely covered with a green roof or have at least two facades designed in the form of vertical green ecosystems. This measure ensures stricter control of projects, ensuring compliance with regulations, particularly concerning the percentage of green areas and the implementation of green roofs.  |
|   | **Promotion of climate and environment-oriented CAP interventions:**
In the City of Ljubljana, the local production of food and animal feed is promoted, which shortens the distance from the field to the consumer. With the "Green Supply Chain" project, we are promoting organic and integrated production as well as the cultivation of local and domestic varieties and their seasonal consumption. With this action, we want to encourage farmers to participate in CAP measures that are known to help mitigate climate change. These measures are, for example, agri-environmental climate payments, organic farming, eco-schemes, conservation of permanent grassland, etc., which we assume will be implemented through the Slovenian 2023-2027 CAP Strategic Plan.  |
|   | **Incentives for the implementation of advanced agricultural practices that**  |
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   |  | contribute to the reduction of nitrous oxide emissions:
Incentives for implementing advanced farming practices are aimed at reducing nitrous oxide emissions. As part of the future rural development programme, there is a particular emphasis on promoting low-ammonia emission fertilization. This approach prioritizes the use of innovative fertilization practices, actively contributing to the reduction of harmful gas emissions while ensuring efficient and sustainable agricultural activities.

Incentives for the implementation of advanced agricultural practices that contribute to reducing methane emissions:
Incentives for implementing advanced farming practices are aimed at reducing methane emissions. As part of the future rural development programme, there are plans to provide incentives to improve the quality of feed and feed rations for cattle and small livestock. This approach encourages farmers to adopt innovative practices in animal nutrition, thereby reducing methane emissions, a significant contributor to greenhouse gases. These measures aim to enhance the quality of feed rations, positively impacting emission reduction and improving conditions for livestock farming.

Establishment of the Green Infrastructure and Nature-based Solutions department:
Establishing a department for green infrastructure and nature-based solutions is recognized in many cities worldwide as key to improving the environmental sustainability of urban areas. This department focuses on the development and management of green spaces, promoting biodiversity, integrating natural elements into urban infrastructure, and encouraging innovative solutions to climate change adaptation. Its operation strengthens the natural environment in the city and creates conditions for a healthier and more sustainable living environment for residents. The establishment of a department for green infrastructure and nature-based solutions is specifically focused on the ecological and sustainable aspects of urban areas that go beyond traditional spatial or environmental management.  |

Urban courtyards represent a significant potential in creating urban spaces that can combine functionality, aesthetics, and social dynamics. Urban courtyards promote interaction among communities, offer peaceful oases in urban bustle and contribute to improving the quality of urban life. Within the measure, all functionalities offered by such courtyards will be examined with a focus on preserving or increasing green areas and creating space dedicated to encounters, relaxation, and social activities for residents.

The measure includes the following activities: (1) Inventory of all urban courtyards and examination of their current functionality. (2) Examining the possibility of revitalizing city courtyards. (3) Implementation of the urban courtyard revitalization project. In the second phase, the measure is expanded to the area around residential neighbourhoods.

**Establishment of self-sufficient neighbourhoods:**

The measure combines the principles of sustainable construction, energy efficiency and mixed land use for the development of comprehensive and self-sufficient urban neighbourhoods. It includes planning neighbourhoods that are energy-neutral or positive, with a high degree of autonomy in energy, water, and food supply. It may involve solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, community gardens and local markets designed to promote sustainable lifestyles among residents and reduce the neighbourhood's ecological footprint.

**Planning and establishment of new public spaces:**

The measure in the planning and establishment of new public spaces involves (1) identifying potential locations for creating new public spaces, (2) planning their arrangement and design, with the involvement of the community and local stakeholders in the planning process to ensure that the spaces reflect the needs and desires of the local population and (3) implementing projects for their establishment. The goal is to improve the quality of urban living, ensure access to green areas, create social and recreational spaces, and promote public life and activities for residents.

**Spatial planning considering microclimatic conditions to improve public health and well-being:**
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   |  | Measures in the field of urban infrastructure planning considering microclimatic conditions to improve public health and well-being include analysing microclimatic conditions in the city, which involves studying local climate conditions in a small area. This includes temperature, humidity, air movement, wind, solar exposure, and similar factors. Based on this analysis, problematic areas are identified, such as excessive heat, air pollution or lack of green spaces and infrastructure adjustments are planned and implemented, such as tree planting, installation of shading devices, development of parks and green areas, air ventilation and proper positioning of buildings and roads. The goal is to create a pleasant and healthy urban environment that promotes active living and well-being for all residents.

Special attention is paid to the analysis and measures for locations with the most vulnerable population: the medical area of Vodmat (University medical centre + Institute of Oncology), areas with dense construction and limited green spaces.  |

The aim of the guidelines is to ensure that all new construction and development projects are carried out in a manner that supports ecological balance, reduces the need for fossil fuels, and enhances urban greenery. The implementation of the guidelines involves collaboration among various stakeholders, public education and awareness, the introduction of legislative and financial incentives for sustainable projects and regular monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of measures.  |
| --- | --- |
|  **Development of guidelines for project tasks for competitions:**
The project tasks for competitions represent a specific approach to incorporating principles of sustainable development and climate responsibility into the process of design and architecture. Competition tasks are designed to encourage innovative solutions to challenges related to climate change, such as energy efficiency, use of renewable energy sources, reduction of GHG emissions, water resource management and integration of green areas into urban fabric. Through the competition process, creative and practical solutions are sought, which can serve as models for future projects, while also highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration and the use of sustainable materials and technologies. Competitions thus become a platform for the development and presentation of advanced concepts that can contribute to reducing the environmental footprint of cities and improving the quality of life of their residents.  |   |
|  **Proactive land policy for climate change mitigation and adaptation:**
Proactive land policy for climate change mitigation is thus a fundamental measure to ensure that land use is directed towards sustainability, preserving natural resources, and enhancing ecosystem services necessary for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This approach emphasises the need for comprehensive and coordinated action at various levels of governance to protect land crucial for ecological stability and the well-being of future generations.  |   |
|  The measure includes the following activities: (1) Protecting agricultural and undeveloped land: putting in place legislative and regulatory frameworks to protect land that is important for maintaining ecological balance, preventing  |   |
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

|   |  | urban sprawl, and ensuring sustainable food supplies. (2) Preserving green wedges: ensuring that green spaces that penetrate the urban fabric are protected from development. This includes preserving and developing parks, nature reserves and other green spaces that serve as the "lungs" of cities and contribute to improving air quality, reducing heat islands, and promoting recreation and well-being for residents. (3) Priority land acquisition for the development and preservation of green spaces: active search and acquisition of land by the city with a view to preserving it as green space or converting it into public parks, gardens, and other forms of urban green space. (4) Promotion of sustainable land use: Encouraging agricultural practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase carbon sequestration, and support biodiversity. This includes supporting organic farming, agroecology, and permaculture. (5) Integrating climate objectives into spatial planning: integrating climate objectives into spatial planning processes to ensure that urban and rural development considers the need to reduce emissions, adapt to climate change and preserve natural ecosystems.  |

## B-2.3: Summary strategy for residual emissions

The highest residual emissions, which cannot be fully contained, are still in the transport sector, as most of this sector currently depends on the use of fossil fuels. The transport sector contributes around one-third to baseline emissions. Despite very optimistic and ambitious measures, 259,881 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ or $56.5\%$ of the total residual emissions would remain in the transport sector. Residual emissions in the buildings sector would amount to 138,029 tonnes (30.0%), emissions from waste management to 28,510 tonnes (6.2%), in agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) to 20,058 tonnes (4.4%) excluding natural carbon removals, and in the industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector to 13,838 tonnes (3.0%). In total, the remaining emissions will amount to 460,316 tonnes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ and will be offset by natural carbon sinks in forests and other areas and by carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies to achieve climate neutrality.

Areas in the city of Ljubljana that contribute to carbon sinks include forest land, grassland, settlements, and cropland. In the base year 2018, with unchanged land use, these categories together contributed to a net carbon sink of -54,449 tonnes (-46,398 tonnes on forest land, -6,768 on settlements, -898 on grassland and -385 tonnes on cropland). The most important category is the forest land remaining forest land, which account for up to 85% of net sinks. Remaining settlements (green spaces in urban areas) and land converted to forest are also important carbon sinks. Changes in land use, including activities such as deforestation for agricultural expansion, conversion of agricultural land to settlements and for the construction of other infrastructure, have resulted in a net source of CO₂ emissions of 5,349 tonnes. The total net emissions/removals of CO₂ in 2018 amounted to -49,100 tonnes.

To achieve the set target, measures are planned to increase the natural carbon sinks in the City of Ljubljana to reach the target value of 65,700 tonnes of CO₂. With a focus on forest areas, grassland, urban green areas and cropland, measures will be implemented to further strengthen efforts to increase natural carbon sinks. This will strengthen the role of forests and other natural ecosystems as efficient carbon sinks and contribute to more sustainable land management in the urban environment.

The introduction of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies enables the reuse of captured carbon, which can lead to a reduction of emissions into the atmosphere. However, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies cannot be used in Slovenia due to unsuitable geological structures. The main energy production unit (cogeneration at the TE-TOL site in Ljubljana-Moste), which is connected to the Ljubljana district heating system, will use biogas and biomass. We assume that a significant part of the generated CO₂ emissions will be captured using carbon capture technologies, resulting in negative emissions. The same principle of carbon capture will be applied to a new 55 MW waste-to-energy plant. As the waste incineration plant will generate greenhouse gas emissions based on both fossil and non-fossil components of waste (approx. 110,150 t CO₂e/year), we assume that carbon capture technology will be used to capture all (100%) emissions, resulting in negative emissions (based on the proportion of bio-components in the waste-derived fuel). For both sites, considering the projected use of wood biomass, biogas and municipal waste for energy use, CO₂ capture is expected to be 394,616 tonnes per year. The CO₂ captured at both sites will be transported to suitable (local/regional) industries that will reuse it in their processes. Various technologies, including those for producing plastics, concrete, chemical reagents, and synthetic fuels, are in use or under development.

The costs of projects to increase urban green areas (green roofs and facades, surface unsealing, establishing new green areas, tree planting, etc.), forest management and conservation, and other measures to enhance natural carbon sinks are estimated at 143,447 million EUR, while the cost of implementing CCU technologies is estimated at over 51 million EUR.

# 4 Part C – Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030

Part C "Enabling Climate Neutrality by 2030" aims to outline any enabling interventions, i.e., regarding organisational setting or collaborative governance models or related to social innovations – designed to support the climate action portfolios (Module B-2) as well as aiming to achieve co-benefits outlined in the impact pathway (Module B-1). These interventions also address the identified opportunities, gaps and barriers identified Module A-2 and A-3.

# 4.1 Module C-1 Governance Innovation Interventions

This module details the city's governance innovations for achieving city climate neutrality by 2030, describing innovations in institutional design, in leadership, and in collaborative and outreach processes, whether they are inter-organisational or internal to the key organisations responsible for the city's climate neutrality target. It also describes expected outcomes, for example how these governance innovations enable climate actions and their co-benefits (outlined in Modules B-1 and B-2), and how they address the opportunities, gaps and barriers identified in Modules A-2 and A-3.

# COORDINATION OF THE CLIMATE AGENDA &amp; CITY'S GOVERNANCE APPROACH

The large city family of Ljubljana consists of 12,000 employees in the administration, in public companies (Public Holding Ljubljana) and in institutions and is headed by a mayor.

The mayor makes the final decisions following consultations in a committee made up of the heads of the individual organisational units and the director of the local regional agency of the Ljubljana region. Six deputy mayors are appointed, each of whom is responsible for a specific area: One of them is specifically responsible for the areas of environmental protection, climate change and spatial planning.

All strategies and important guidelines are adopted by the city council. In the area of climate change, a uniform policy is pursued within the city administration, public companies, and institutions.

Within the city's jurisdiction, the city has the legal authority over urban infrastructure and the resources, in line with legal requirements, to take policy measures and act in various critical areas. These include buildings and construction, waste and wastewater management, water resource management, public health, energy management in neighbourhood systems, environment, urban land use, disaster risk, public transport, urban green spaces and green infrastructure, and oversight of financial matters and investments. The CCC is led by the Head of the city's Environmental Protection Department who reports to the deputy mayor responsible for Environmental Protection department, Climate Change and Spatial planning Department.

The commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 is supported by Ljubljana's leadership and is firmly anchored in the city's entire organisational structure.

Figure 21: Transition Team Model Ljubljana.

Figures demonstrated Transition Team Model Ljubljana, formed in Local coalition, composing of several components (Top city management, City transitional team, Local transitional team and Council for Climate Change City of Ljubljana).

In the first months of 2023, the mayor took the decisive step of appointing a project manager on the city side (head of the city's environmental protection department). At the same time, a Core City Team (CCT) was formed, consisting of five prominent heads of various public administration departments (Head of the City's Environmental Protection Department (coordinating the city's climate neutrality goals), the Energy Manager, the Head of the City Planning Department, the Head of the Commercial Activities and Transport Department and a representative of the Development Projects and Investment Office). This strategic formation of the CCT was a significant step towards a coordinated and effective approach to climate protection measures. The CCT is entrusted with the operational tasks, day-to-day implementation, and ongoing monitoring of the project.

At the same time, the mayor appointed the City Transitional Team (CTT). This team, which is made up of twenty-three different representatives from both the city administration and public companies and institutions, embodies the city's comprehensive and integrative strategy for achieving climate neutrality. The establishment of the CTT reflects Ljubljana's commitment to a holistic approach that

incorporates different perspectives and expertise to effectively address the challenges and opportunities of the transition to a climate-neutral future.

Ljubljana attaches great importance to involving all relevant stakeholders in the process, from planning to implementation. In January 2023, the city developed a CCC Participatory-Communication Strategy a strategy for participatory communication of the CCC. This strategy, which aims to promote a structured, transparent, and inclusive process, is based on a variety of initiatives, events, and activities. It reflects a broad range of perspectives, needs, and interests and focuses on key areas that are essential for the transformation of the city (more detailed in sections A-3.2 of the action plan).

In 2022, the City of Ljubljana invited all stakeholders living and working in the city, including experts from various fields, non-governmental organisations and active individuals with the knowledge, ideas, and willingness to co-create a common future in mitigating the effects of climate change and decarbonising the city. An interest group (ISG) (34 members) was formed as one of the city's most important new organisational formations. The formation of this group was an important step in bringing a broad range of perspectives and expertise to Ljubljana's climate strategy.

Building on the foundation laid by the City Transition Team (CTT) and the Interested Stakeholder Group (ISG), the Local Transition Team (LTT) was formed in January 2023, additionally comprising Specialised Focus Teams (SFT) in seven key areas: Energy, nature-based solutions, health, mobility, built environment, circular economy and waste, and digitalisation. The groups include citizens, non-governmental organisations, governmental organisations, social enterprises, the science and education sector, the municipal administration, municipal enterprises, state-owned enterprises, the business sector, civil society, vulnerable groups, and the public media (see Chapter A 3-2). The team is important because it represents a group of stakeholders who have been identified as key stakeholders for a precisely defined area through stakeholder mapping.

In February 2023, the CTT convened for its first meeting - an important milestone on Ljubljana's path to climate action. The agenda included a comprehensive assessment of current policies and the identification of systemic barriers and opportunities. The Basecamp platform was used for this purpose, which proved helpful in optimising communication and joint assessment.

# INVOLVEMENT OF RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS AND CITIZENS

Since the decision to join the CCC, Ljubljana has experienced a surge of activity characterised by a series of collaborative and interactive events. These have included workshops, meetings, presentations, public invitations, the establishment of an Info Point on climate change (one stop shop) etc., all aimed at fostering a common understanding and partnership on the city's path to climate neutrality.

In October 2022, an initial meeting was held with the stakeholder group (ISG) to inform them about the procedures for preparing the documentation and to jointly assess the importance of their participation. Subsequently, their participation was diversified and included bilateral meetings, the submission of written contributions, active participation in workshops and events and the signing of agreements during the preparation of the action plan.

Since the beginning of 2023, the new city of Ljubljana has set up new channels for citizen participation, such as the website "On the Path to a Carbon-Neutral Ljubljana 2030" Na poti v brezogljično Ljubljano 2030 » Mestna občina Ljubljana, which provides comprehensive information about the activities on the path to climate neutrality: The website contains all the information on the activities planned or carried out on the city's path to carbon neutrality.

October and November 2023 were the crucial months in which the first five comprehensive workshops on "Energy", "Mobility", "Nature-Based Solutions", "Waste and Circular Economy" and "Build environment" took place. These workshops brought together stakeholders from different
#

#

backgrounds and fostered an environment for joint planning and action. The workshops were very well attended and attracted 195 participants from different stakeholder groups, including residents, NGO representatives, ministries, government institutions, private companies, youth, elderly people, and others.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Figure 22: Participation process.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

The three additional workshops in November 2023 on the topics of "City of good accessibility", "Appearance of the city and urban landscape" and "Resilience to climate change" served as an extension and improvement of the existing five workshops and supported the overall goal of developing the city's climate neutrality action plan. The workshops were very well attended with 90 participants from various stakeholder groups.

The CCT also organised and chaired numerous meetings with the Specialised Focus Teams (SFT) over several sessions to ensure coherent planning and effective implementation of the climate change strategies. As the topics are interlinked, members of certain focus groups also participated in the meetings of other groups, e.g. on integrating digitalisation into nature-based solutions (NBS) or addressing health aspects in the energy sector.

The City of Ljubljana demonstrated the importance of accessibility of information for all stakeholders by opening an Info Point on climate change (one stop shop) (November 2023 dedicated to the path to climate neutrality in November 2023. This central innovation hub serves as a testing ground for shared ideas that are essential to achieving the common goal of climate neutrality. The Info Point acts as a central resource that provides citizens, NGOs, business representatives, educational and research institutions, government administration and other visitors with comprehensive information and guides them towards various steps and approaches that can contribute to achieving the city's climate-neutral goal.

In October 2023, the City of Ljubljana hosted an international event on "Climate Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030", which focused on future paths, visions and strategies that are important for the further development of urban development in order to achieve the goals of climate neutrality and the smart city.

Figure 24: Stakeholder involvement.

Figure demonstrates identified stakeholder groups and method of inclusion for each stakeholder groups as inclusion while preparing CCC Participatory- Communication Strategy, inclusion in Focus meetings, public events, etc.

Engaging citizens through the existing platforms such as the Citizens' initiatives office established in 2003, the Citizens' initiatives web, the mayor's open day and the  $65+$  Information Point supporting seniors and people with disabilities were as well the mechanisms used in preparation of CCC. The direct communication with citizens, namely enables deeper understanding of their perspectives and challenges on climate change and provided valuable insights.

Beyond the urban ecosystem, participation at regional, national, and international levels is ensured through well-established formations: (1) The Mayor of Ljubljana is a member of the Council of the Ljubljana City Region, which comprises 25 member municipalities. (2) The City of Ljubljana actively

C-2.2: Description of social innovation interventions

## SOCIAL INNOVATIONS ADDRESSING THE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CLIMATE NEUTRALITY

## ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES, INCENTIVES AND AWARENESS-RAISING MEASURES

The city has taken a wide range of organisational measures and is planning further measures to involve stakeholders and citizens in the climate neutrality process and to overcome existing barriers to participation and enablement:

### Energy Systems:

Promotion of energy efficiency and transition to renewable sources.
Creating new jobs in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency.
Energy poverty.
Energy communities.
Energy consulting office.
Research/educational content.

To promote energy efficiency, we will organise awareness-raising events and workshops and create a website tool that provides information on energy and cost savings when renovating homes. Collaboration with educational institutions will enable the training of workers and the promotion of innovation in the energy sector. The implementation of the measures is based on the national action plan to combat energy poverty, which provides for investment incentives and the establishment of advice centres.

The promotion of energy communities increases energy self-sufficiency and raises awareness of the sustainable use of energy. The energy advice centre offers information and advice for a more sustainable energy future. The research topics in the field of energy cover various aspects that influence energy efficiency and analyse social and psychological factors of energy consumption. The aim is to promote sustainable habits and combat energy poverty, focussing on a holistic approach to tackling the challenges of sustainable energy supply in the urban environment.

### Mobility &amp; Transport:

Promoting sustainable mobility.
Development of a new Sustainable urban mobility plan (SUMP).
Research/educational content.
Transport poverty.
Establishment of the sustainable mobility department.
Coordinating the needs of users who gravitate towards the City of Ljubljana.

### Enhancing public transportation

Various measures will be implemented to significantly improve the overall public transportation system. This includes the introduction of additional urban public transport lines, increasing departure frequencies, adding bus lanes, smart traffic light management and using longer vehicles. Efforts will also focus on optimizing travel times, ensuring more efficient and punctual passenger transport.

Improvements in railway public transport will be pursued to provide seamless and integrated travel experiences. Additionally, the renovation of the main bus and train station is planned to modernize

and enhance the central public transportation hub. The area will be redesigned with new green spaces and safer traffic zones, aligned with the principles of sustainable mobility.

Improvements in railway public transport will be pursued to provide seamless and integrated travel experiences. Additionally, the renovation of the main bus and train station is planned to modernize and enhance the central public transportation hub. The area will be redesigned with new green spaces and safer traffic zones, aligned with the principles of sustainable mobility.

To expand public transportation options in the city centre, a circular route along the Ljubljanica river is planned, offering an alternative and eco-friendly mode of transport.

Furthermore, the introduction of a unified ticketing system for all passengers is envisaged to allow the use of a single ticket for various modes of transportation, promoting easy access and enhancing the attractiveness of public transport. These combined initiatives aim to create a more robust, accessible, and sustainable public transportation system for the community.

## Improving green mobility and managing accessibility

The main goal of the measure is to reduce personal vehicle traffic in the city centre and areas outside the bypass, thereby alleviating congestion and encouraging the use of public transportation. These measures will be implemented after improving public transportation services to ensure a fair transition. The establishment of community mobility infrastructure is also planned, involving the development and implementation of transportation solutions tailored to community needs. This approach not only enhances transportation links and accessibility but also strengthens community spirit, cooperation, and contributes to a more sustainable and connected urban environment.

Building two new Park and Ride (P+R) facilities will encourage daily commuters to use public transportation, further reducing traffic in the city centre. These parking areas will be connected to new river public transportation stops, enabling travel to the city centre via river e-vessels.

Efforts to improve accessibility for all will continue with the development of services facilitating easier and more comfortable sustainable travel, including the expansion and enhancement of transportation services for people with disabilities through the "Kavalir" program.

The anticipated effects of the measures are a 28% reduction in kilometres travelled by private cars.

**Measures to promote sustainable mobility** include the promotion of cycling, walking, the use of renewable energy sources and public transport.

The development of a new comprehensive transport strategy for the city of Ljubljana is being carried out in co-operation with various stakeholders and includes the definition of targets, measures and mechanisms for monitoring and reporting.

Research and educational activities focus on technological, infrastructural, social, and psychological aspects of sustainable mobility and aim to develop strategies to promote sustainable habits in the urban environment.

Urban policy is already combating transport poverty by subsidising public transport, expanding cycling infrastructure and other measures. The action plan will complement these measures to reduce transport poverty, while the national plan will continue a comprehensive approach at national and local level.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

The establishment of the Sustainable Mobility Department in the City of Ljubljana follows the global trend of many cities recognising the importance of sustainable mobility for the quality of life and the environment. This department enables a comprehensive approach to transport policy and coordinated action across all sectors, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating a healthier urban environment.

The adaptation of parking facilities and sustainable mobility in the city of Ljubljana is done by analysing and considering the needs of users from other municipalities before they arrive in Ljubljana.

## Improving infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians

The comprehensive measures aim to enhance the urban environment by improving conditions for pedestrians and cyclists. This includes the development of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure and dedicated cycling lanes. In addition, the initiative involves transforming conventional traffic zones into green and recreational spaces, fostering a more sustainable and liveable urban landscape. The promotion of walking and cycling is actively encouraged through awareness campaigns, educational initiatives, and community engagement programs, fostering a culture of environmentally friendly and healthy modes of transportation.

## Green and blue-green infrastructure:

Greening the city.
Sustainable water management.
Raising public awareness of the importance of green spaces.
Promoting sustainable forest management.
Enhanced control over logging and timber extraction from forests.
Increased control over the implementation of greening measures.

Incentives for the implementation of advanced agricultural practices that contribute to the reduction of nitrous oxide emissions.
Incentives for the implementation of advanced agricultural practices that contribute to reducing methane emissions.
Establishment of the Green Infrastructure and Nature-based Solutions department.

Awareness about the importance of greenery in cities will be raised through campaigns, workshops, distribution of materials and online resources, focusing on the benefits for people and the environment and promoting care for green spaces.

## Forest management

Maintaining stable forest area.

A campaign to improve the management of private forests will encourage restoration work, adaptation of tree species and awareness about funding and legislation. The City of Ljubljana will strengthen supervision of the construction of forest roads, logging, timber harvesting and develop a plan to protect sensitive areas. Measures to monitor greening will include regular inspections, technological solutions, stakeholder collaboration for effective project implementation and monitoring of urban environmental impact.

## Sustainable agriculture and agricultural policy

Protection of agricultural land and increasing local self-sufficiency.
Conservation and restoration of hedges and riparian buffer strips.
Increasing the area of permanent crops.

Rational fertilization of crops with nitrogen.
More efficient nitrogen circulation in agriculture – gross nitrogen balance surplus.
Increasing the efficiency of domestic animal breeding.
Upgrading agricultural policy - integrating climate policy and climate change adaptation.

## Built environment

Evaluation of land based on its current use, classification, and future societal needs.
Development of guidelines for the implementation of spatial integration measures.
Development of guidelines for project tasks for competitions.
Proactive land policy for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Preparation of spatial analysis and land evaluation based on existing data is crucial for determining priorities and goals in future municipal spatial plans. The main goal of this measure is to preserve green areas outside the urban area of the City of Ljubljana, thereby reducing emissions from deforestation by 50% and emissions from construction by 25% by 2030 compared to 2018.

The development of Guidelines for the implementation of spatial integration measures is a strategic step towards promoting sustainable development and reducing the impact of climate change. Project tasks for competitions and proactive land policy represent additional approaches to integrating sustainable practices and mitigating climate change into urban design and land management.

## ENGAGING AND COLLABORATING WITH STAKEHOLDERS

Integrative approaches to social innovation, collaboration, and inclusion:

Integrated participatory and communication strategy for Climate Neutral Ljubljana by 2030.
Workshops on participatory urban planning.
Programs for green communities.
Active use of stakeholder engagement platforms.
Educational and awareness campaigns about climate change.
Local challenges in the field of sustainable development (Financial Participatory Approach, regulatory sandpits).

## Integrated participation and communication strategy for climate-neutral Ljubljana by 2030:

The comprehensive participation and communication strategy for "Climate Neutral Ljubljana by 2030" represents a key measure that combines the development and implementation of a comprehensive, open, and inclusive approach to involving residents in decision-making processes, policy formulation and project implementation with the goal of climate neutrality. This strategy emphasises the importance of transparency and accessibility of information, strengthening dialogue and collaboration between local authorities, local communities, businesses, academia, and civil society.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

In order to develop the action and financial plan to achieve climate neutrality in the city of Ljubljana by 2030, a participatory communication strategy was developed, including a detailed stakeholder analysis. The measure represents a continuation of efforts to develop a comprehensive and transparent approach to public involvement and access to information.

## Participatory urban planning workshops:

Participatory planning workshops enable the local population to take an active part in shaping the urban environment. An example of this is the renovation of a city park, where the ideas of the local population are incorporated into the final design that meets the needs of the community. Workshops are held on site in the city and offer the opportunity to gradually introduce measures and test their suitability.

## Green communities programmes:

Green community programmes include initiatives such as urban gardening, tree planting and community clean-ups. Such programmes promote a sense of ownership among residents and contribute to the greening and biodiversity of the city. These activities not only provide space for urban agriculture, but also serve as inclusive social centres where people from different backgrounds can come together, share ideas, and learn from each other.

The measure includes the establishment of a mechanism for the management of green spaces and co-operation between the city and individual landowners.

## Active use of stakeholder engagement platforms:

The measure includes the establishment of mobile applications and social channels, etc. that allow for ongoing dialogue, collection of input, dissemination of information on sustainable initiatives and reporting on progress towards common action goals.

## Climate change education and awareness campaigns:

Campaigns will include various interactive and educational formats, including workshops, seminars, school programmes and media campaigns. Innovative formats such as hackathons, boot camps, maker fairs, technology meetings, think tanks and innovation labs will actively engage participants, especially young people, in developing and understanding models that are in line with the city's goals. In addition, the City of Ljubljana's Climate Point, which acts as a one-stop shop, will play an important role in climate change awareness raising and educational activities, ensuring accessibility and inclusion of different community needs, with a focus on the involvement and cooperation of all stakeholders.

## Local competitions and contests:

Competitions and contests are organised to encourage people, especially young people, to find innovative solutions to local sustainability challenges. These challenges can range from sustainable local food production and waste reduction to innovation competitions for sustainable technologies such as new bike-sharing technologies or environmentally friendly applications to reduce energy bills.

## Training and workshops on adaptation and mitigation:

This group of activities focuses on engaging communities most affected by climate change (vulnerable groups), particularly in areas such as a just transition to energy and mobility. Activities to strengthen community resilience and adaptation include:

Creating a catalogue of relevant content for stakeholders (addressing concerns, sharing experiences) and actively participating in the design of solutions to their specific challenges.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Working together to organise resilience-building workshops and training in collaboration with universities and research institutes that focus on building resilience to the impacts of climate change, e.g. how to build, renovate and prepare for floods or heatwaves.

## Establishment of health services related to climate change:

Increased collaboration with the health sector providing services such as health screening, counselling and support groups that focus specifically on addressing physical and mental health problems caused by climate change. Establishment of new mechanisms.

## Cultural and artistic projects for sustainable development:

Incorporating arts and culture to educate, disseminate information and promote the importance of climate neutrality, e.g. by increasing the promotion and organisation of art exhibitions, performances and festivals or creating public art installations that raise awareness of climate change and its impacts.

## Sports projects for sustainable development:

Sports projects are an important component in education, information dissemination and promoting the importance of climate neutrality. When organising these events, particular attention is paid to the creation of circular material flows and the sustainable use of materials.

## Comprehensive initiative to promote sustainable certifications:

The measure aims to raise awareness and promote the use of internationally recognised sustainable certificates and standards in various sectors, including construction, energy, agriculture, tourism, circular economy, etc. The initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of sustainable practices in achieving climate neutrality and sustainable development through education, partnerships and supporting stakeholders in obtaining certifications (e.g. ISO 50001, LEED, BREEAM, DGNB, Cradle to Cradle Certified™, Zero Waste Certification, Green Globe Certification, Travelife, Envision™ and Greenroads®, Green Infrastructure Certification Programme, Digital Accessibility Certifications and B Corporation, etc.).

## Biodiversity conservation projects at the community level:

These initiatives include wildlife migration monitoring programmes, native plant species planting campaigns or community-managed green spaces. Local wildlife monitoring programmes, for example, allow residents to track and document the presence of wildlife in their area, promoting a better understanding of ecosystems and contributing to biodiversity conservation. Native plant species planting campaigns encourage the use of local plants adapted to climatic conditions and contribute to the preservation of natural habitats. Green spaces managed by the city enable the local population to actively participate in the planning, maintenance and use of green spaces in their neighbourhood, thus creating pleasant and sustainable public spaces.

## The information point about Ljubljana's path to climate neutrality:

The Info Point on climate change (one stop shop) serves as a central resource that provides residents, non-governmental organisations, business representatives, educational and research institutions, government agencies and other visitors with comprehensive information on various steps and approaches that can help achieve the city's goal of climate neutrality.

## The outcomes and enabling impacts of these approaches are:

an improved public engagement leading to better decision-making for climate neutrality.
Active involvement of residents in shaping urban environments and incorporation of community ideas into final designs.
Community programs foster ownership, enhance greenery, and biodiversity.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Active stakeholder engagement platforms facilitate continuous dialogue, contribution collection, and dissemination of information on sustainable initiatives.
Educational and awareness campaigns about climate change engage youth through innovative formats and promote accessibility via the Climate point.
Local competitions encourage innovative sustainability solutions, particularly engaging youth.
Adaptation and mitigation workshops to enhance community resilience, especially among vulnerable groups, through collaboration with universities and research institutes.
Strengthened collaboration with healthcare for addressing physical and mental health issues due to climate change.
Cultural and artistic projects for education, information dissemination, advocating climate neutrality, and raising awareness of climate change impacts.
Sports projects for sustainable development emphasise circular material flows, and sustainable practices in sports events.
The comprehensive initiative promotes sustainable certifications and encourages sustainable practices within the relevant sector.
Community-level biodiversity projects include wildlife monitoring for ecosystem understanding and campaigns for planting indigenous plants.
The information point serves as a central hub providing comprehensive information to various stakeholders.

## ADDRESSING SOCIETAL CHALLENGES WITH A BOTTOM-UP, COLLABORATIVE, HOLISTIC AND PEOPLE-CENTRED APPROACH TO INNOVATION

The city of Ljubljana addresses societal challenges with a bottom-up, collaborative, holistic and people-centred approach to innovation. The city has already conducted extensive and numerous experiments in research projects to develop new products, services or business models that improve the well-being and prosperity of the community and promote behavioural change and social transformation. It ensures that economic development and the overall well-being of people and the planet are taken into account. It strengthens the co-benefits of climate action, such as improved public health, job creation, public budget savings and more, and builds local capacity to tackle the challenges of decarbonisation. The examples listed here show how the city is creating opportunities for a wide range of stakeholders to co-create solutions through social innovation. The city's projects are categorised and listed according to their contribution to entrepreneurship, social economy, social awareness and mobilisation, social cohesion and solidarity.

## CHILDREN PLANNING CITIES

http://www.pazipark.si/en/portfolio/children-planning-cities/

Location: Centre of urban culture Kino Šiška
Date of performance: October 15th 2019 at 10:00

Organizer: Pazi!park Associationin collaboration with the Kino Šiška Urban Culture Centre and with funding of City community Ljubljana and Ministry of environment and area Republic of Slovenia.

On Tuesday, October 15th 2019, in the co-organization of the Pazi!Park Association and the Kino Šiška Urban Culture Center, an event dedicated to the development of child- and youth-friendly cities took place for the second year in a row, this time entitled "Children plan a city".

The child-friendly place is friendly to all users. Although the current practice in our country does not yet emphasize the importance of children as co-creators of public open space, children in cities are becoming an increasingly topical topic that touches on many areas. When we talk about planning a space tailored to children, it is therefore necessary to include children as competent interlocutors for adults, as children are able to articulate their needs and desires, cooperate with others and co-create a common space. "I would close the roads and arrange forest paths instead," said the second-grader, explaining that cars are noisy, sometimes dangerous, as they often do not stop at pedestrian crossings and their exhaust fumes have a bad smell.

"Why participation?" Asked the main guest of the conference, Roel Camps, who is responsible for the involvement and participation of the population in the Antwerp city administration. Camps has developed and tested more than 120 participatory projects involving more than 20,000 young people. He is convinced that a combination of digital participation and field work is key to better involving young people in urban planning. "Residents, including children, need to be involved in planning stages because only in this way can we know their wishes and their experiences add value to future development," Roel Camps emphasized.

The conference was opened by prof. Janez Koželj, Deputy Mayor of the City of Ljubljana, who said that the opportunity for participation lies in the fact that it establishes informal, voluntary and multifaceted communication between residents and city planners, between users of public space and its managers. The goal of the city of Ljubljana is that one day the whole city will become a playful landscape where children can be more relaxed, more active and more creative. As part of the event, there was also a discussion with many Slovenian experts and agents from practice: urban sociologist, dr. Aidan Cerar from the Institute for Spatial Policy, prof. dr. Gregor Jurak from the Faculty of Sports, Nataša Jazbinšek Sršen, Head of the Department of Environmental Protection of the City of Ljubljana, Majda Koren, a youth writer, and Urška Kranjc, a landscape architect, a member of the Pazi! Park Association. In the conversation, with the presentation of good practices of inclusion of children and young people, Mag. Darja Silan from the Jože Plečnik High School, who presented the school roof garden, mag. Maja Brusnjak Hrastar, the initiator of the arrangement of the community meeting place in Novo Polje, and Lovro Planko and Jan Škrjanc, students from Šiška High school, who together with their classmates helped arrange the "school beach", as the students call the new vacation space. The guests emphasized the importance of participation, which can have many positive consequences for all, although cannot be left to individual random cases, but rather be systematically supported.

On an urban walk before the conference, the organizers took visitors through various rooms along Vodnikova cesta from Vodnik's homestead to the Valentin Vodnik Primary School. During the walk, the children talked about the obstacles on their daily way to school, they were mainly bothered by the noise and the difficult crossing of the road despite the pedestrian crossings. At the school playground,

they remembered how years ago, together with members of the PazifPark Association, they greened the playground. "We dug holes and planted trees and shrubs," the students recall: "It was quite difficult because there were a lot of stones. We are now very careful about the planted trees, but we would like to see even more of them on the playground."

Project APPLAUSE – from harmful to useful with citizens' led activities

https://www.ljubljana.si/en/applause/

The project addresses unsolved questions with regard to invasive alien plant species in terms of the zero-waste approach and circular economy.

At present we are composting or incinerating these plants, and with the pilot project for processing plants into paper at a semi-industrial level we have proven that they can be utilised for other useful purposes.

The proposed system of managing invasive foreign plants is based on education and cooperation with the citizens of Ljubljana and three principles of operation:

Do it yourself,
Process with us and
Bring to the collection centre.

We want to make it easier for the citizens of Ljubljana to recognise invasive non-native plant species on their own and then remove and process them into useful products (1). If they do not want to do that by themselves, they will be able to go to the newly planned re-use centre where we can process them together in workshops (2) or they can simply bring them to the new collection centre where project partners can process them into useful products and then sell them (3). The project addresses the widest possible circle of stakeholders: kindergartens, schools, pupils, students, households, property owners, companies, tourists, professional organisations on centre.

Participativni proračun v Četrtni skupnosti Polje

(Participatory budgeting in the Polje District Community)

At the City Municipality, we actively collaborate with representatives of district communities, with whom, in line with expressed needs, initiatives, and capabilities, we agree on the implementation of both small and large-scale projects in district communities (e.g., new green areas, school, kindergarten, and other playgrounds, comprehensive street and road renovations - including the renovation of entire infrastructures, renovations and expansions of cemeteries, renovations of health centers, construction of district centers, etc.).

Every year, we also jointly prepare plans for so-called minor works, through which we implement participatory budgeting. The proof of successful collaboration is evident in many concrete projects that gradually bring life back to all district communities.

Projekt Center Rog

(Project Center Rog)

https://www.ljubljana.si/en/news/rog-centre-opened-its-doors/

On Thursday, 26 October 2023, we opened Rog Centre, a new, open creative centre, where we open the doors wide to cultural and creative people and place manufacturing, design and applied arts at the centre.

Creative Center Rog

The Rog Factory, symbol of the legendary Rog bicycles, is the most important industrial cultural heritage of the 20th century in Ljubljana. With the renovation project and the program of the Rog
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

#

Center, we will preserve the factory building in its original function. In the future, it will operate as a public production space of the 21st century, dedicated to the cultural and creative sector, with an emphasis on manufacturing, design, and applied arts.

## Vision

By revitalizing the former Rog factory into the Rog Center, a new international creative and social center closely integrated into the local environment will be established in the center of Ljubljana. With circular space use, strong cross-sectoral and international orientation, and a commitment to sustainable development, the impact of the Rog Center will extend beyond direct users and positively affect the lives of the broader community.

## Mission

With modern infrastructure, knowledge, and international connections, the Rog Center will provide a creative supportive environment for the development of socially beneficial innovative projects in the fields of manufacturing, urban craftsmanship, applied arts, design, and architecture.

## Rog Center Program

The Rog Center will offer support programs and shared use of modern infrastructure for the needs of actors and creators in the target area (production, educational, event, and exhibition space) on four floors totaling 8,500 m².

## Shared production laboratories

The ground floor and part of the second floor will house production spaces and shared laboratories - both those with modern computer-controlled technologies and those using more traditional techniques: 1) a 3D manufacturing laboratory or fablab with a recycling and electronics laboratory, 2) textile laboratory, 3) woodworking laboratory, 4) metalworking laboratory, 5) green laboratory, 6) glass and ceramic laboratory, 7) multimedia laboratory, and 8) culinary laboratory. This program will be open to the widest audiences: makers, urban craftsmen and artisans, designers, architects, engineers, artists, students, pupils, and enthusiasts of all generations.

## Individual project spaces

These spaces at the Rog Center will be dedicated to makers, urban craftsmen and artisans, designers, architects, engineers, and those active in the field of applied arts. Rog Center will allocate around 25 individual project spaces on 1,250 m² on a non-profit basis (without rent, covering only operational costs) based on public calls from the Rog Center. They will be intended for individuals and collectives developing socially beneficial products in line with the core values of the Rog Center.

## Residential working spaces

Five residential spaces at the Rog Center will be dedicated to accommodation and work for foreign creators, researchers, and lecturers from the target areas of the public institution. The residential working spaces will serve as a tool for international exchange, enabling Slovenian creators to live and work in similar creative centers around the world.

## Exhibition, event, and social spaces

The first floor will host a new unit of the City Library with a professional department in the target areas of the institution. In the field of exhibition and event activities, the Rog Center will offer a 600 m² space for larger events and a multi-purpose lecture hall. Between the library and the hall, there will be a café with an exit to the terrace overlooking the Ljubljanica River. On the ground floor, there will be a bistro with a delicatessen, a restaurant, and 6 retail units with goods and services complementary to the Rog Center program.

## Park (former factory courtyard)

The public park managed by the Rog Center will be a new 8000 m² green area in Ljubljana, intended for daily use by citizens, as well as various public events in the target areas of the Rog Center.

## Accessibility

All individual users of production laboratories, individual workspaces, and residential workspaces will be members of the Rog Center. Upon joining, they will receive a membership card, which will grant them access to the spaces as well as to the machinery and equipment. The membership fee system

5
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

will allow functional space sharing, independent use of space outside official opening hours, and consequently, greater utilization of public infrastructure.

## Development and implementation

The development story of the Rog Center, which began in 2007, is long and complex, and despite the dialogue process involving numerous interest groups, often conflicted. Yet it is unique in Slovenia's history of developing cultural institutions, representing the most extensive example of distinctly community participatory planning of a major public investment. The professional foundations for the vision, mission, and program design of the Rog Center were developed through the pilot project RogLab in close collaboration with users and stakeholders. Between 2010 and 2022, 460 stakeholders, over 80 partner organizations, and over 6000 users from Slovenia and abroad participated in conceptualizing and testing the program.

## Public Institution Creative Center Rog

In June 2021, the City Municipality of Ljubljana established the Public Institution Creative Center Rog. In the initial phase of the new public institution's existence, its focus on infrastructure involves coordinating the program design with the challenging process of renovating a protected cultural heritage building.

Programmatically, the Rog Center will, by 2023, focus on the development and implementation of the following areas of the institution's operation through participatory methods of public involvement: participatory decision-making and budgeting; inclusion of migrant and refugee creators, development of recommendations for gender equality; development of tools to support cross-sectoral creation of socially beneficial products, conceptualization of the park arrangement at the Rog Center, and development of sustainability criteria for the institution. This part of the development process has been financially supported by the European Cultural Foundation.

### LJUBLJANSKI LEDENIK

### (Ljubljana Glacier)

#### An Innovative Initiative to Tackle Heatwaves

Ljubljanski ledenik (the Ljubljana Glacier) is an innovative, interactive urban orientation that seeks to raise public awareness about the dangers of heat waves. Specifically created for residents and visitors of Ljubljana, this project addresses the well-known issue of the heat island effect in the city during the summer months, which poses a significant threat to human health.

The objective of the project is to provide an innovative and easily accessible way of educating the public on the issue of heat waves. The theoretical aspects of protection, preventive measures, health risks, emergency procedures, and other relevant factors are presented in a practical manner through orientation in the urban environment. This approach offers an opportunity for active leisure while directing participants towards safe havens during heatwaves, including cool and shaded areas, and drinking fountains.

#### The project objectives are to:

Providing a comprehensive and innovative way of educating the public about climate change adaptation with a particular emphasis on heat waves. The project intends to educate people about the importance of protection against extreme weather events and sustainable development practices within Ljubljana.
In the springtime, an orientation will be established within the Municipality of Ljubljana, and a map will be created that leads to physical points in space where participants can access the content through a QR code.
The project will organise a one-day event that includes a guided tour of the orientation and other activities.
Additionally, schools and organisations in the Municipality of Ljubljana will be informed about the path's availability for sports days or other activities, ensuring that the content reaches the widest possible audience, including vulnerable groups.

PEŠBUS
(Walking Bus)

The "Pešbus" is a way of organizing and monitoring walking to school for the youngest students, including first graders. Children register for walking to school with the Pešbus in advance and, together with their parents, choose a Pešbus stop where they will join the group. In the morning, the children then gather at the selected stop at a specific time and walk together with supervisors along a carefully planned and marked route to school. Each Pešbus is accompanied by adults. At the beginning of the activity, children receive Pešbus tickets in which they collect stamps for each day of walking and stickers for each week of walking.

In this way, children enjoy a morning walk to school with other children and accompanied by an adult, while parents are relieved of the morning drive and escorting of children to school.

The Pešbus can be implemented in the form of shorter, occasional, and trial periods, or it can be permanent, daily, once a week, or otherwise, as agreed upon by the supervisors, school, and parents. It can be implemented in the first weeks at the beginning of the school year for children to get used to walking to school every day and to become more familiar with the route, or the school can actively encourage and organizationally support the path to school throughout the school year.

Since 2016, more than 150 different schools in Slovenia have implemented the Pešbus.

Projekt URBforDAN – za boljse upravljanje urbanih gozdov
(The URBforDAN Project - for better management of urban forests)

In the Golovec area, we will arrange eight entrance points for visitors, pedestrian and cycling paths, as well as bridle paths. We will install urban equipment, including wooden benches and tables, as well as signs, signposts, and informational boards describing the area as a natural heritage, individual facilities, and other content on site. We will mark an educational trail or several educational points and tools for outdoor education and establish so-called quiet zones with a special space for relaxation.

Users will also have access to a smartphone application that will provide information about the area's content, thus allowing for even better utilization of the newly arranged areas. Specific measures will also depend on the suggestions of participants from various workshops and other events for different audiences.

As a special feature of the project, we are developing participatory and integrated management of urban and suburban forests, which are important areas of natural heritage. The biggest challenge in Ljubljana is the highly fragmented ownership of forests – for comparison: as much as 90% of the forest area in Golovec is privately owned – and the lack of connection and coordination among them, hindering the achievement of the stated goals.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

Within the project, we expect to improve cooperation among key stakeholders (forest managers and owners, users or visitors, experts, non-governmental organizations, etc.), by actively involving them in project activities and measures. We will develop the most effective form of cooperation to connect these groups under the guidance of the City Municipality of Ljubljana and the Slovenian Forestry Institute. This will also serve as a basis for preparing international guidelines and transferring best practices and experiences to other European cities.

Galerija Cukrarna

(Cukrarna Gallery)

The building of the Sugar Factory, formerly a sugar factory, has been renovated and established as the Cukrarna Gallery, providing the city with the largest exhibition space suitable for large and demanding exhibitions, as well as a venue for cultural and artistic events and education. The new multipurpose arts center ensures greater accessibility to culture for all residents, easier promotion of cultural production, and the realization of other major projects. This has also expanded the city center towards the east and provided additional public space for the residents and visitors of Ljubljana.

Works on the largest cultural project in Slovenia began on October 10, 2018. The project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund. The renovation was completed in approximately two years.

The project received a contribution from the Community amounting to EUR 10,774,396.00 from the European Regional Development Fund and a contribution from the Republic of Slovenia's own participation in the amount of EUR 2,693,599.00. Funds for the project are provided through the mechanism of Integrated Territorial Investments, aimed at addressing degradation and revitalizing urban areas.

As part of the Cukrarna Gallery Development Project, we carried out the reconstruction of the existing building, thereby improving the urban environment and further revitalizing the broader city center. Additionally, we removed a physical barrier in the space that hindered mobility in this part of the Poljane Embankment, thus preventing the optimal connection between the city center and urbanized areas to the east of the city. We also enhanced the social aspect of space utilization, as the area with new content and arrangements has become dynamic, programmatically rich, socially vibrant, and a safer and more pleasant place, appealing to both residents and visitors of Ljubljana for repeated visits.

The Cukrarna Gallery will be dedicated to presenting contemporary fine and visual arts, with the two most important biennial events in Ljubljana, BIO Ljubljana and the International Graphic Arts Biennial, undoubtedly playing a significant role. This has addressed the long-standing lack of large exhibition space in Ljubljana.

## Project KAVALIR

Cities to Cities: Electric Minibus Kavalir

In recent years, Slovenian cities have been following the trend of expanding pedestrian areas, aiming to improve the quality of life in urban areas, revitalize city centers, and ultimately promote tourism. In doing so, they face the challenge of maintaining accessibility to pedestrian areas for all residents and city visitors. Ljubljana has addressed this issue by introducing on-demand transportation services, available within pedestrian zones.

Kavalir is one of the measures aimed at introducing environmentally friendly forms of transportation in the city. Ljubljana has recognized the need for alternative mobility services and has enriched the offer of urban public passenger transport. This small electric vehicle is designed to provide free transportation for the elderly, people with mobility impairments, and other residents and visitors within areas that are otherwise closed to traffic.

Kavalir enables unrestricted movement within the pedestrian zone in the city center for seniors and is specifically adapted for people with mobility impairments. Due to its low speed of up to 25 kilometers per hour, it can be stopped during the ride or transportation can be ordered by phone. It can accommodate up to five passengers at once and operates from six in the morning until ten in the evening. Free rides with Kavalir are provided by the public company Ljubljanski potniški promet, which is responsible for maintaining the vehicles and employs drivers.

The first Kavalir hit the streets of Ljubljana in 2008 when it was introduced as an on-demand transportation service as part of the European project CIVITAS ELAN. Due to a positive response and increased demand, additional vehicles were purchased in the following years. Today, there are six Kavalirs operating within the pedestrian zone, with three closed vehicles available all year round and three open ones operating from April to October or depending on the weather. On Sundays and holidays, Kavalir is also available at the Žale Cemetery.

Since Kavalir has also become a unique tourist attraction, an electric tourist train called Urban has been additionally introduced for tourist visits, which follows a set route and connects the sights of Ljubljana (Ljubljana Castle, Špica by the Ljubljanica River, Trnovo, and the Modern and National Galleries).

The service has become an indispensable part of the public transportation services in Ljubljana. In this way, seniors and people with mobility impairments can cover distances and run errands within the pedestrian zone, improving their integration into everyday social life in the city. The success of the practice is also evident in its adoption by other cities, including Kranj (Kranvaj), Maribor (Maister), Koper (Kurjerca), Novo mesto (Leon), and even beyond the borders of Slovenia, such as in Corsica with the "wave and ride" service.

ČEBELJA POT

(BEE PATH)

The Bee Path was conceived and opened in 2016 as one of the activities within the framework of the European Green Capital project in 2016. Originally, it was envisioned merely as an actual path connecting various locations related to beekeeping and bees in Ljubljana. Through the participatory approach with individual members, it became evident that the path is much more than just a work program or project. It became synonymous with all activities related to bees and beekeeping in Ljubljana.

Today, the Bee Path in Ljubljana represents:

A physical trail that connects the city and the countryside into a whole. Visitors can experience Ljubljana from a different perspective by walking along the path – they can learn about the cultural and natural heritage associated with beekeeping in Ljubljana, witness active beekeeping processes, as well as taste and purchase honey and other bee products.
A network of beekeepers, cultural, educational, and health organizations, companies, non-governmental organizations, as well as individuals interested in beekeeping and its development in urban areas.
An educational program aimed at raising awareness among key target groups about the importance of bees, from the youngest to adults, as well as promoting comprehensive and sustainable management of urban and rural areas.
A think-tank and incubator for the development of new entrepreneurial ideas in beekeeping and new bee products and services.

Climate Neutrality Action Plan

A movement that connects all interested parties who want to maintain high environmental awareness, preserve bees in urban areas, and further develop urban beekeeping in Ljubljana, as well as a strong advocate for the international initiative for World Bee Day.
The Bee Path connects two important contents for our development and existence – biodiversity conservation on one hand and local self-sufficiency, as two-thirds of food depends on pollinators.

In the Bee Path, we have set the following goals:

Increase and develop beekeeping in the wider area of the City Municipality of Ljubljana (education of beekeepers, financial assistance for the development of activities, co-financing the operations of five beekeeping associations).
Development of beekeeping in the urban core, with an emphasis on safety, awareness, and education of citizens, rules of beekeeping in urban areas...
Creation of new tourist products with the presentation of natural and cultural heritage related to beekeeping in the city.
Education of the youngest and the creation of educational programs.
Development of new urban apiaries and bee stations.

# SOCIAL COHESION AND SOLIDARITY

Šmartinski Park, Playground

https://landezine.com/smartinski-park-playground-by-luz/

We are transforming degraded, neglected, and underutilized parts of the city into new green areas, thereby contributing to mitigating climate change and enhancing the quality of leisure time for residents and visitors of Ljubljana (parks, gardens, playgrounds, urban orchards, etc.). Since 2006, we have established over 90 hectares of new green spaces.

Amidst the hustle and bustle of traffic, the park offers an opportunity for relaxation in a pleasant green area.

Today's Šmartinski Park used to be a vast area of informal and individuals allotment gardens. In the municipal spatial planning documents the area was defined as green space and an infrastructural corridor, but in reality it was covered with garden beds and sheds, cut by a traffic road and crossed by a few main power lines. Still in 2007, the area mainly served as a buffer zone between busy roads and the city's central cemetery Žale and was constantly referred to as a problem zone. The main reason for the criticism was the contradiction of unregulated gardening and the iconic architecture of the Žale cemetery, designed by recognized Slovene architect Jože Plečnik. Ironically, allotment gardening was indeed planned on the site in late 1950s but went out of control when years went by. At its final stage, gardening here was declared illegal, nobody knew how many individual gardens there are or who they belonged to. The area consisted of vegetable beds with various wooden or tin shacks and small constructions, scattered around. The area was planted randomly with different fruit trees and numerous perennials. From the outside, the place seemed unfriendly, even confusing and difficult to cross, belonging to a closed community of gardeners.

Back in 2007, the area was first in a row to be cleared of illegal allotment in the Municipality of Ljubljana to demonstrate new urban development and management policy. The clearing of gardening beds and sheds was announced and executed in a close cooperation between mayor's office, municipal officials and public companies. This most delicate action was carried out with a lot of sensitivity to the gardeners and the future of gardening in the city as well as for the area's future development. The allotment gardeners were able to get explanations from the mayor on site, the vice major gathered a professional team to mark and protect the existing trees form construction damage, and a new gardening policy was announced publicly. Rehabilitation was discussed and planned along with fieldwork which led to an idea of minimal intervention. After clearing of the area only a flowering lawn mixture was sown in the first season and the area was open to public use while the process of planning and designing started. The nearby local communities were consulted about their wishes and they confirmed a need for a new park and playground. The area was to become a public

park in a new master plan and the road that was bisecting the area was to be omitted from it. The new park was to become Šmartinski Park, named after a road nearby.

Due to its vast dimension of nearly 13 ha, the transformation of the area into a park was to be gradual, starting the process in 2007, step by step reaching its climax in 2015 by constructing one of the city's biggest and most exciting playgrounds. In the first phase of park development only two basic walkthrough paths were erected, the terrain was reshaped and new large trees were planted while remnants of existing fruit trees were left on site. The playground was designed later due to many requests. The initial design idea was to provide a play area for all, no matter the age, physical or mental ability. The playground location was planned carefully, with a proper relation to the cemetery, behind a gas station and out of impacts of main road and power lines. The design team's previous experiences with school and nursery kids participating in various play projects were used as most valuable baseline for a new design concept. The design itself was to provide spaciousness, playful terrain, water feature in combination with sand, lots of vegetation and play equipment with a diverse set of functions – a high climbing net with a view being one of its essentials. Playful water feature and path design were moulded to the park layout, adding soft curved circular shapes with high play value to the existing straight functional park paths.

The transformation of allotment into a park was very well accepted almost from the beginning, even the gardeners recognized the quality of open public space and requests for a playground started to reach the city hall in the first season of park operation. At first idea of a playground in front of a cemetery sounded a bit unusual but life proves it right: people wished to have a playground constructed in a park more than anything and the visitors today are coming from near and far, even from outside of Ljubljana. Some of the users initiated ideas, such as circular paths for running or scooter riding with graphic length marks, a wavy up and down path and a softly curved hill with assortment of slides are the busiest features alongside water play – pumps, dams, channels or mills in combination with sand, a rarity in Ljubljana's otherwise diverse play options. Playground safety (gravel in combination with sand) is fully provided by careful detailing without abundant constructional additions. After the playground was open, many people visited it, proposing additional bike racks and a dog park and both of proposals were realised. Recent popularity of the park also triggered an expected initiative to build a teahouse with necessary service features for the park and playground users.

# ENTREPRENEURSHIP, SOCIAL ECONOMY, SOCIAL AWARENESS AND MOBILISATION, Projects for the Digital Development Strategy of the Municipality of Ljubljana

With the first Strategy of Digital Development in Ljubljana, we aim to achieve the goal of simpler and more user-friendly collaboration with the city's residents. Processes in which residents engage with city management will be simplified, making city management more efficient and transparent.

The process of shaping this strategy has been going on for eighteen months, involving participation of residents, city administration, experts and political decision-makers. The collaboration included individual and group interviews, surveys, workshops and online discussions with the public.

The vision of digital development of the City of Ljubljana will further promote Ljubljana as a pleasant and green city for everyday life. Human-centered development, supported by modern digital solutions, will address the real challenges faced by the city's residents, enhance the existing urban services, and assist city managers in faster responding to risks.

The Digital Development Strategy is based on the values and principles reflected in the Vision of Ljubljana 2025. Ljubljana needs to remain a city tailored to its residents, a green and a healthy city that promotes fair economic progress, provides (digital) security to its residents, and operates transparently.

# 5 Outlook and next steps

This section should draw any necessary conclusions on the CCC Action Plan above and highlight next steps and plans for refining the CCC Action Plan as part of the Climate City Contract in future iterations.

## Plans for next CCC and CCC Action Plan iteration

Building on the knowledge and experience gained during the drafting of the Climate City Agreement and based on successful practices in the past, a key focus will be on maintaining the momentum and stability of the established stakeholder processes.

Joint initiatives have been launched since November 2022. In addition, several new projects resulting from these efforts are already underway, such as the development of energy renovation models for the city's building stock, the revitalisation of inner courtyards and the modelling of urban heat islands, to name but a few.

Success in creating a favourable environment for all stakeholders to work together will play a crucial role. The focus is on understanding fields of action and recognising their interconnectedness.

Central to this approach is the promotion of a positive attitude that emphasises the collective strength, belonging and responsibility that comes from working together in the form of joint actions, projects and research and development.

The Climate City Contract is an ongoing process that will be implemented through the following measures:

existing and newly formed partnerships as well as stakeholder groups, including the local transition team (consisting of CCT city government departments, city public enterprises and interested stakeholder groups) and specialised focus team stakeholders. Activities will continue in line with the CCC Participatory-Communication Strategy (CCC-PCS).
the dynamic nature of the action plan emphasises continuous learning and focuses on collaboration, reflection, and improvement. Efforts to create robust frameworks, gain the support of policy makers and increase stakeholder engagement will continue. Obtaining additional signatures/commitments from various stakeholders as identified in the stakeholder map created as part of this dynamic approach will be perused.
identify and develop new funding opportunities, grants and partnerships with the public and private sector. Ensuring a steady flow of resources will enable the continuation and expansion of projects aligned with the CCC Participatory-Communication Strategy (CCC-PCS) and strengthen the City's commitment to achieving its climate neutrality goals.
the newly established Climate Change Council of the City of Ljubljana will be appointed by the mayor within two months of receiving the EU Mission Seal. The Council will hold its first joint meeting within one month of its appointment to draw up a work plan that includes advice on planning and implementation measures and closely monitors impacts.
Climate Neutrality Action Plan

one year after receiving the seal, the city's transition team will prepare an annual report on the implementation of the CCC. This reports, prepared in collaboration with various stakeholders, will include all activities related to CCC implementation, indicators, including stakeholder engagement efforts, during the year. The report will be presented to interested parties (public), whose considerations will be incorporated into the final report, which will also be reviewed by the Council for Climate Change City and City Council. The CCC will be supplemented by annual reports in the form of annexes. An updated of CCC (every two years) will be uploaded into Mission Platform. An update will also include a report on the status and progress of the measures implemented in the organisations that have committed to the CCC (signatories to the CCC) in the areas they have identified or implemented that address the climate neutrality targets. This approach enables the evaluation of signatories' effectiveness and commitment, informs investment, and encourages further progress and improvements in the CCC processes. The final decision on the measures to be taken based on yearly reports lies with the Mayor and the City Council. Indicator reporting will be conducted annually on the CDP/ICLEI platform, reflecting Ljubljana's consistent yearly submissions to the platform since 2017.

a digital platform will be set up within a year to support numerous activities in the field of climate protection.

a key perspective arising from the development of the Climate City Contract is also that future revisions of strategies, policies and other programmes will incorporate key elements identified as gaps in the development of the action plan, taking Mission 100 into account. The main focus will be on the coherence and interdependence of the areas and on the integration and monitoring of the indicators described in Mission 100. Particular emphasis will be placed on the coherence and interdependence of the domains, together with the integration and monitoring of the indicators outlined in Mission 100.

exploring and adopting innovative technologies and solutions will play a central role in accelerating progress towards climate neutrality. This includes keeping pace with advances in CCU technologies, smart city technologies, sustainable transport, behavioural change, regulatory frameworks, and new employment opportunities. Through established and new partnerships with universities, technology companies, research institutions and innovation centres, the city will begin to test innovative solutions that have the potential for scalability and significant impact on reducing carbon emissions.

lobbying to ensure that the political and regulatory framework is conducive to achieving carbon neutrality. This means lobbying policy makers, regulators, and other government agencies to adopt progressive environmental policies, incentivise green investments and regulations that promote sustainable practices. Concerted efforts will be made through lobbying, public campaigns and stakeholder alliances and regulatory sandboxes to influence policy formulation and regulatory adjustments in favour of climate action in the city.

improving the expertise of the city administration and project teams is key to achieving the objectives of the Climate City Contract. The focus will be on targeted training and education initiatives to improve skills relevant to the Climate City. Collaboration with educational institutions and professional organisations will be prioritised to ensure a well-informed and competent workforce ready to tackle the challenges of climate action in the coming period.

establishing a CCC as the new normal, with the aim of institutionalising it and strengthening mindset and content integration efforts. The new normal is characterised by the following:

The CCC, as well as other city policies, functions as a unified policy.
The City Transitional Team ensures co-operation at all levels.
The City of Ljubljana Climate Change Council, which involves the interested public and city councillors, monitors the progress of the CCC annually.
The city's CCC is regularly addressed at regional and national level and in line with international targets.
Co-operation agreements and implemented projects imply the integration of the signed CCC commitments in the daily work of all stakeholders. Partnerships with universities, citizens' initiatives, non-governmental organisations, and others demonstrate inclusive governance.
The dynamic nature of the action plan reflects continuous learning and emphasises collaboration, reflection, and continuous improvement.
The goal of climate neutrality is an integral part of Ljubljana's operational culture.
